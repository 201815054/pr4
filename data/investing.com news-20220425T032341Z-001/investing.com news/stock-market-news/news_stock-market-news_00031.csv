0,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 01, 2020 07:30PM ET</span>","Banks wary of liquidity extend expensive, shorter-dated credit to GE","By Michelle Sierra
NEW YORK (LPC) -  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Co is asking its lenders to replace US$20bn in revolving loans with a new debt package that will come with a smaller size and shorter maturities, sources said.
The new loans, that will come at the reduced size of US$15bn, are a testament to a changing bank landscape as firms seek to get better compensated for the risk they take to lend as volatility rattles the markets. 
A shorter commitment window of three years bodes well for the banks lending to the multinational conglomerate at a time when liquidity is golden. 
JP Morgan,  Citigroup  (NYSE:C), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC),  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) lead the GE loans.
“During times of volatility, banks prefer to be out with a three-year loan, and not a five-year loan. A shorter-term maturity is going to be less risky,” a banking source said.
The reduced financing size was agreed to at the onset of the discussions with banks and before the coronavirus fears rattled the markets. 
“GE has divested a number of assets. The loans are more in line with GE’s current size,” a source close to the company said. 
The shorter-dated loan, however, is also better for banks as longer-term capital is more expensive, especially for those institutions that borrow overnight to fund themselves. 
The Basel II and Basel III capital agreements monitor the minimum capital that banks need to hold as a cushion against insolvency. The accords require banks to hold capital against the funded and unfunded revolving credit lines they provide to their corporate clients. 
During times of uncertainty, unlike the bond market that offers prepayment penalties to banks, lenders in the loan market prefer shorter-dated commitments. 
“The loan market wants to go shorter because banks are very uncomfortable with their own cost of liquidity,” a second banking source said.
In recent days, better-rated companies such as General Motors (NYSE:GM), Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co, Anheuser-Busch InBev and Petrobras opted to hoard liquidity as they borrowed from revolving credit lines that they usually leave untapped. 
According to JP Morgan, by March 27 there had been US$227bn in revolver drawdowns. And although liquidity is yet to be impacted, more drawdowns are expected to follow.
The banks’ inability to repay its liabilities with sufficiently liquid assets is considered to be a large cause of the financial crisis. 
JP Morgan, Citi, BNP and Morgan Stanley declined to comment. BAML and Goldman did not return immediate requests to comment.
GE’S DEAL 
To replace US$20bn in loans set to expire in 2021, GE was originally looking to do a three-year and a five-year loan. But given the uncertainty in the market, only a shorter-date financing was available.
“As part of our normal financial management process, we are refinancing a back-up credit facility that expires in 2021. Our financial position is sound, including US$20bn of cash proceeds from closing the sale of BioPharma on March 31,” a GE spokesperson said in a emailed statement to Refinitiv LPC.
The financing, that launched early this week, is expected to price higher than the existing loan.
GE is now looking to pay 15bp undrawn and 137.5bp over Libor when the facility is drawn for a three-year loan.
GE originally paid 10bp undrawn on the five-year and 9bp undrawn on the three-year portion.
“GE is obviously a company with a big bank following and a big wallet and their shrinking the deal size so the expectation is that it will go okay. Everyone is watching,” the second banking source said. 
With significant exposure to the energy and transportation sectors, lending to GE is now a tougher ask for banks, the second banking source said. 

The company recently announced its plans to lay off 10% of its US workers at its aviation unit amid COVID-19 hits to air travel and aircraft demand. The company has also logged significant losses in its energy division.

3,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 01, 2020 05:54PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch for April 2,"By Kim Khan 
Investing.com - Without expectation for a positive economic event, like the stimulus package, Wall Street is finding itself reacting to increasing Covid-19 infection and death figures, and finding little support agains thte selling.
Florida, the third-most populated state in the country, finally issued a stay-at-home order as U.S. infections topped 200,000.
The numbers won’t be encouraging when it comes to economic data tomorrow. But a report from Walgreens might help with transparency on testing.
Here are three things that could move the markets tomorrow.
1. Jobless Claims in the Millions Again
Initial jobless claims gave the market the first grim picture of a coronavirus-hit economy last week and the numbers are expected to be even grimmer tomorrow.
The Labor Department will release the weekly figures at 8:30 AM ET (12:30 GMT).
Economists expect claims for first-time unemployment benefits to have jumped by 3.5 million last week. Continuing claims are seen coming in at about 4.8 million.
But the numbers could certainly be worse, with the New York State Labor Department, between March 23 and March 28, receiving more than 8.2 million calls compared with just 50,000 in a typical week, Investing.com’s Kathy Lien said.
If there can be a positive way to look at the numbers, it may be that a large number of claims means that displaced workers are availing themselves of the backstop support provided in the stimulus bill. That would keep much-needed disposable income in the economy.
2. Layoffs Numbers Also Arriving
Also on the jobs front, outplacement firm Challenger, Gray and Christmas will issue its report on March layoffs at 7:30 AM ET (11:30 GMT).
It’s not clear how much of the March shutdowns the survey will have captured, but on Monday Challenger reported on an online survey of more than 250 companies.
Almost 50% of the companies said they were at least somewhat likely to lay off staff due to Covid-19 and more than a third have instituted a hiring freeze, Challenger said, according to CNBC.
The survey was conducted from March 20-26, a time when coronavirus cases in the U.S. were around 18,000, compared with 200,000 passed today.
3. Walgreens Could Give Testing Update
Dow component Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) reports earnings before the bell tomorrow and numbers won’t mean as much as its assessment of the economy from the perspective of an essential retailer.
Investors will also be looking for an update on testing for Covid-19, with many complaining the U.S. is still not testing nearly enough, especially when compared to nations like South Korea.
On March 13, Walgreens was named by the White House as one of the companies dedicating space in parking lots to facilitate testing, but that hasn’t started yet.
Analysts are expecting the drugstore chain earned a quarterly profit of $1.46 per share on sales of about $35.3 billion, according to forecasts compiled by Investing.com."

6,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 01, 2020 05:15PM ET</span>",Federal Reserve temporarily eases some bank leverage requirements,"By Pete Schroeder
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Reserve announced on Wednesday it was temporarily easing its leverage rules for large banks by exempting certain investments from a key leverage calculation, part of the effort to combat the economic slowdown inflicted by the coronavirus pandemic.
Now, banks will be able to exempt any holdings in U.S. Treasury debt or deposits at the Fed from their calculations of the supplementary leverage ratio, or SLR, an additional leverage restriction imposed on the largest U.S. banks. 
The exemptions, which the Fed said will help ease strains in the Treasury market and encourage banks to continue lending, will stay in place until March 31, 2021.
The leverage restrictions easing marks the latest attempt by the Fed to ensure that banks can continue to lend during the slowdown due to the pandemic. 
The SLR, which applies to banks with over $250 billion in assets, was created by the U.S. central bank following the 2007-2009 financial crisis that saw banks nearly collapse after a national housing crisis. The rule, which directs banks to hold a certain percentage of capital as a cushion against its assets, was aimed at ensuring the largest institutions had an extra layer of protection against any future downturns.
In a statement, the Fed said liquidity conditions in the market for U.S. government debt had ""deteriorated rapidly,"" and banks were seeing a significant increase in customer deposits as people shied away from riskier investments.
The end result was that banks, in an effort to adhere to a rule that requires them to hold more capital against a growing amount of assets, may have been pushed to offload lower-yielding Treasury bonds, shrink Fed deposits, or slow their lending. The supplementary leverage ratio directs larger banks to hold more capital against their assets.
By exempting those safer investments from the formula, the Fed said it would allow banks to expand their balance sheets and keep lending.
The vote to ease the rule, which generally applies to banks with over $250 billion in assets, was unanimous as Democratic Fed Governor Lael Brainard supported the change after opposing pre-pandemic efforts by the Fed to ease bank rules.
The Fed also underlined in a statement announcing the change that it is intended to help banks lend, not give it another opportunity to boost payouts to investors. The rule change is aimed at ensuring banks act as ""financial intermediaries, rather than to allow banking organizations to increase capital distributions.""

The Fed said it would ""administer the interim final rule accordingly.""

7,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 01, 2020 05:00PM ET</span>",Challengers rev their engines to fight Trump's auto emissions weakening,"By David Shepardson and Lawrence Hurley
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Just two months after taking office, President Donald Trump in March 2017 traveled to Michigan to announce that he would undo ambitious vehicle emissions standards mandated under his predecessor Barack Obama, portraying the reversal as a boost to the U.S. auto industry centered in the Midwestern state.
""The assault on the American auto industry is over,"" the Republican president said at the time.
It took Trump's administration three years to follow through on his promise. And an expected court challenge led by California could delay implementation until after the Nov. 3 election in which Trump is seeking a second term in office, meaning it is possible his successor could scrap the plan without it ever having taken effect.
""The federal government's math still doesn't add up after all these months of trying to retool and rework their rule,"" California Attorney General Xavier Becerra said, accusing the administration of failing to comply with federal law in the plan announced on Tuesday.
The challengers getting ready to sue - a coalition of more than 20 Democratic-led states as well as environmental groups - are planning to target much of the analysis and underlying assumptions used by the administration in crafting the plan, which ditches the Obama-era requirement of 5% annual increases in efficiency for cars and trucks through 2026 in favor of 1.5% annual increases.
The plaintiffs are expected to challenge the administration's contentions that the weaker efficiency standards will reduce future vehicle prices by $1,000 by reducing automaker compliance costs. The administration contends that less expensive sticker prices will entice motorists to more quickly buy new cars that are safer than their older vehicles.
The litigation is expected to be filed in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit once the 2,000 pages of rules are formally published in the coming weeks. Seven of that court's 11 active judges were appointed by Democratic presidents, suggesting it may be unfriendly territory for the administration.
The new policy means the U.S. vehicle fleet will be required to average 40.4 miles (65 km) per gallon rather than 46.7 mpg (75 km) under the Obama rules.
Trump's administration, which has erased a series of Obama-era environmental initiatives that it deemed burdensome to industry, said the new rules will result in about 2 billion additional barrels of oil being consumed and 867 to 923 additional million metric tons of carbon dioxide being emitted.
Automakers have yet to announce how they will approach the coming litigation.
They must decide whether to intervene and, if so, on which side. Most automakers intervened on behalf of Trump's administration when states sued to block its decision to revoke California's ability to set its own emissions standards or require a rising number of zero-emission vehicles, while some have sought to broker a deal with California. That case is still pending.
'SIGNIFICANT WEAKNESSES'
In the coming legal fight, the challengers can cite as evidence the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency science advisory board's January finding of ""significant weaknesses in the scientific analysis"" of the proposed rollback.
Acting National Highway Traffic Safety Administration chief James Owens called the administration's analysis ""very cautious"" and said it ""best reflects what our experts are telling us."" 
Trump administration officials also said the Obama-era rules, announced in 2012, included many assumptions that turned out to be wrong including on fuel prices and the mix of passenger cars and SUVs.
""Basically the automakers have to be living under a lot of uncertainty over the outcome,"" said David Doniger, a lawyer with the Natural Resources Defense Council environmental group. ""If I were in their shoes, I would say you don't have a very secure basis for relying on this rule.""
One of the strategic questions facing the challengers is whether to file a stay application seeking to put the rule on hold while the litigation continues, a decision lawyers working with the potential plaintiffs have said they have not yet made. 
Among the considerations is how likely they would be to obtain such a court order and if they do, whether the Supreme Court, with a 5-4 conservative majority including two justices appointed by Trump, would overturn it. 
Trump's administration has had considerable success in filing emergency applications at the Supreme Court on such issues as implementing his hardline immigration policies and his restrictions on transgender people joining the military. 
In 2016, the Supreme Court blocked the Obama administration's Clean Power Plan aimed at limiting greenhouse gas emissions mainly from coal-burning power plants from taking effect. Trump subsequently scrapped the initiative.

Trump's presumptive Democratic election challenger is Joe Biden, who served as Obama's vice president and could quickly seek to re-impose the Obama-era standards if he wins - even if the litigation is still ongoing.

Investing.com – The Dow plunged as a wave of late selling hit Wall Street Wednesday as investors pulled their bullish bets on stocks on rising fears the economic hit from the Covid-19 pandemic could be worse than feared, with infections in the U.S. topping 200,000.
The Dow fell 4.4%, or 974 points, but was down more than a 1,000 points at the lows of the day. The S&P 500 fell 4.4% and the Nasdaq Composite fell 4.4%.
President Donald Trump's grim warning that two weeks of pain lie ahead of the U.S.,was made all the more chilling as infections in the U.S. continued to mount, forcing several states, including Florida, Nevada and Pennsylvania, to issue ""stay at home"" orders for at least 30 days.
Coronavirus infections in the U.S. topped 200,000 Wednesday, with about 4,700 dead so far.
With more states going into lockdown, fears of a deeper and darker recession continue to rise. Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) warned of further economic pain in the second quarter, but added that a quick recovery would ensue after the virus is contained.
In China, meanwhile, hopes that the country could be on the road to recovery suffered a setback following a fresh outbreak and growing doubts over the veracity of Beijing's official coronavirus infection and death count.
A county in central China’s Henan province went into lockdown following several infections in the area, Reuters reported.
Real estate, utilities, which traditionally serve as defensive corners, led the bruising sell on Wall Street.
Energy was also under pressure as oil prices settled lower on growing fears about a glut in supply as U.S. inventories continue to build. But sentiment on oil was helped by reports that Trump is reportedly set to meet with oil company CEOs to find a way to bring some much-needed stability to the market.
Tech was also shunned, paced by a steep decline in chip stocks as investors scaled back some of their late-quarter bullish bets on the sector. Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) was among the biggest losers, falling 7%, dragging the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index 5.5% lower.
In economic news, U.S. manufacturing fell into contraction last month and the private sector cut 27,000 jobs last month, less than the 150,000 expected. The labor data comes just days before the all-important nonfarm payrolls due Friday."

11,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 01, 2020 03:45PM ET</span>",Goldman’s Joseph Cohen Sees ‘Awful’ Data Before Growth,"(Bloomberg) -- The U.S. economy will see the biggest damage in the next couple of months from the coronavirus lockdowns, and unemployment will surge before growth starts to recover later this year,  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS).’s Abby Joseph Cohen said in an interview on Bloomberg TV.
“The demand shock is heavily concentrated in services, of course, and we think that from a time standpoint, April and May will bear the brunt of it because of the constraints on all of us in terms of whether we can get around,” the senior investment strategist said. “What we’re hoping is that when we get to the latter part of this year, and some of these physical constraints imposed on us are lifted, we’ll start to see that the economy can begin to recover in a better way.”
Goldman economists expect the U.S. economy to shrink an annualized 34% in the second quarter before expanding by 19% in the third, while forecasting that the jobless rate will soar to 15% by mid-year as the lockdowns weigh on employers.
U.S. equities are coming off their worst quarterly slump since the aftermath of the Lehman Brothers collapse in 2008 on worries about the fallout from the pandemic. The ADP (NASDAQ:ADP) Research Institute data on Wednesday showed employment at U.S. firms declined in March for the first time since 2017 and businesses’ payrolls dropped by 27,000. The report precedes the widely monitored non-farm figures from the Labor Department due on Friday.
“The most accurate numbers we’ll get on a real-time basis most likely will be the labor market data, we’re expecting those to look pretty awful over the next several months,” said Joseph Cohen, who in the 1990s was the most famous equity strategist in America.
Several major U.S. retailers are halting pay for hundreds of thousands of workers as they struggle to cope with the slump in demand caused by measures to control the spread of the virus. President Donald Trump recently extended U.S. “social distancing” guidelines to contain the virus until the end of April, abandoning his ambition to return American life to normal by Easter.
Joseph Cohen praised the actions of the U.S. Federal Reserve, saying that monetary stimulus is “having the desired effect.” Since the start of the coronavirus crisis in the U.S., Goldman strategists have been concerned about the availability of capital to small and mid-sized businesses and individuals as well as their solvency, according to her.
Optimism about the unprecedented stimulus measures boosted U.S. equities over the past week, tempering losses in the first quarter.
The Goldman strategist also noted that the U.S. banking system is now in a “much better shape” because of the measures that had been taken following the 2008 financial crisis.
The impact of the pandemic has highlighted economic and income disparities across the U.S., she said.
“This health crisis is unveiling a number of problems and stresses within the economy that perhaps were hidden,” said Joseph Cohen. “We’re going to need as a country to think about what we’ve learned in terms of variations in access to health care, variations in access to employment and so on.”

Investing.com - The Dow plunged on Wednesday, a day after suffering its worst first-quarter loss ever, as fears over the Covid-19 pandemic intensified with several states going into lockdown to curb the outbreak.
The Dow fell 4.60%, or 1,000 points. The S&P 500 slipped 4.81% and the Nasdaq Composite fell 4.71%.
In a sign of the outbreak is gathering pace in the U.S., Florida Governor Ron DeSantis issued ""stay at home"" order for at least 30 days, with Nevada and Pennsylvania also imposing similar measures just a day after President Donald Trump's grim warning that a ""painful two weeks"" lie ahead for the U.S.
The ramp-up in lockdown measures in the U.S. comes as New York state, the epicenter of the outbreak in the U.S., saw a jump in cases 83,712 from 75,795 on Tuesday.
China, meanwhile, suffered a setback after a county in central China’s Henan province went into lockdown, following several infections in the area, Reuters reported. The fresh outbreak comes as some question whether China has concealed the real number of infections and deaths in the country.
China has deliberately under-reported the total number of coronavirus cases and deaths in the country, the U.S. intelligence community told the White House, Bloomberg reported, citing sources.
Defensive corners of the market were unable to sidestep the sea of red on Wall Street, with real estate and utility stocks pacing the broader market decline.

(Reuters) - Whiting Petroleum Corp filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, the U.S. shale producer said on Wednesday, the first publicly traded casualty of crashing crude oil prices that are expected to bite into record U.S. output.
Whiting, once the largest oil producer in North Dakota's Bakken region, said its creditors have agreed to cut its debt by about $2.2 billion through an exchange of some of its notes for 97% of new equity. Existing shareholders will own 3% of the reorganized company.
Many shale oil and gas producers are faced with burdensome debt loads and have cut spending aggressively as oil prices have plunged by about two-thirds this year. The coronavirus pandemic is slamming fuel demand, while Russia and Saudi Arabia are boosting supply in a fight for a shrinking market. 
A U.S. drilling boom over the last three years lifted national oil production to a record of roughly 13 million barrels per day, but investors have grown frustrated with poor returns. Callon Petroleum and other companies have hired advisors to restructure debt.
Shares of Whiting were down 44% at 37 cents. 
The company's market valuation has shrunk to $61.5 million from as much as $15 billion at its peak in 2011, when investors were discovering the burgeoning shale sector. As of Dec. 31, Whiting had $2.8 billion in debt and more than $585 million in cash on its balance sheet. 
Whiting is among the most shorted oil and gas stocks, with more than 60% of its outstanding shares borrowed for short selling, according to FIS Astec Analytics data.
SunTrust Robinson Humphrey analyst Neal Dingmann said filing for bankruptcy ""was more of a temporary solution than a long-term sustainable plan.""
""We believe this financial demise was due to a combination of difficult macro conditions combined with sub-par operations for several quarters,"" Dingmann said. 
Analysts believe the energy sector is primed for more defaults in coming months. Whiting's bankruptcy brings the trailing 12-month high-yield energy default rate to more than 11%, and the year-end figure could ultimately surpass the 19.7% level set in January 2017, according to Fitch Ratings.
Energy producers Chesapeake Energy Corp (NYSE:CHK) and Chaparral Energy Inc as well as natural gas producer Gulfport Energy Corp are working with debt restructuring advisers or investment banks to shore up cash reserves.
Whiting was expected to produce about 42 million barrels of oil equivalent in 2020. It said it would continue to operate without material disruption to vendors, partners or employees. 
It expects sufficient liquidity to meet financial obligations during the restructuring without additional financing.

Moelis & Co is Whiting's financial adviser, while Alvarez & Marsal is its restructuring adviser. PJT Partners is acting as financial adviser for creditors.

(Reuters) - T-Mobile US (NASDAQ:TMUS) Inc said on Wednesday it officially completed the $23 billion merger with Sprint Corp, solidifying its position as the No.3 wireless providers in the United States.
The deal comes after a long legal battle between multiple state attorneys general which argued that a merger between T-Mobile and Sprint would be anticompetitive. 
The combined company will now operate under the T-Mobile name and will trade on the NASDAQ as ""TMUS.""
The deal also enables T-Mobile and Sprint to join their high-band and low-band spectrum that could allow a faster roll-out of national 5G.
Sprint acknowledged risks in an SEC filing, saying that its internal controls over financial reporting could negatively impact the combined company. 
A U.S. federal judge approved the deal, which was originally valued at $26 billion, in February, rejecting a claim by a group of states that the proposed transaction would violate antitrust laws and raise prices.
The deal closed without a final decision from the California Public Utilities Commission. The CPUC issued a proposed decision in March to approve the merger of T-Mobile and Sprint with conditions and the final decision is slated to come on April 16.
T-Mobile and Sprint agreed to abide by any provisions set forth by the California commission.
Also, on Wednesday, a federal judge in Washington gave court approval to the Justice Department’s decision to approve the merger. The department had given its approval to the deal in July on condition the combined wireless company sell off assets to Dish Network, making the latter the fourth-largest provider in the U.S. wireless space.
The Federal Communications Commission signed off on the deal in October. FCC Chairman Ajit Pai applauded the decision and said that it would boost the U.S. position in the race to 5G.
T-Mobile's long-time Chief Executive John Legere is stepping down from his position effective immediately as part of the deal.
Legere was originally set to leave at the end of April, with Mike Sievert, T-Mobile's president, as his successor. Legere, who helped launched the company's notable ""Un-carrier"" strategy, will serve on T-Mobile's board of directors.

T-Mobile shares rose 2.34% on the announcement.

Invesing.com – Tesla faces a bittersweet near-term future as its deliveries will likely fall short of the target, but the electric automaker's cash pile will help it ride out the Covid-19 pandemic, Bernstein said.
""The company’s pain is likely to extend through the second and third quarters as the economic weakness wrought by the coronavirus pandemic could dwarf anything seen during the Great Recession,"" Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi said in a note.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) fell 6%.  
Bernstein forecasts that Tesla will miss its unit sales goal this year, pressuring revenue to fall by fifth.
Others on Wall Street agree. 
""To this point, we now believe (Tesla) hitting the 500,000 unit delivery threshold for 2020 is a virtual impossibility,"" Wedbush said, estimating deliveries to within a 400,000 to 425,000 range.
But while many companies are desperate to build up their cash concerns on an expected slowdown in activity amid coronavirus-led recession, Tesla is not one of them as its recent equity raise gives it plenty of room to weather the storm. 
""On the brighter side, Tesla's cash balance is likely to hit its lowest point of around $6.6 billion in the second quarter, and Tesla only has about $100 million of debt due this year, and is facing a $1.4 billion convertible bonds in March 2021,"" Bernstein added.
Tesla is expected to release the first-quarter delivery and production numbers later this week, which will provide investors with an insight into the impact from the coronavirus pandemic, especially in ""the all-important China region with Giga 3 front and center,"" Wedbush said.
""We believe Tesla, like every other auto manufacturer, is seeing demand softness globally over the last month as consumers remain in a virtual lockdown,"" it added.

24,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 01, 2020 01:50PM ET</span>","Exclusive: Fiat Chrysler, GM try discounts, online buying to lift plunging U.S. sales","By Nick Carey and Rachit Vats
(Reuters) - With auto showrooms shut during the coronavirus pandemic,  Fiat  Chrysler and General Motors Co (N:GM) moved to reboot demand with seven-year, no-interest loans and programs allowing customers to buy vehicles online.
Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV's (MI:FCHA) (N:FCAU) new ""Drive Forward"" marketing program includes online shopping tools that will for the first time allow U.S. customers to complete the purchase of a vehicle through an FCA dealer without setting foot in a dealership, a company spokesman said.
The move toward online sales and home delivery breaks with a long U.S. auto sector tradition of manufacturers giving franchised dealers control of sales to consumers. Dealers have fought Tesla Inc's (O:TSLA) efforts to sell vehicles directly to consumers through its website.
GM and Fiat Chrysler's promotions of extended, no-interest loans - made less costly by the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cuts - echo the ""Keep America Rolling"" sales push GM launched to jump start a paralyzed consumer market after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks.
But the pandemic has been pulling auto retailing into the digital age, with dealerships shuttered across the country and sales likely to take a further beating in April as social distancing guidelines remain in place. [nL1N2BN18I]
FCA shares were down 4.9% to $6.84 in afternoon trading in New York after the company posted a 10% drop in first-quarter U.S. auto sales, as the pandemic hurt demand and halted production from mid-March. The company, however, did not break out sales by month.
General Motors reported its first-quarter sales fell 7% because of significant declines in March, and said customers can use its existing ""Shop.Click.Drive."" program to find, purchase and arrange for home delivery of a vehicle.
A GM spokeswoman said across the Chevrolet, Buick, GMC and Cadillac brands the automaker has seen two to four times greater online site visits and sales leads than before the pandemic.
 Hyundai Motor  Co (KS:005380) said earlier that its U.S. sales fell 43% in March due to the pandemic. 
""It goes without saying that the entire world is facing a tremendous challenge that is having a significant impact on business and our normal way of life,"" Randy Parker, vice president for sales at Hyundai Motor America, said in a statement.
ONLINE PURCHASES
Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203) said its sales were down nearly 37% in March and 8.8% for the quarter. Nissan Motor Co Ltd (T:7201) reported a 27% drop in first-quarter sales.
FCA said its ""Drive Forward program"" allows customers to complete the entire vehicle purchase process online.
The system allows consumers to buy vehicles off dealer lots, trade in their old vehicle and apply for a car loan, FCA said.
The company also said that as of April 1 customers can take advantage of 0% interest loans for 84 months and make no payments for 90 days on select 2019 and 2020 model vehicles.

Fiat said momentum in the first two months of the year was offset as the virus hit the economy in March. Its Ram pickup trucks were a bright spot as their sales rose 7% versus the first quarter of 2019.

25,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 01, 2020 01:45PM ET</span>",Democrats urge U.S. Treasury not to delay $25 billion in grants to airlines,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi urged the U.S. Treasury on Wednesday not to hold up $25 billion in cash grants approved by Congress last week to airlines for payroll costs.
""We do want them to honor what our conversation was, which is this is just a stopping-off point for the check. It goes to the airline and directly to the employee,"" Pelosi told reporters on a conference call. ""We just don't want to hold it up.""
Major aviation unions and some airline officials are concerned the U.S. Treasury will demand too much in warrants or equity as a condition of the grants for airline payroll costs.
Treasury on Monday told airlines to propose financial instruments as part of their applications for grants that they want to see by Friday. Treasury did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Wednesday.
The legislation requires equity, warrants or other financial compensation for taxpayers for the $25 billion in loans, but gives Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin discretion over whether to seek compensation for the grants. 
Representative Peter DeFazio, who chairs the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, said on the call that Mnuchin should opt for ""something reasonable"" on grants.
""If Mnuchin wants to condition those (loans) more, fine -- take your pound of flesh. But don't slow down the payroll assistance, which is what he is in the process of doing right now,"" DeFazio said.
A group of unions representing more than 100,000 flight attendants urged Mnuchin in a letter on Wednesday not to exercise his authority to demand warrants or equity as a condition for the $25 billion in grants.
""If the airlines were required to pay back the grants in full with an equity position of $25 billion, that would give the government the equivalent of a 40% stake in airlines in exchange for keeping workers on the payroll for six months,"" the letter said, adding it ""effectively renders the payroll grants a poison pill that will cost us our jobs.""
Pelosi said Democrats agreed that ""taxpayers should get a good return on (their) loans to the airlines.""
American Airlines (O:AAL) has said it expects to be eligible for $12 billion of the $50 billion in loans and grants.

30,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 01, 2020 01:10PM ET</span>",WarnerMedia taps ex-Hulu chief Jason Kilar as CEO,"By Helen Coster
(Reuters) - AT&T Inc (N:T) on Wednesday named Jason Kilar, former head of video streaming platform Hulu, as chief executive officer of its WarnerMedia unit starting in May, when it plans to launch its HBO Max service to compete with streaming heavyweights Netflix and Disney+.
Kilar will report to AT&T Chief Operating Officer John Stankey, the company said https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200401005550/en. 
Kilar was recruited from Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) to be the founding chief executive of Hulu from 2007 until 2013. His focus on the user experience at Hulu was credited as a main reason for the service's early success. 
The move is significant because AT&T chose to hire externally rather than tap one of its own executives. Jeff Zucker, CNN president who runs all news and sports at WarnerMedia, had been seen as a potential candidate. 
The company is betting heavily on its forthcoming streaming service, HBO Max, which will compete against rivals Netflix Inc (O:NFLX) and Walt  Disney  Co's (N:DIS) Disney+. 
Kilar replaces John Stankey, who in October became AT&T COO while continuing to run WarnerMedia. Stankey has been seen as heir apparent to AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson.

PARIS/BERLIN (Reuters) - Uber Eats (N:UBER) and Delivery Hero (DE:DHER) are expanding from providing restaurant meals into supplying groceries to customers stuck at home during lockdowns triggered by the coronavirus crisis.
Uber Eats said on Wednesday it is teaming up with French supermarket group  Carrefour  (PA:CARR) for a new delivery service aimed at helping Parisians buy essential goods and food, and also has similar plans in Spain and Brazil.
Berlin-based online marketplace Delivery Hero has also made changes to its operations spanning more than 40 countries to help get groceries to customers.
Supermarkets remain open in France and elsewhere, though many have restricted the number of shoppers who can enter for safety reasons, while many customers are staying home to avoid catching or spreading infection. 
Carrefour and Uber Eats' new service will start with around 15 stores in Paris and the surrounding region on April 6, before being rolled out nationwide. It allow users to choose a Carrefour convenience store on the Uber Eats app or website.
They can also order products by phone from 11am to 11pm, including everyday grocery shopping as well as hygiene and cleaning products. Customers will also be able to get deliveries at home within 30 minutes on average.
Uber Eats will waive delivery fees on all Carrefour orders during the month of April.
Carrefour had already been exploring options of this kind before the coronavirus crisis, as supermarket groups face competition from the likes of Amazon (O:AMZN). 
Last year, it partnered with Spanish start-up Glovo to provide a fast home delivery services and collaborates with Delivery Hero in Taiwan, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Bahrain, Argentina, Chile and Uruguay. 
FAST DELIVERY
In addition to supplying prepared meals, Delivery Hero has set up more than 50 ""dark stores"" internationally to exploit its warehouse capacity and network of riders to help address increased demand for cupboard staples.
""They are optimized for a very fast delivery of day-to-day goods,"" Johannes Langguth, senior director, finance systems at Delivery Hero, told Reuters. 
The aim is to deliver in less than 20 minutes, faster than restaurant meals because no time is needed for cooking, he added.
In addition to Carrefour, it also works with other supermarkets to deliver groceries, such as with ICA in Sweden and Walmart (N:WMT) in Argentina.
In Britain, Deliveroo announced two services last month to help people who are self-isolating because of the coronavirus - the first supplying essentials, such as tinned goods, pasta and household items, and the second, a tie-up with Marks & Spencer's (L:MKS) stores on  BP  (L:BP) forecourts.
Goods such as toilet paper and tissues or tinned tuna are also available for delivery via Deliveroo from Casino-owned Franprix stores in Paris. 
For Uber, the grocery delivery operation could help cushion its business against the reduced demand for car rides.
In Spain, Uber Eats said it was partnering with Galp, an energy and gas station group, to provide home deliveries of cleaning products and toiletries from its convenience stores.

In Brazil, Uber Eats will also work with pharmacies, convenience stores and pet shops to get supplies flowing.

38,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 01, 2020 11:54AM ET</span>",A $66 Billion ETF Haul Worries Bulls Looking for Signs of Bottom,"(Bloomberg) -- During the furious sell-off in stocks last quarter, ETF investors piled into equity funds. That’s troubling to bulls looking for an end to the rout.
Exchange-traded funds lured $66.3 billion during the first three months of the year even as the S&P 500 plunged as much as 34% from its record on the way to the worst quarter since 2008. The haul was about $8 billion more than what ETFs attracted in the same period a year ago, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Equity funds led the inflows, with a $41.8 billion intake. Fixed-income products added $11.8 billion.
After $5 trillion in value was wiped from U.S. stocks this year, Wall Street has become obsessed with finding an end to the rout. For bulls, a key prerequisite for a bottom is when retail investors find the losses too big to bear. While the biggest ETF that tracks the S&P 500 did see outflows, a mom-and-pop darling, the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF, lured $18.7 billion.
“It tells me that investors are still trying to pick a bottom,” said Matt Maley, equity strategist at Miller Tabak & Co. “Bear markets usually don’t bottom-out until most investors throw-in the towel, so this news concerns me.”
Vanguard Tops 1st Qtr ETF Inflows;  State Street  (NYSE:STT) Most Outflows
While VOO was clearly a big winner as retail investors are often the last ones to bail, a peer fund -- SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust, or SPY (NYSE:SPY) -- lost $19.6 billion in that period. The $235 billion ETF is normally targeted by traders due to its high liquidity.
Another reason that could also explain the big intake for the ETF industry in the first quarter was the rush to fixed-income products. Those funds are normally seen as safer alternatives during challenging economic times.

39,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 01, 2020 11:36AM ET</span>",Stocks - Wall Street Lower After Trump Warning of Painful Weeks,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets recouped some early losses, but remained lower Tuesday morning as the market digested President Donald Trump’s warning that hundreds of thousands of Americans may die of the Covid-19 coronavirus.
Trump’s radical shift away from earlier assurances that the U.S. would soon have the virus under control came as the number of confirmed cases in the country topped 189,000, more than double those reported by China. The outbreak’s rapid spread puts huge question marks over when  economic life in the U.S. will return to normal.
By 11:30 AM ET (1530 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 634 points, or 2.9%. The S&P 500 was down 3.1% and the NASDAQ Composite was down 2.4%.
The Dow endured its worst quarter since 2008 in the three months to March, falling 23.2%. The S&P 500 fell 20% and the Nasdaq fell 14.2%.
Looking to economic data, the ISM manufacturing index fell less than expected, but with the caveat that respondents would have weighed in any time during March, so the complete Covid-19 impact wouldn't have been captured. Earlier, ADP’s private payrolls report for March failed to add much to existing knowledge, covering only the period up until March 12, that is, before the record rise in initial jobless claims last week.
Howard Marks, co-charman of Oaktree Capital, said in a letter to clients on Tuesday that although asset prices had obviously responded to the threat of the virus, still weren’t reflecting the potential for worse news flow. He added that he still expects asset prices to fall.
Marks noted that the immediate danger to health and life distinguished the current crisis from the last one in 2008.
“Social isolation, disease and death, economic contraction, enormous reliance on government action and uncertainty about the long-term effects are all with us, and the main questions surround how far they will go,” Marks wrote.
The travel sector was again in focus, after the International Air Travel Association warned that most airlines would run out of money within two to three months if the current situation continued.
Delta Air Lines  (NYSE:DAL) stock was down 13% while American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) stock was down 8.5%. United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) stock was down 11.5% while Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) stock was down a relatively modest 7.1%.
Another travel company in the spotlight is cruise operator Carnival (NYSE:CCL), which is hoping to price a capital raising of $6 billion split three ways between senior debt ($3 billion), convertible notes ($1.75 billion) and new stock ($1.25 billion).
Carnival stock was down 18% while rival  Royal Caribbean  Cruises stock (NYSE:RCL) stock was down 12%.
Elsewhere, Zoom Video (NASDAQ:ZM) stock was down 4.6% as some investors took their chips off the table in the wake of reports that New York attorney-general Letitia James is looking into its data privacy policy. Recent reports suggested that Zoom is forwarding customers’ data to Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), even when they don’t have a Facebook account."

The Cincinnati, Ohio-based company's shares rose about 5% after the supermarket chain also maintained its forecast for the year, especially when most of its rivals have scrapped their estimates due to the virus-related uncertainty. 
Kroger, however, said it was being conservative about its expectations due to a fluid environment caused by the outbreak.
""It is too early to speculate what will emerge as the 'new normal' in food consumption at home or what the impact on sales will be in future periods,"" Kroger said.
The pandemic, which has killed nearly 4,000 in the United States, has led to panic buying, with several people thronging stores to stock up on canned foods and everyday essentials. 
""After experiencing strong sales in February, the COVID-19 pandemic triggered a significantly greater lift in sales across both physical retail stores and digital channels in March,"" Chief Executive Officer Rodney McMullen said in a statement.
McMullen said sales in March tapered towards the end of the month, but remained higher than normal, as customers adjusted to the new dining, work and travel restrictions.
The company said it expects first-quarter profit to exceed its prior forecast and that it would stop additional share buybacks in the quarter.
Kroger said it also raised wages for hourly staff by $2 an hour until April 18. The average hourly wage for Kroger employees is $15 per hour.

It had preciously announced a one-time bonus for its frontline associates, payable on April 3.

(Reuters) - The Dow Jones tumbled more than 700 points on Wednesday as investors fled to safe-haven assets after new orders for U.S.-made goods plunged to an 11-year low and private payrolls fell for the first time since 2017. 
The blue-chip Dow and the S&P 500 ended Tuesday with their worst opening quarters in history as efforts to contain the virus resulted in deserted shopping streets, massive staff furloughs and a halt in business activity.
Meanwhile, the collapse in oil prices brought about its first major casualty with Whiting Petroleum (N:WLL) filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Its shares slumped 42%.
""There is no easy way to quantify either the economic shutdown or what the eventual recovery is going to look like as the monetary and fiscal policy initiatives are as historic as the economic decline,"" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities in New York.
Companies on the benchmark index have lost more than $5.6 trillion in market value so far this year, despite trillions of dollars in fiscal and monetary stimulus that helped equity markets claw back some of the sharp declines last week.
On Tuesday, U.S. President Donald Trump warned Americans of a ""painful"" two weeks ahead, with White House health officials modeling an enormous jump in virus-related deaths even with strict social distancing measures.
U.S. real estate <.SPLRCR>, utilties (SPLRCU) and consumer staples (SPLRCS) stocks, which had held up so far as they are considered stable during times of extreme volatility, fell between 1% and 6.7%.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) now expects sequential real U.S. GDP to plummet 34% in the second quarter on an annualized basis, foreshadowing a deep economic slump.
""Talk of a bottom in equity markets still seems remarkably premature given the continued increase in infection and death rates across Europe and the United States,"" said Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets in London.
With the quarterly reporting season set to begin in two weeks, S&P 500 companies are expected to enter an earnings recession in 2020, falling 3.7% in the first quarter and 9.6% in the second.
At 9:56 a.m. ET the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) was down 658.21 points, or 3.00%, at 21,258.95, the S&P 500 (SPX) was down 82.63 points, or 3.20%, at 2,501.96 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) was down 213.20 points, or 2.77%, at 7,486.90.
Interest-rate sensitive stocks on the banking index <.SPXBK> fell 5%, while airlines, hotels and cruise operators shed between 5% and 7%.
The energy sector (SPNY) shed another 3%, with experts now saying oil prices could touch single digits, exacerbated by a share tussle among top producers as the world runs out of storage space.

42,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 01, 2020 10:41AM ET</span>","Coronavirus halts recovery in Brazil real estate market, dashes IPO plans","By Gabriela Mello and Carolina Mandl
SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Just weeks ago, cement mixers, cranes, bulldozers and workers swarming around at least four different high-end residential and commercial building projects clogged a narrow street adjoining Sao Paulo's main business thoroughfare, Faria Lima.
One of several thriving construction corridors in Brazil's largest city, the bustling activity - together with a long queue of companies seeking IPOs to raise around 10 billion reais ($1.97 billion) - seemed to indicate that the country's long-depressed real estate market was finally back.
While work continues at many of those sites on streets suddenly emptied by coronavirus-related quarantine, the dozen planned stock flotations have all been canceled or postponed.
Shares of Mitre Realty Empreendimentos SA (SA:MTRE3), which early in February became the first developer in more than 10 years to list shares on the Sao Paulo stock exchange, have since sunk 43%, even steeper than the 35% drop in the benchmark Bovespa stock index (BVSP).
""If you look at the stock market now you see investors selling off to protect themselves from uncertainties, so it is not a good time for initial public offerings,"" said Luiz Antonio França, president at the Brazilian association of Real Estate Developers (Abrainc).
Construction plays a crucial role in Brazil's economy, accounting for roughly 4% of GDP and more than 5% of formal jobs. But like Latin America's largest economy as a whole, it has tended to swing from boom to bust, struggling to emerge from a painful recession that hit the country starting in 2014.
During the sector's last crisis, marked by record delinquencies, sales cancellations and sky-high borrowing costs, two listed property developers sought bankruptcy protection and others had to restructure.
Now, even with interest rates at a record-low level of 3.75%, which would normally encourage housing loans, Brazilians are likely to postpone the purchase of properties amid warnings of looming unemployment as companies are forced to suspend activities and shut factories, industry observers say.
""The real estate market is usually a haven in times of crisis, but sales cancellations or postponements can happen if unemployment rises,"" said Basilio Jafet, president of the housing union Secovi in Sao Paulo, Brazil's business hub.
About a month ago, Secovi had estimated a 10% rise in new home sales this year in Sao Paulo city amid expectations of economic reforms.
But despite homebuilders' efforts to keep sales going through online channels, even as the quarantine shutters brokerage offices and project showrooms, those numbers are likely to be cut after the coronavirus outbreak.
According to Health Ministry, Brazil had 5,717 confirmed cases and 201 deaths as of Tuesday.
""It was such a perfect scenario for real estate - low interest rates, economic activity rebounding and sales starting to pick up,"" said Guilherme B. Netto, partner at RBR Asset Management, which specializes in real estate assets. ""Now everything's uncertain."" 
CONSTRUCTION SITES OPEN, NEW PROJECTS AT RISK
Despite lockdowns and disruptions in transportation, construction sites are functioning and homebuilders intend to keep them open as workers are mainly outdoors.
A rotation scheme for lunch breaks has also been adopted to reduce the risk of contagion, Jafet added. 
""We are the locomotive, so if we stop, the wagons will also stop,"" said José Carlos Martins, president of the Brazilian Chamber of Construction Industry, adding that 62 other sectors such as retail are impacted by construction. 
While ongoing projects are on track, uncertainty regarding the crisis' duration may put new ventures at risk.
""We are not going to launch anything new the way things are,"" Raphael Horn, co-chairman of Cyrela Brazil Realty SA (SA:CYRE3), told investors on a recent conference call.
Unemployment, expected to skyrocket after the coronavirus outbreak, is the biggest looming concern, said asset manager Gabriel Trebilcock, at Sao Paulo-based Ace Capital. ""Low interest rates are important for the sector, but it is not all. Unemployment rate should go down to boost sales.""
Still, the industry remains cautiously optimistic, pointing to signs of hope from the virus' initial epicenter.
""China has managed to control the virus, so we can only hope the rest of the world will do so too and our sector surely recovers as fast as it tumbled,"" said the real estate developers group's França.
Others are still striving to maintain the schedule of new projects for as long as possible. 
""For now, we've chosen to launch the new projects planned for March and April too,"" Eduardo Fischer, co-chief executive officer of MRV Engenharia e Participacoes SA (SA:MRVE3), Latin America's largest low-income homebuilder, told Reuters in a phone interview. 
""But at moments like this, a Monday decision may not last until Tuesday.""

LONDON (Reuters) - As the novel coronavirus continues to spread, commercial flights have all but stopped. The situation is so dire that the head of the trade group representing the world's airlines called the last few months ""its deepest crisis ever.""
A Reuters analysis of data from FlightAware, which tracks air traffic in real-time, reveals a series of sequential and precipitous declines in flights in four key regions as officials sought to contain the outbreak.
From March 24 to March 30, FlightAware tracked about 280,000 flights, down almost 500,000 from the same week a year earlier.
In late March, the International Air Transport Association estimated lost revenue from the coronavirus will exceed $250 billion in 2020 and urged governments to offer immediate financial support to the industry.
The transport association said today's crisis is far worse and more widespread than after 9/11, when U.S. airlines lost approximately $19.6 billion in revenue in 2001-2002. After the terrorist attacks, the U.S. government provided $15 billion to airlines in compensation and loan guarantees.
""Airlines are desperately trying to survive in the most difficult times imaginable,"" said Alexandre de Juniac, head of the IATA. ""We have the people and the experience to see this through. But, to be perfectly frank, we don’t have the money.""
Congress voted on March 27 to give the U.S. aviation industry $58 billion in a coronavirus rescue package, and Singapore Airlines lined up a $13 billion funding package led by state investor and majority stakeholder Temasek.
GRAPHIC: The toll on travel - https://graphics.reuters.com/HEALTH-CORONAVIRUS/FLIGHTS/qzjvqeqrvxm/index.html 
AIRLINES LIMIT FLIGHTS
Because of travel restrictions enacted by governments around the world, the number of airlines grounding most or all of their fleets has grown rapidly over the past few weeks.
To account for day-to-day changes in the number of flights on weekends versus weekdays, Reuters measured change in air travel based on the same day a year prior.
In the Middle East, major carriers including Emirates, Flydubai and Saudia, Saudi Arabia's state airline, suspended all passenger flights. Israel's El Al slashed its flight schedule, and Turkish Airlines suspended all international flights on March 27.
In Asia, Singapore Airlines grounded most of its fleet on March 23 after the city-state banned all short-term visitors, and Qantas suspended international flights until at least May after the Australian government banned the arrival of non-citizens and non-residents.
In Europe, passenger data from the region's Airports Council International reveals an even deeper industry crisis than air traffic statistics indicate. As of March 22, the number of passengers traveling into and out of European airports had declined by 88%, or 5.2 million fewer daily travelers compared to a year earlier.
In Italy, containment efforts to staunch the spread of the virus triggered a rapid drop. There, data shows a 98% decline in passenger travel, or 440,000 fewer daily passengers compared to the same time last year.
Budget airlines Ryanair and easyJet (LON:EZJ) grounded most of their fleets in late March. 
U.K. CLOSES WINDOW
The number of passengers arriving to and departing from British airports has also declined, though at a slower pace than elsewhere in Europe. As of March 22, data shows passenger traffic down 82% from the same time last year.
One reason for the difference: The UK was originally exempt from the U.S. travel ban on foreign nationals who had recently visited China, Iran and a group of 14 European countries, said Michael Stanton-Geddes, head of economics at ACI-Europe.
The exemption ""temporarily protected a lot of transatlantic traffic,"" he said. ""People getting from Europe to the U.S. had to go through London.""
As of mid-March, some vacationers were still leaving the UK for European destinations. On March 14, Jet2 turned around flights bound for Spain after the airline canceled all flights to the mainland.
In China, air traffic is starting to pick back up after two months of severe travel restrictions. The country saw a half million fewer flights during the same two-month period compared to the same period a year ago.
A TURBULENT TIME
The drop in flights in the United States following the Trump administration's travel restrictions mirrors the drop in air traffic around the world.
Data from FlightAware shows just 866 international flights arrived in or departed from the United States on March 30, a drop of 83% compared to the same day a year ago. Flights involving private business jets and turboprop planes were also down 67% in the U.S. and 64% worldwide, the data shows. 
The number of domestic flights has been less affected than international flights, however. Daily flights within the United States were down 51% on Monday compared to a year prior, according to FlightAware data.
But many of those flights have far fewer passengers. Planes are only 10-20% full, industry lobby Airlines for America said in late March.
CARGO SUPPLANTS PASSENGERS
So far, the number of cargo flights has remained largely unaffected by the travel restrictions. 
Data from FlightAware shows flights by freight and package carriers such as Atlas, Polar, FedEx (NYSE:FDX) and UPS arriving in and departing from the United States initially declined during the first week of February 2020. The drop, which correlated to the Hubei Province lockdown, ""shows how important China is to the world of international commerce,"" said Andrew Charlton, an industry analyst.
Shortly thereafter, however, U.S. cargo flights rebounded to previous levels, the data shows. 

Because passenger jets transport about half of all air cargo carried worldwide, the grounding of those planes has increased demand for freighters. In response, some commercial airlines such as American, Delta and Virgin Atlantic are using passenger jets solely for shipping cargo.

BERLIN/MUNICH (Reuters) - The German government stands ready to take over Condor as a deal for the airline to be bought by Polish rival LOT is likely to collapse in the industry turmoil caused by the coronavirus crisis, several people familiar with the matter told Reuters.
LOT agreed in January to buy Condor for about 300 million euros ($328 million) to create a leading European aviation group with more than 20 million passengers a year.
But with planes unable to fly because of travel restrictions, compounded by a plunge in demand over fears of contagion, airlines worldwide have grounded most of their fleets, and many have said they need government support to survive.
Last week, airlines urged governments to speed up bailouts to rescue the air transport industry, as they doubled their estimate of 2020 revenue losses from the health crisis to more than $250 billion.
LOT owner PGL has made completion of its takeover deal contingent on certain financial guarantees that the German government considers unacceptable, the sources said, adding no final decision on Condor's immediate future had been taken.
""LOT has some issues with the deal financing"", one of the people said, while another said a government decision could come as early as this week.
Condor said it was in talks with all parties involved and no decision had been made yet, declining to comment further. PGL and the German economy ministry declined to comment.
Nationalising Condor would only be for a limited time as Germany aims to restart a sales process as soon as the stranglehold on the travel industry from the coronavirus pandemic has eased, the sources said.
Condor is a former unit of Thomas Cook, the holiday company that collapsed in September. A 380 million euro ($415 million) state bridging loan allowed the carrier to be rescued. 
Last week, Condor applied for an additional 200 million euros in state aid in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak, according to people familiar with the matter.

48,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 01, 2020 08:45AM ET</span>",Even Wall Street’s Bottom-Fishers Won’t Go Near Emerging Markets,"(Bloomberg) -- Emerging markets have just taken a first-quarter battering. The fear on Wall Street is that it may hardly compare with what’s coming.
While the advanced economies have gone into lockdown to contain the spread of Covid-19, triggering market turmoil of a kind unseen in generations, the world’s developing nations have yet to experience the full effects, both economic and humanitarian, of the pandemic. True, the global dollar squeeze, collapse in commodity prices and rising distressed-debt levels have prompted pre-emptive stimulus measures across many countries, but the success or failure of these is likely to remain unknown for a while yet.
Little wonder then that some of the world’s foremost investors and strategists, from  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). to JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co. and Franklin Templeton are telling clients to hold off on bargain hunting. They’re worried the coronavirus could devastate nations such as India, South Africa and Brazil, where infections are only now starting to gather pace.
“Markets are discounting a catastrophic recession accompanied by massive defaults,” said Ricardo Hausmann, an economist at Harvard University. “As horrific as this sounds, the situation in the advanced economies is likely to be much more benign than what developing countries are facing. Not only in terms of the disease burden, but also in terms of the economic devastation.”
Emerging markets are traditionally thought of as volatile, and perhaps it’s no surprise that their assets generally came off worse than their counterparts in the advanced economies of the U.S., Europe and Japan. But while banks such as JPMorgan and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) say developed-nation stocks have probably bottomed already, that’s not the case for developing countries.
Equity markets in the developing world just capped their worst quarter since the 2008 financial crisis. Currencies tumbled as demand for U.S. dollars soared, led by a depreciation of more than 20% in the Brazilian real, South African rand and Russian ruble. A broad gauge of dollar bonds from emerging markets posted its sharpest sell-off since 1998.
With emerging economies reeling from a slump in demand for commodities such as oil and metals, supply-chain disruptions and dollar-debt burdens exacerbated by weakening currencies, outflows are likely to surge in the next few quarters, according to a JPMorgan model.
“It’s unlikely this crisis is over as it moves from an acute to a chronic phase,” Luis Oganes, a London-based strategist at JPMorgan, wrote in a report. “Focus will turn to emerging-market country vulnerabilities over the coming months as capital outflows could mutate into a sudden stop.”
Hausmann and Oganes may be gloomy, but they’re in good company. In fact, a “Who’s Who” of economists and investors, including Mohamed El-Erian, Michael Hasenstab and Carmen Reinhart, are also sounding the alarm.
El-Erian, the chief economic adviser at Allianz (DE:ALVG) SE and a Bloomberg Opinion contributor, said the current situation has elements of both the Great Depression and the 2008 financial crisis. While fiscal stimulus in the developed world has helped for now, investors need to eschew risk, he said. El-Erian advised selling lower-rated bonds, adjusting stock portfolios to favor companies with strong balance sheets and keeping more cash on hand for distressed opportunities down the road.
Hasenstab, Templeton’s chief investment officer for global macro, agrees. He says it’s “too early” to try to cherry pick among distressed securities. His team favors so-called haven assets, while increasing allocations to cash and several higher-yielding emerging markets with more resilient economies.
Gundlach Says ‘En Masse’ Defaults Likely for Some Junk Issuers
The list of developing nations seeking debt relief has already swelled in the past few months. Fifteen nations with more than $100 billion of Eurobonds outstanding had average spreads of at least 1,000 basis points over U.S. Treasuries as of March 19, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Argentina is pursuing a restructuring, Ecuador is discussing a re-profiling and Zambia is seeking to reorganize its foreign bonds. Meantime, Lebanon defaulted in March on its first bond since independence in 1943.
Another challenge is that China, a lender of last resort for many developing nations, is experiencing its own slowdown. Reinhart, an economist at Harvard University, warns that the world’s second-largest economy may contract this year for the first time since 1976, reducing Beijing’s lending capacity. Even Chinese officials have cautioned the road back will be a long one.
The potential human misery as the coronavirus rips through developing nations even less equipped to cope with a pandemic than their advanced counterparts is what worries investors most. The stricter the rules imposed to curb contagion, the more those countries will be forced to boost spending, in turn compelling them to borrow more. That chain of events will disproportionately hurt the weakest credits, many of them commodity producers already suffering from a collapse in exports as well as a drop off in remittances, according to Hausmann.
Nouriel Roubini, a professor at New York University who predicted hard times before the global financial crisis in 2008, says money printing will flourish, with Mexican pesos, Indonesian rupiahs and Turkish liras about to spill forth from central banks.
“How do you avoid a freefall of their currencies?” he asked.
The consequences could be even worse in countries with poor policy responses or local dynamics that make the virus harder to contain, according to Fabiana Fedeli, the global head of fundamental equities at Robeco in Rotterdam. She singled out Brazil and Mexico for their lackluster efforts to fight the spread of the disease, and India because of its crowded slums.
‘We Will Starve Here’: India’s Poor Flee Cities in Mass Exodus
The International Monetary Fund and World Bank have committed some $1 trillion in lending capacity to nations hamstrung by the pandemic, yet Roubini estimates the need may be three or four times that amount.
Kamakshya Trivedi, a strategist at Goldman Sachs in London, says bonds in developing economies look more vulnerable now than they did during the 2008 financial crisis.
“We see further downside risks across emerging-market assets as the global economic outlook remains fragile and is consistently shifting,” he wrote in a report.

49,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 01, 2020 08:40AM ET</span>",Income funds sift for survivors as coronavirus cuts into dividends,"By Simon Jessop, Milla Nissi and Sarah Morland
LONDON/GDANSK (Reuters) - As companies cut dividends in response to the financial havoc caused by the coronavirus, fund managers whose portfolios rely on the payouts are sifting for those most likely to deliver a sustainable yield when the world recovers.
Nearly 70 of the top 600 listed companies in Europe cut or suspended dividends between Feb. 24 and March 31, a Reuters analysis found, while 18 of the top 100 London-listed companies have cut or delayed theirs. 
By March 30, 12 S&P500 (SPX) firms had reduced or suspended their dividends, according to Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS). 
The latest to rip up dividend plans include some of Europe's top banks, such as HSBC (L:HSBA) and Lloyds Banking Group (L:LLOY), after pressure from regulators. Globally, the roll call of dividend-cutting companies straddles sectors, from aircraft maker Boeing (N:BA) to automaker Ford Motor Company (N:F), and advertising giant WPP (L:WPP). 
The pressure is also growing on other leading dividend payers, notably in the energy sector, whose earnings are being hit by deep oil price falls as coronavirus lockdowns destroy demand and supplies swell. [O/R]
""Companies can plan for a recession - it's tough but provisions can be made. However, this environment is much more extreme with many businesses facing prolonged periods without revenue,"" said Ben Whitmore, who runs several funds at Jupiter Asset Management, including the Jupiter Income Trust.
""We have stress-tested the portfolio and made some sales of businesses where the balance sheet can't cope with this stress.""
The wave of dividend cuts raises a question mark over mutual funds whose entire strategy is based on harvesting income streams to pay their clients and is an increasingly popular play with retail investors seeking a steady stream of returns.
Between 2018 and 2019, European-based global income funds saw their assets rise by 21% to 90.2 billion euros ($99.25 billion), data from Morningstar showed.
For now, income fund managers say all they can do is focus on companies that may still need to cut payouts to preserve cash in the short run, but are likely to weather the expected sharp downturn.
""For our portfolio, the key at the moment is the protection of capital and ensuring that the fund is best placed for when we come out of the tunnel. Being in a strong position for capital growth will mean the medium-term position for income will be strong,"" Chris Murphy, manager of the  Aviva  (LON:AV) Investors UK Equity Income Fund, said. 
He said he had added to positions in insurer  Prudential  (L:PRU) and money manager  Schroders  (L:SDR).

There are signs income funds are feeling the strain more than others. By March 25, the value of assets in British dividend funds - which totalled around 43 billion pounds ($53.16 billion) at the start of the month - had fallen by an average 30.2%, against 25.3% for the FTSE All Share according to data from Morningstar, although to-date, there have been no fund closures.
European dividend futures show markets pricing in a 45% cut to dividends in 2020 with a further significant fall in 2021, Nicolas Simar, Senior Portfolio Manager Euro & European High Dividend, said.
""This seems overdone to us,"" Simar said. ""As a comparison, dividends fell around 30% in Europe during the great financial crisis (of 2007-8), and for an average recession, the figure is about 10%.
""While there is not much that is average about the current situation, it's not obvious to us that the end point, from a dividend perspective, should be half again as bad as the 2008 crisis.""
Refinitiv data shows analysts expect STOXX Europe 600 dividend payouts to fall by around $10 billion over the next 12 months.
Graphic: Analysts see $10 billion in dividend cuts for Europe, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/buzz/oakveqmlvrd/Pasted%20image%201585657663923.png
In the United States, Goldman Sachs analysts said they expected ""a wave of dividend suspensions, cuts, and eliminations"" to drive down dividends by 38% over the next nine months, for a full-year slide of 25% below last year's payout level.
Matthew Jennings, Equity Income Investment Director at Fidelity International, said the unique circumstances surrounding this round of dividend cuts should offer some solace to investors, especially if a temporary conservation of cash ensures a stronger recovery. 
With an estimated one-third of the world's population in lockdown, and political pressure building in some countries for companies to show restraint, it was vital to work out which companies had suffered a long-term hit to value, he said.
""A dividend cut in normal circumstances can be a signal of a business that has been poorly managed or is in structural decline. However, this is not necessarily the case today,"" Jennings said, adding the firm backed the deferral of bank sector dividends.

""We have no automatic knee-jerk reaction to a dividend cut in the portfolio. In many cases a dividend cut today will be in the long-term interests of shareholders and aid a speedy recovery on the other side of the pandemic.""

51,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 01, 2020 07:10AM ET</span>",U.S. small businesses wait impatiently for government aid that could be slow to come,"By David Henry, Heather Timmons and Elizabeth Dilts Marshall
NEW YORK/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - As soon as New York officials began detailing their response to the coronavirus, Matt Preis knew his staff might be in trouble.
His Brooklyn-based pet company Chuck & Buddha's cares for animals while their owners work or travel. But as his customers suddenly found themselves at home under government orders, business dried up.
""I have never seen anything like this in my lifetime,"" said Preis, who employs three full-time workers and several others part-time. ""Even the downturn in 2008 didn't affect independent dog walkers too much, except there were a lot more of us all of a sudden.""
Like many other small-business owners who spoke to Reuters, Preis is hoping new government programs might keep him afloat.
But the application process can be confusing, with local, state and federal programs touting initiatives that do not immediately offer much-needed access to cash. And while the federal government wants to disperse funds quickly, logistical hurdles - including a lack of staff to vet mountains of applications - will be hard to overcome.
Over the past few days, Preis has contacted relevant agencies, his bank and financial advisers. As of Tuesday afternoon, he had been given just two hyperlinks and was working on applications. 
""I don't know what the future holds for many small companies, which include our mom-and-pop dog-walking operation,"" Preis said.
Seeking to help millions of business owners who have seen their operations either shut down or dramatically curtailed by the coronavirus pandemic, Congress last week passed a $2 trillion stimulus package that includes $349 billion aimed at small firms through the Payroll Protection Program.
It covers eight weeks of payroll and some other operating expenses through a forgivable loan of up to $10 million for businesses that have roughly 500 or fewer employees.
The program is retroactive from Feb. 15 so employers who laid off workers can re-hire them through June 30, according to guidance provided by the Treasury Department on Tuesday. It appears to offer broad coverage, including for self-employed individuals, independent contractors, non-profits, military-veteran organizations and tribal groups.
""Speed is the operative word,"" Jovita Carranza, administrator of the Small Business Administration (SBA), said in a statement. The SBA is the main agency through which money will flow from the Treasury Department.
But for many owners, relief may not come quick enough - their revenues and supplies gutted after many local and state governments ordered business closures in mid-March. Some authorities have also expanded restrictions since then. 
Kelly Klein, CEO of Groennfell Meadery in Saint Albans, Vermont, whose business has basically shut down said she has not gotten clear information about the federal loan program, despite reading information online and talking to her banker.
Her five employees are waiting to hear if they remain employed after May.
""Without something we wouldn't be able to keep our employees,"" she said. "" My biggest goal is to keep them and of course make sure there's a business for them to come back and work for.""
EASIER SAID THAN DONE
The SBA is sure to be overwhelmed. It issued $28 billion in loans last year, and will have to process more than 10 times that amount in just three months with limited staff, sources in Washington and in the banking industry told Reuters.
Many declined to be identified as they were not authorized to speak about it.
Complicating matters, the White House wants to be the clearinghouse for all information about the coronavirus, making it hard for agencies to help banks understand the program better, people briefed on the discussions about the program said.
Lenders must verify that borrowers had specific employees on their books at the time they claim, and that their other costs are legitimate, which can take time. They must also follow requirements to prevent fraud and protect customer information under the Bank Secrecy Act.
""This is the kind of program that in ordinary times would take a year to get started,"" said Greg Baer, CEO of the Bank Policy Institute.
Banks have been telling customers to be patient and asking them to get relevant paperwork ready so that loans are processed quickly when it all comes together. Some expect cash to begin moving as soon as Friday.
Huntington Bancshares Inc (O:HBAN) CEO Stephen Steinour said he expects to have staff working seven days a week on extended shifts through the end of June and to hire outside contractors for additional support.

""There's going to be an enormous flow,"" he said.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are set to open sharply lower Wednesday, after a grim warning about the impact of the coronavirus pandemic and as the global economic damage caused by the associated shutdown ramped up.
At 6:00 AM ET (1000 GMT), futures for the S&P 500 traded 80 points, or 3.1%, lower, and futures for the Nasdaq down 219 points, or 2.8%. The Dow futures contract fell 664 points, or 3.1%, continuing the tone seen in the last quarter, the weakest three-month period in over a decade.
President Donald Trump warned Americans late Tuesday to brace for a “rough two-week period” ahead as the White House released new projections that there could be 100,000 to 240,000 deaths in the U.S. from Covid-19.
Data from Johns Hopkins University showed that the number of confirmed cases in the U.S. now totals over 189,000, a rise of 15% on the day, while New York state’s infections surged past those reported in China’s Hubei province, where the virus first emerged late last year. Fatalities in New York City, the epicenter of the U.S. outbreak, have topped 1,000, around a quarter of the overall U.S. deaths.
Earlier Wednesday, Markit's PMI data showed factory activity dropped sharply across most of Asia in March, with regional economic powerhouses Japan and South Korea posting their biggest contractions in about a decade.
In Europe, Italian manufacturing suffered a record drop in output in March, while the eurozone manufacturing PMI hit a seven-year low. 
Attention will turn to the equivalent data in the U.S., with the March manufacturing PMI release, at 10 AM ET (1400 GMT), and ADP's private payrolls release at 8:15 AM ET. These are unlikely to offer up any positive news.
Turning to corporate news, Xerox (NYSE:XRX) will be in the spotlight after it dropped its five-month hostile bid to acquire larger rival HP (NYSE:HPQ). The copier maker cited the coronavirus crisis as undermining its ability to pull off the debt-financed merger. Cruise line operator Carnival (NYSE:CCL), meanwhile, is looking to pull off a $6 billion capital raising. Carnival stock was down 6.2% in premarket.
Oil traded mixed Wednesday, with Brent hard hit as Saudi Arabia showed no sign of bowing to pressure from President Donald Trump to dial back the oil-price war with Russia, pushing crude supply to record levels. 
At 7 AM ET (1100 GMT), U.S. crude futures traded 0.7% higher at $20.62 a barrel, dipping briefly below $20 overnight. The international benchmark Brent contract fell 3% to $25.55.
Additionally, gold futures rose 0.6% to $1,606/60oz, while EUR/USD traded at $1.0939, down 0.8%."

KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - The world's biggest maker of medical gloves is grappling with a serious shortage of workers as it tries to meet a huge surge in demand as countries such as the United States run out of personal protective gear due to the coronavirus outbreak.
Malaysia's Top Glove Corp Bhd (KL:TPGC), which makes one out of every five gloves in the world, needs to urgently recruit up to 700 more workers as orders in the past few weeks have doubled, the company told Reuters on Wednesday.
It has already said it would not be able to meet all of the increased demand, and its struggle to recruit workers could make the task of quickly adding production lines even more difficult.
The hiring drive has been hampered by Malaysia's month-long curbs on travel as well difficulties in flying in workers from countries such as Nepal, the company's main source of labor.
A relatively industrialized nation of 32 million, Malaysia heavily relies on labor from South Asian countries.
""We were already experiencing a shortage of workers in the beginning of the year, which has now become more serious following the implementation of Malaysia's movement control order,"" executive chairman Lim Wee Chai said.
""At the moment, due to the surge in demand, we require unskilled workers, especially to speed up the packing function and quality assurance function, so that the ready output can be shipped out quickly to our customers.""
Despite the coronavirus restrictions that will last until mid-April, the company managed to recruit some 300 people last month and has engaged staffing firms to look for workers more aggressively. It is now trying to hire more Malaysians and is conducting interviews over WhatsApp video calls.
Top Glove has 18,000 employees and 44 factories in three countries with the capacity to make 73.8 billion gloves a year, which it wants to increase given the global shortage.
An emergency stockpile of medical equipment maintained by the U.S. government has nearly run out of protective gear including masks, respirators, gloves, gowns and face shields, Reuters reported on Tuesday citing officials.

Malaysia, the world's biggest glove producer, has the highest number of coronavirus infections in Southeast Asia with 2,908 cases.

55,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 01, 2020 06:30AM ET</span>",Exclusive: U.S. prosecutors probe former Wells Fargo executive over scandal - sources,"By Chris Prentice and Koh Gui Qing
WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. prosecutors are investigating the former head of  Wells Fargo  & Co’s (N:WFC) community banking division for her role in the lender’s product mis-selling scandal, two sources said.
The Department of Justice is investigating Carrie Tolstedt, who ran the bank's retail and small business lending business from 2007 to 2016, the sources said. The criminal inquiry into Tolstedt’s actions has not been previously reported.
The development marks a rare instance of a senior bank executive facing criminal inquiry as a result of their job. Wells Fargo, which paid $3 billion in February to settle federal civil and criminal probes, has admitted that it pressured employees between 2002 and 2016 to meet unrealistic sales goals, which led them to open fake accounts for customers.
Reuters was unable to determine whether the criminal investigation will lead to any charges against Tolstedt. Tolstedt is also contesting a $25 million fine and civil charges brought by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), a banking regulator in January. 
Tolstedt and Enu Mainigi, Tolstedt's counsel at Williams (NYSE:WMB) & Connolly LLP, did not respond to several requests for comment about the criminal inquiry. Mainigi has previously said that Tolstedt acted ""appropriately and in good faith at all times."" 
""Throughout her career, Ms. Tolstedt acted with the utmost integrity and concern for doing the right thing,” she said in January in response to the OCC’s charges. “A full and fair examination of the facts will vindicate Carrie.""
A spokesperson for Wells Fargo declined to comment. 
A spokesman for the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Central District of California, which has led the Department of Justice's Wells Fargo criminal investigation, declined to comment.
The prosecution of Wells Fargo executives who oversaw the bank’s activities is seen by lawmakers and investors as one of the final pieces of the scandal’s fallout for the bank. Wells Fargo has paid out more than $7 billion to settle multiple probes and private litigation.
Prosecutors had been probing Tolstedt as one among a short list of people with a view to bringing criminal charges, the sources said. One of the sources added that the list has narrowed to focus on Tolstedt. 
Tolstedt is the individual described as ""Executive A"" whom the Justice Department singled out in a document detailing its evidence against the San Francisco-based lender in February, one of the sources said. 
In the document, a statement of facts published alongside the deal agreed by the bank and the government prosecutors, said ""Executive A"" ran Wells Fargo's community banking division from 2007-2016 and led its strategy to sell additional products to existing customers.
""Executive A"" helped cultivate a high-pressure sales culture, in which ""onerous"" sales goals led thousands of employees to engage in unlawful and unethical conduct, they wrote. The executive also ignored repeated complaints about the practices, prosecutors wrote. 
In its charges, the OCC said Tolstedt was ""directly and significantly"" responsible for the business model that incentivized the misconduct. She invoked her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination in the civil inquiry, the OCC said in January.

56,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 01, 2020 06:20AM ET</span>",Oilfield spending to fall 21% as producers slash outlays: report,"By Liz Hampton
(Reuters) - Global spending on oilfield equipment and services this year will fall 21% from 2019 to $211 billion, the lowest level since 2005, according to a report to be released on Wednesday by consultancy Spears & Associates, as oil and gas producers slash spending.
The decline comes as the coronavirus pandemic has crushed oil and gas demand, and Saudi Arabia and Russia pump full bore in a grab for market share that has shale producers reeling. U.S. oil futures fell 54% for the month of March, to $20.48 a barrel on Tuesday, below U.S. producers' cost of production. 
Spears' estimate for 2020 spending is below industry outlays at the nadir of the last price crash in 2016, and less than half the 2014 peak of $473 billion. 
The company, which surveys oilfield firms, evaluates company reports and models sales, historically has not publicly released its data, but the severity of the drop and debate over the industry's future made it change course, an executive said. 
""It does no good for oil and gas companies, for politicians, for bankers to imagine the service sector is going to be better off,"" said Richard Spears, a managing partner of the firm. ""This is the reality."" 
Oilfield segments with the greatest share of North American revenue will see the biggest hits, with hydraulic fracturing spending down 44% from last year and land contract drilling down 29%, Spears estimated. 
(For a graphic on the falling price of oil, click here: https://reut.rs/39ieums)
Halliburton (N:HAL), the top U.S. hydraulic fracturing provider, could see its fracking revenue fall to around $4.1 billion, below $4.5 billion in 2016, and contract driller Nabors (N:NBR) could see contract land drilling fall to $1.7 billion for the year, from $1.8 billion in 2016, according to Spears. 
Overall spending on directional drilling, which helped launch the U.S. shale boom, could fall 30% over last year, and coiled tubing and artificial lift sales are expected to fall 29% and 27%, respectively. 
Manufacturers of major equipment, such as rigs, pumping trucks and tools, are expected to face a 50% decline in spending from the prior year. 
International markets will not fare as badly. Offshore contract drilling sales will dip 7% and offshore construction will fall 10% from the prior year, Spears estimates. 

The report is closely read by oilfield executives and major producers to gauge the state of the market.

57,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 01, 2020 06:09AM ET</span>",Credit Market Fueled by Firms Hoarding Cash for Earnings Slump,"(Bloomberg) -- A global debt funding bonanza is quickening as the new quarter gets underway, with firms including Tiffany buyer LVMH and Spain’s  Iberdrola  (MC:IBE) SA joining the busiest day in Europe’s bond market since January.
Seventeen borrowers are offering new debt in Europe on Wednesday, the most since Jan. 21 and adding to the more than $85 billion already raised globally this week. Companies around the world sold at least $752 billion of bonds last quarter, building up their defenses against collapsing earnings caused by the coronavirus pandemic.
“We expect issuance to continue as corporates look to bolster liquidity,” said Henrik Johnsson, co-head of capital markets at  Deutsche Bank  AG (DE:DBKGn). “The long term effect of all this debt is hard to quantify.”
Issuing debt in the current environment comes at a price, however.
The yield premium over low-risk treasury debt on euro-denominated investment-grade company bonds stands at 239 basis points, close to the highest since 2012. Average spreads on Asian high-grade dollar bonds jumped 179 basis points in the first quarter, the most ever recorded on a Bloomberg Barclays index going back to 1989.
Cruise ship operator Carnival (NYSE:CCL) Corp is offering to pay a coupon as high as 12.5% as it seeks to raise $6 billion in new debt in a deal launched on Tuesday. The sale was originally structured with a euro-denominated tranche, before the company decided to scrap the non-dollar portion.
With the virus causing devastation to the cruise ship industry, Carnival’s senior unsecured debt rating was cut two notches to Baa3 by Moody’s Investors Service overnight. S&P Global also recently lowered Carnival’s corporate ratings.
“Companies are worrying about a collapse in revenue so they need to borrow more to pay for operational expenses,” said Alicia Garcia Herrero, chief Asia-Pacific economist at Natixis SA. “The expectation of lower income and higher funding costs are pushing companies to issue more.”
Borrower binge
LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE is offering euro notes due in five years at about 155 basis points above midswaps on Wednesday. Less than two months ago, it paid less than a fifth of that for 1.25 billion euros ($1.4 billion) of six-year notes.
Absolut Vodka maker  Pernod Ricard  (PA:PERP) SA is offering euro notes due in five and 10 years, with the shorter tranche offered at 180-185 basis points above midswaps. That’s about triple what it paid to sell euro eight-year notes in October.
Massive stimulus measures from central banks and governments around the world have helped slow a broader sell-off across risk assets in recent weeks and eased credit spread widening. But risks still abound, not least for money managers who have been bargain hunting in recent days.
One indicator continuing to show serious concerns for the global economy is oil, which posted the worst quarter on record. The rout has sparked a flurry of corporate and sovereign downgrades from Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) Co. to Mexico.
“We see rising default risks given slowing growth and the collapse in energy prices,” said Charles Macgregor, head of Asia at Lucror Analytics, an independent research firm based in Singapore. The broader record bond bonanza shows “wanton investor appetite” amid all the lingering risks, he said.

58,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 01, 2020 05:51AM ET</span>",StockBeat: Can Carnival Cope?,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- Can private business survive the Coronavirus crisis without government bailouts? The answer should become clear in the course of the day as cruise line operator Carnival (LON:CCL) tries to raise $6 billion from the debt and equity markets.
Carnival’s case is interesting because it’s unable to call significantly on any government to help it. Listed in New York and London but registered in Panama, it will not be eligible for any of the economic support packages passed by the U.S. and U.K. governments. The capital raising will stand or fall entirely on the willingness of private investors to judge the outlook for long-term returns and look through its short-term troubles.
Those troubles are huge. The company has been forced to suspend all sailings after its cruise ships suffered multiple outbreaks of the fatal disease, crippling its ability to generate revenue to service its debts.
Those episodes were amplified by the concentration of vulnerable elderly passengers, the terrifying confinement of a closed environment and intense media coverage that revelled in the irony of the ‘dream turned into nightmare’ narrative.  And it still has over 6,000 passengers at sea, including on the stricken Zaandam, operated by its Holland America line.
No wonder Carnival (NYSE:CCL) stock is down over 75% since the outbreak began.
The company has $1.83 billion in debt falling due this year and $1.92 billion due next year, as well as heavy commitments to pay for new ships that – in happier times – it considered a safe bet ($2.8 billion this year and $5.9 billion in subsequent years).
The company had already drawn down its existing $3 billion credit line in mid-March. At that time, it had tried to play down the ship commitments by saying they probably wouldn’t be delivered on time anyway because the virus would also stop shipyards delivering them, which is probably true enough but unlikely to be enough reassurance in the current circumstances.
Bloomberg reported that the $3 billion senior note offering that makes up half of the capital raise is being marketed with a 12.5% coupon, despite being secured against the company’s prime operating assets, its ships, and despite having a three-year maturity.
Together with the $1.75 billion of convertibles that are being offered, and $2.2 billion in already-existing commitments, that creates a pretty steep refinancing cliff in three years’ time.
The company, at least, seems to be assuming that three years will be enough for the world to forget Covid-19 and allow it to return to its previous growth trajectory. That seems ambitious, to say the least.
The parallel with EasyJet (LON:EZJ), another leisure-focused travel company beset by heavy commitments for expanding capacity, is instructive. EasyJet founder Stelios Hagi-Ioannou threatened on Monday to sack every non-executive director at the airline, one by one, if it didn’t get out of crippling contracts to pay for new Airbus aircraft that (Sir Stelios says) it no longer needs.
Carnival’s latest regulatory announcements give no hint that it is thinking of abandoning its ship orders. There may yet be a case for investing in Carnival, but surely not without some guarantee of more realistic use of investor capital."
59,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 01, 2020 05:25AM ET</span>","Exclusive: China may ease electric car quotas, delay emission rules to help automakers - sources","By Yilei Sun and Norihiko Shirouzu
BEIJING (Reuters) - China is considering temporarily easing quotas designed to boost production of electric cars to help automakers badly bruised by the coronavirus pandemic to revive slumping sales, people familiar with the matter said.
Policymakers in the world's biggest auto market may also delay the implementation of a new emission particle restriction by six months to help the car industry, which has suffered a 79% drop in sales in February and expects a fall of around 10% in the first half of this year.
The United States had already planned to relax vehicle emissions rules. President Donald Trump's administration on Tuesday completed a rollback of vehicle emissions standards adopted under predecessor Barack Obama. This will require 1.5% annual increases in efficiency through 2026 - much weaker than the 5% increases under the previous regime.
""Policymakers acknowledged that automakers are strained to promote electric models when overall demand is slowing. They want the auto industry to recover steadily this year,"" one of the four people familiar with the matter said. 
Authorities are still reviewing the details of the plan, which has yet to be finalised, sources said, declining to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter. The review is being discussed with officials at industry and environment ministries as well as automakers and industry bodies.
The policy shift comes as Xin Guobin, vice industry minister, said on Monday that China would ""make adjustments on new energy vehicles and related policies to further promote the coordinated and healthy development of the automotive industry.""
The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Ministry of Ecology and Environment could not immediately be reached for comment.
China requires automakers doing business in the country to follow strict rules covering the production of so-called new energy vehicles (NEVs) as part of a quota system. 
China hopes NEVs, such as battery-powered electric vehicles, plug-in hybrid and hydrogen fuel-cell cars, will account for around a quarter of all cars sold in the country in 2025, up sharply from 5% in 2019.
As a result carmakers, including Tesla (O:TSLA), Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), General Motors (N:GM), Toyota (T:7203) and Geely [GEELY.UL], have increased EV production. But the system has also been criticised for offering few incentives for automakers to improve gasoline cars' efficiency.
The change in policy is largely aimed at helping automakers focus on selling more profitable gasoline cars to improve their cash flow. But a small group of companies -- mostly Chinese automakers such as BYD (SZ:002594) -- are already making money from electric vehicle sales.
The temporary easing of NEV quotas is likely to allow companies to delay new model launches, which have more costly technology than conventional vehicles, and also discourage them from aggressive marketing.
China's vice industry minister Xin said the auto industry still faced great difficulties and challenges.
""Even though production has resumed to a relatively high level, it is possible that some enterprises would cut production in the subsequent period due to insufficient market demand and increased inventories,"" he said.

To spur demand, China said late on Tuesday that it will extend subsidies for NEV purchases and extend their purchase tax exemption for two years.

60,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 01, 2020 05:15AM ET</span>",Markets fall as virus woes strike again,"By Marc Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - World markets fell on Wednesday as the coronavirus threat ensured an ugly start to the second quarter for equities and commodities.
Traders headed for the safety of government bonds, the dollar and gold as evidence continued to mount that the virus was sending the global economy into a deep recession.
Tokyo's Nikkei slumped 4.5% after the worst plunge in factory activity in almost a decade. The pan-European STOXX 600 sank 3.2% and Wall Street futures dived 3.1% after a dire forecast of likely U.S. coronavirus deaths.
""President Trump warning about two dreadful weeks ahead and 100,000 - 240,000 deaths in the coming months is definitely putting a negative tone on the market,"" said  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) strategist Kit Juckes. ""It is pretty risk-off out there. It is definitely a day of lower bonds yields, falling equity indexes and tin hats.""
Wall Street tumbled on Tuesday, capping the biggest quarterly fall since 1987 for the Dow Jones and the steepest for the S&P 500 since the financial crisis. The fact it all happened in a month and from record highs made it feel all the more brutal.
U.S. economic activity is likely to be ""very bad"" and the unemployment rate could rise above 10% because of efforts to slow the spread of the coronavirus, Cleveland Federal Reserve Bank President Loretta Mester told CNBC. 
There had been some glimmers of hope during Asian trading. China's factory activity improved in March after plunging in February. It just scraped into positive territory, beating analysts' expectations.
Blue-chip Chinese stocks failed to hold their gains, however, though Australian shares bounced 3.5% as a slowdown in new coronavirus cases there and rising iron ore prices lifted the market.
But Europe's early plunge meant MSCI's main gauge of world stocks was down nearly 1% having slumped 22% since the start of the year.
The number of coronavirus infections globally headed toward 800,000. In a positive development,  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) analysts noted the global growth in new cases was below 10% for two consecutive days, having exceeded that rate for most of the past two weeks.
Health officials were not upbeat, however. A World Health Organization official warned that even in the Asia-Pacific region, the epidemic was ""far from over.""
OIL, TOIL AND TROUBLE 
In currency markets, the dollar's safe-haven appeal saw it continue to rose. The yen held its ground, but the euro dropped back under $1.10 as traders braced for German manufacturing and European Union unemployment figures. 
The pound fell to $1.2350 and plenty of commodity-exposed currencies from the Australian dollar to the Russian rouble saw 1% losses. 
""Don't fight the Fed"" is the old adage, but markets seem to be doing their best to do that anyway – a new set of Fed FX swap lines on Tuesday was meant to reassure markets that the U.S. central bank was there to ensure an adequate supply of dollars.
""In my view, markets have still not fully priced in the damage from the coronavirus, with some people still talking about V-shaped recovery,"" said Masahiko Loo, portfolio manager at Alliance Bernstein in Tokyo.
""The U.S. and Europe are hit by the first wave now, but as you can see in Asia, there could be more waves from re-imported cases. Human psychology also does not quickly recover either after an experience like this.""
Demand for the guaranteed income of government bonds pushed the yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note down to 0.63%.
Italian bond yields also held steady as the benefit of recent European Central Bank measures meant the country - which has been one of those hit hardest by the coronavirus - successfully sold 8.5 billion euros of debt. 
Commodity markets were much rougher. Brent crude fell 5.81% to $24.80 per barrel as the United States, Russia, and Saudi Arabia jostled over a massive oversupply of oil. 
Crude oil benchmarks ended the quarter with their biggest losses in history. Both U.S. and Brent futures got hammered throughout March by the pandemic and a Saudi-Russia price war.
Global demand has been cut sharply by travel restrictions. Forecasters at major merchants and banks see demand slumping by 20% to 30% in April, and for weak consumption to linger for months.

(Reuters) - Asian equities recorded their biggest foreign outflow in at least 12 years in March, hit by the coronavirus pandemic and its impact on businesses across the region, with most factories shuttered to contain its spread.
Overseas investors sold a net $33.3 billion worth of regional equities last month, the highest since at least January 2008, data from stock exchanges in India, Indonesia, the Philippines, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam showed.
(Graphic: Foreign investments in Asian equities link: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/jbyvrladveo/Foreign%20investments%20in%20Asian%20equities.jpg)
A shortage of dollars as many institutional investors scrambled to safer currencies to hedge against volatility also hit flows into emerging Asian equities, analysts said.
(Graphic: Combined foreign investments in Asian equities link: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/xlbvggxxvqd/Combined%20foreign%20investments%20in%20Asian%20equities.jpg) 
""We have seen fund flows coming out of EM, both from bonds and equity. Majority of this is a flight to safety as the COVID-19 cases have rebounded from developed markets into Asia specifically,"" said Paul Sandhu, head of multi-assets quant solutions at  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) Asset Management in Hong Kong.
""However,this won't last as we believe funds will return to Asia equities, in particular, as more is known on the extent of the COVID-19 impact in the U.S.""
Taiwan and South Korean equities led the region, with outflows of more than $10 billion each in the last month. 
South Korea's March exports slipped 0.2% from a year earlier, data showed on Wednesday, as the coronavirus affected factory production and supply chains. South Korea's nationwide infections are just below 10,000, making it the largest outbreak in Asia outside China.
Indian markets saw an outflow of about $8.3 billion, with its equity markets pulled down by a 21-day nationwide lockdown, which has raised fears of a devastating impact on an already-slowing economy. 
Indonesia, and Vietnam also had outflows of about $400 million each in the last month. 
In the first quarter, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan (MIAP00000PUS) plunged about 20%, registering the biggest quarterly decline since September 2008. 
The index fell 12% in March, the biggest monthly decline since October 2008.
Rajat Agarwal, strategist at  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN), said the sharp decline in the market has started to price in a much lower earnings growth than the current consensus expectation.
""We don't expect a V-shape recovery in earnings at the Asia level like that in 2008-09. The Asian markets will continue to have very diverging trends in earnings this year,"" he said.

""We recommend to focus on markets and sectors with earnings visibility like Taiwan and Asia Technology sector, respectively.""

IHS Markit's manufacturing purchasing managers' index for the euro zone fell to its lowest since 2012 in March, while the manufacturing PMI in Italy, which has been hit hardest by the Covid-19 epidemic, hit an 11-year low. 
Factory activity also dropped sharply across most of Asia in March, according to Markit's PMIs, with regional economic powerhouses Japan and South Korea, major exporters to Europe, posting their biggest contractions in about a decade.
The Bank of Japan's ""tankan"" corporate survey showed Japanese manufacturers turned pessimistic for the first time in seven years.
The surveys illustrate the economic damage caused by the pandemic that has infected more than 850,000 people, killed over 42,000, upended supply chains and led to city lockdowns worldwide.
President Donald Trump warned Americans late Tuesday to brace for a “rough two-week period” ahead as the White House released new projections that there could be 100,000 to 240,000 deaths in the U.S. from the coronavirus pandemic.
In corporate news, the European banking sector was sharply lower, with U.K. banks leading the way after a number of them said they would cancel their dividend payments at the U.K. financial regulators request.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - KKR & Co (N:KKR) has shelved a plan to sell Singapore-based Goodpack, which provides shipping containers and logistics services, after the coronavirus outbreak hit valuations, sources with knowledge of the matter said on Wednesday.
The private equity group had received bids from a few consortiums after tapping more than a dozen potential buyers late last year, the sources said, adding that a deal could have valued Goodpack at about $2 billion. 
""Till about six weeks ago, bidders were interested and a deal looked likely but there's a lot of uncertainty in the current environment,"" said one of the sources.
The sources declined to be identified as the shelving of the deal has not been made public. KKR declined to comment.
A successful deal would have ranked as one of the largest private-equity backed sales in Asia excluding Japan and Australia for the past few years, according to data from Refinitiv. 
KKR acquired Goodpack for about S$1.4 billion ($985 million)in 2014 and delisted it from Singapore Exchange. Goodpack then changed senior management, expanded into new markets such as food and chemicals and set up offices in Europe and the United States.
Goodpack's network is embedded in the supply chain of many multinational companies and its business is expected to weather any short-term downturn, the source said.
It also caters to global customers in the rubber and automotive sectors with operations across 80 countries and about 5,000 delivery and collection points. 
The coronavirus pandemic has prompted governments around the world to impose social distancing and other containment measures that have brought many businesses to a near standstill.

The China Securities Regulatory Commission said it has accepted applications from the two money managers as the country scraps foreign ownership caps in the sector on April 1 as planned.
""China is making as clear as China can make clear in its intention that this is a market that is open to foreign participation,"" said Peter Alexander, founder and managing director of fund consultancy Z-Ben Advisors.
""China is trying to demonstrate in this period of heightened uncertainty in Europe and the United States that they were able to work through very successfully the COVID-19 virus, and that very quickly they were able to get back to business as usual.""
The announcement came a day after the city government of Beijing said it had launched an outbound investment scheme that attracted applicants including Oaktree, Bridgewater and Amundi.
It also follows China's approval to Goldman Sachs (N:GS) and  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS) to take majority stakes in their China securities ventures.
A mutual fund unit would expand the China footprint of BlackRock, which already owns a private fund management unit and a joint venture mutual fund house in China.

""We firmly believe that China is one of the biggest opportunities for BlackRock over the long term.""
The applications were expected, as China agreed to fully open its mutual fund and brokerage sectors on April 1 as part of the interim Sino-U.S. trade deal signed in January.
Other global asset managers including Fidelity International and  Schroders  (LON:SDR) also plan to submit applications once rules allow, the government of Shanghai said last month.

Fidelity said China is a critical market for the fund manager and it would apply for mutual fund management license when ready. Schroders was not immediately available for comment.

Investing.com - European stock markets are set to open lower Wednesday, as more survey evidence of economic damage in Asia caused by the coronavirus pandemic outweighed talk of another rescue package in the U.S.
At 2:15 AM ET (0615 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 2.5% lower. CAC 40 futures were down 3.9%, while the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. fell 4.2%.
Factory activity dropped sharply across most of Asia in March, according to the latest Purchasing Managers' Index surveys, with regional economic powerhouses Japan and South Korea, major exporters to Europe, posting their biggest contractions in about a decade.
The Bank of Japan's ""tankan"" corporate survey showed Japanese manufacturers turned pessimistic for the first time in seven years.
The surveys illustrate the economic damage caused by the pandemic that has infected more than 850,000 people, killed over 42,000, upended supply chains and led to city lockdowns worldwide.
Surveys due later on Wednesday from countries including Germany and the United States are expected to do similarly little for investor confidence.
This news has overshadowed the possibility, raised by President Donald Trump, of more money being introduced into the system.


This would require Congressional approval, and is likely to run into political opposition given the vast sums of money already pledged to help the country’s economy recover from this shutdown.
In corporate news, the U.K. banking sector is likely to be in focus after the Hong Kong-listed shares of HSBC (LON:HSBA) and  Standard Chartered  (LON:STAN) plunged earlier Wednesday as both cancelled dividend payments at the U.K. financial regulator’s request.
The data barrage continues in Europe Wednesday, with manufacturing PMI data scheduled for the whole region. Eyes are likely to be on the U.S. ADP nonfarm employment data, at 8:15 AM ET (1215 GMT), ahead of Friday’s official payrolls release.
Oil markets declined again as the weak factory survey data out of Asia offered more evidence of the damage done to oil demand by the pandemic.
At 2:05 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 1.9% lower at $20.09 a barrel. The international benchmark Brent contract fell 3.7% to $25.38.
Elsewhere, gold futures rose 0.3% to $1,600.50/oz after another fall on Tuesday, while EUR/USD traded at 1.1021, down 0.1% on the day.

Cook said in a post on Twitter last week that Apple donated 10 million masks for health professionals in the United States and Europe, which it sourced through its supply networks.
Supplies and donations have come in from wealthy executives and corporates around the world to fight the coronavirus, which has killed more than 42,000 people globally.
Chinese billionaire and  Alibaba  (N:BABA) co-founder Jack Ma has pledged similar medical supply donations including masks and testing kits, as have other Chinese tech giants such as Baidu (O:BIDU), Tencent (HK:0700), Huawei and ByteDance, according to Chinese media reports. 
Apple has already donated 20 million yuan of its promised amount through Beijing-based China Foundation for Poverty Alleviation to support six hospitals in Hubei, including the makeshift Leishenshan hospital in Wuhan, Cook said.
Apple will contribute the rest of the money to support longer-term public health recovery efforts, he said.
""China has shown incredible spirit and resilience during the COVID-19 outbreak and we are grateful to our teams, partners and customers for their support during these challenging times,"" Cook said in a message on China's Twitter equivalent Weibo.
COVID-19 is the name of the respiratory disease caused by the coronavirus.
Apple warned last month it was unlikely to meet its March-quarter sales guidance as the ramp-up of Chinese factories that produce iPhones was slower than expected after weeks of closures.

The flu-like virus originated in China last year and has since spread across 205 countries and territories. Globally it has infected more 850,000 people, according to a Reuters tally.

77,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 01, 2020 12:40AM ET</span>",China developers raise funds at home to repay pricier offshore debt,"By Clare Jim and Samuel Shen
HONG KONG/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Chinese property firms facing a wave of maturing debt will raise funds on the mainland to refinance their offshore borrowings as funding conditions loosen in the world's second-largest economy at a time when the dollar bond market is slumping.
Companies traditionally refinance bonds where they are issued to lower foreign exchange and transaction costs, but the coronavirus outbreak and ensuing scramble for dollars triggered a jump in yields for Asian debt. That has made it too prohibitive for companies to sell bonds offshore.
High-yield, B-rated dollar bonds issued by Chinese developers have seen their yields jump to more than 13% from less than 6% at the end of February, official data shows.
Yields in China's bond market, on the contrary, dropped as authorities guided interest rates lower and pumped liquidity into the economy gridlocked by widespread restrictions to contain the spread of coronavirus. Shanghai's interbank benchmark rate Shibor fell nearly 50 basis points during the same period.
""We will go wherever is cheap to borrow and wherever is reasonable to do more (financing),"" Guangzhou-based Agile Group's (HK:3383) Chairman Chen Zhuo Lin said at an earnings conference last week.
Agile, which has not issued any offshore bonds so far this year, has an offshore refinancing gap of $900 million in 2020, the second highest in the industry, according to Bank of America (NYSE:BAC).
Chen said the company would not rule out using dividends and internal capital to repay offshore debt, adding it was in talks to borrow offshore syndication loans, where interest rates were lower.
Developers such as  Country Garden  (HK:2007), the country's largest, and Hangzhou-based Greentown China (HK:3900) also said they could reallocate their capital from onshore.
Longfor Group (HK:0960) and Times China (HK:1233) said they would focus on issuing corporate bonds in Shanghai, capitalizing on China's loosening policy.
""The (Hong Kong) window now is not good, we won't issue bonds even when we have the quota,"" said Country Garden CFO Wu Bijun. ""Onshore channels are more smooth.""
Some developers, including  Sunac  China (HK:1918) and Ronshine China (HK:3301), have taken advantage of the drop in dollar bond prices and repurchased some of their bonds from the open market.
Redsun Properties (HK:1996) and Zhenro Properties (HK:6158) said they would consider doing the same.
Analysts said they were not concerned about a spike in offshore defaults as most of the issuers were bigger companies that have multiple fund raising channels and many had sold dollar bonds in January when investor appetite was good. But risks for the smaller and weaker names would increase.
Regulatory approval is needed for companies to transfer onshore yuan to repay offshore bonds, but Bank of America analysts see scope for the regulator to approve remittances.
According to Moody's, its rated developers' total offshore issuance in March dropped to $3.7 billion from a record high of $16.5 billion in January, while onshore bond issuance increased to 18.4 billion yuan ($2.6 billion) in March from 10.9 billion yuan in February.
""Should markets stabilize, there should still be property developers looking to raise offshore USD financing,"" Samantha Xie, J.P. Morgan's head of China debt capital markets, said. ""We would expect the first batch of issuers to be industry leaders, the top names.

Webjet joins several Australian companies rushing to secure funds as lockdowns force them to burn through cash while income dwindles amid supply chain disruptions and weak consumer sentiment.
The agency said it would raise the amount through a fully underwritten institutional placement worth A$101 million and a partially underwritten entitlement offer worth A$174 million.
The proceeds are expected to be sufficient to cover operating costs and capital spending until the end of 2020, even if severe travel restrictions continue, Webjet said in a statement.
In early March, the company scrapped the guidance for core earnings for full-year 2020 it had just issued a month prior, due to a surge in short-notice cancellations and a drop in overall booking activity.
""Webjet anticipates that any revenue contribution in the near-term will be nominal only, until the situation improves and travel activity resumes,"" it said on Wednesday.
The company said it would make more than 440 roles redundant, defer its interim dividend payment and reduce executive pay, while its managing director would take a 60% cut to his salary for calendar year 2020 and forgo his bonus.
The cost saving measures will help save about A$13 million per month, with further measures planned if the situation does not improve over the next six months, Webjet added.

80,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 31, 2020 10:40PM ET</span>","UK banks scrap dividends on coronavirus fears, pressure on bonuses","By Lawrence White and Iain Withers
LONDON/HONG KONG (Reuters) - Britain's top banks said on Tuesday they would suspend dividend payments after pressure from the regulator, saving their capital as a buffer against expected losses from the economic fallout from the coronavirus.
 Barclays  (L:BARC), HSBC (L:HSBA), Lloyds Banking Group (L:LLOY), Royal Bank of Scotland (L:RBS),  Standard Chartered  (L:STAN) and the British arm of Spain's Santander (MC:SAN) all halted payouts.
The lenders had been due to pay out over 8 billion pounds ($9.93 billion) between them in 2019 dividends, with HSBC the biggest payer at $4.2 billion.
The move came in response to a request from the  Prudential  (LON:PRU) Regulatory Authority (PRA), which also asked banks and insurers not to pay senior staff bonuses this year.
Hong Kong shares of HSBC (HK:0005) fell as much as 9.9% to their lowest since March 2009, while StanChart dropped 7.4% in the morning trade on Wednesday. The broader Hong Kong market index (HSI) was down 0.4%.
The British lenders said they would not pay interim dividends for 2020 and scrapped planned 2019 payouts, but held off announcing changes to their executive pay policies. 
The PRA said banks entered the epidemic, which has put Britain into lockdown, with strong capital positions, enough to withstand a severe UK and global recession. 
""The bank has a strong capital base, but we think it is right and prudent, for the many businesses and people that we support, to take these steps now,"" Barclays Chairman Nigel Higgins said.
Banks pay out dividends as a means of rewarding shareholders and disposing of excess profits, but they have the option to retain the earnings instead to preserve their capital levels.
FOLLOWING ECB'S LEAD
The statements from British lenders come after the European Central Bank (ECB) last week asked euro zone lenders to skip dividend payments and share buybacks until October at the earliest, and use their profits to support the economy.
Several of Europe's largest lenders, including UniCredit (MI:CRDI), and  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN), have already announced they will hold off paying 2019 dividends for now.
However, there are some hold outs. Swiss banking giants UBS (S:UBSG) and  Credit Suisse  (S:CSGN) have both said they plan to press ahead with 2019 dividends despite their home regulator urging caution over payouts.
The move to scrap 2019 shareholder distributions is expected to free up capital that banks can instead lend to businesses and consumers rocked by the coronavirus pandemic.
But some analysts believe cancelling dividends could actually harm the supply of credit to the real economy.
""We note that euro area bank market capitalization fell on 30 March by the same as the 30 billion euros 'saved' by its dividend ban on Friday 27 March,"" analysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) said in a note to clients, referring to the ECB's move. 
The European Union's banking watchdog said earlier on Tuesday that banks should be ""conservative"" in how they award bonuses to preserve capital and keep lending during the coronavirus pandemic.
However it stopped short of calling on banks to stop bonuses altogether. 
Italy's UniCredit and Spain's BBVA (MC:BBVA) have both said this week that their top management will waive their 2020 bonuses. 
Standard Chartered signaled in a memo on Monday that the bank would likely cut its 2020 executive payouts.
PRA Chief Executive Sam Woods also wrote to heads of insurers, saying they should pay ""close attention"" to the need to protect policyholders and maintain safety and soundness when considering bonuses or dividends.
HSBC signaled a gloomy first-quarter earnings season for British banks, warning in its statement that it would see bad loans rising and revenues falling as the economic impact of the pandemic hits.

81,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 31, 2020 09:55PM ET</span>",Xerox abandons $35 billion hostile bid for HP,"By Greg Roumeliotis
(Reuters) - U.S. printer maker Xerox (NYSE:XRX) Holdings Corp walked away from its $35 billion hostile cash-and-stock bid for HP Inc (NYSE:HPQ) on Tuesday, after the coronavirus outbreak weighed on its campaign to take over the PC and printing equipment manufacturer.
Xerox's decision came after it said earlier this month it would postpone meetings with HP shareholders to focus on coping with the coronavirus pandemic. 
It represents a victory for HP CEO Enrique Lores, who faced a takeover battle as soon as he took over the reins of the Palo Alto, California-based company in November, and a defeat for Xerox CEO John Visentin, a former Hewlett-Packard and  IBM  (NYSE:IBM) Corp executive with ties to the private equity industry who took over as Xerox CEO in 2018.
It is also a blow for billionaire investor Carl Icahn, who owns big stakes in both companies and had pushed for their merger. 
Xerox was set to challenge HP's board at the latter's annual meeting of shareholders in May, but will now abandon this effort as well as its tender offer for HP's shares, the company said in a statement.
""While it is disappointing to take this step, we are prioritizing the health, safety and well-being of our employees, customers, partners and other stakeholders, and our broader response to the pandemic, over and above all other considerations,"" Xerox said.
Xerox added that there were compelling long-term financial and strategic benefits in a potential combination with HP. While it is possible that the companies will choose to engage once the coronavirus crisis subsides, Xerox's decision means that it will not get another chance to put such pressure on HP until its next annual shareholder meeting in spring 2021. 
The banks financing Xerox's takeover bid ""never wavered in their commitments"" despite the market turmoil fueled by the coronavirus outbreak, the Norwalk, Connecticut-based company said.
""HP would like to thank our shareholders, partners, customers and employees for their input and continued support through this process,"" HP said in a statement. 
The market rout triggered by the global coronavirus outbreak has led many companies to hit the pause button on mergers and acquisitions, sabotaging the hopes of corporate advisers who expected a dealmaking bonanza this year.
Both Xerox and HP have seen their business suffer in the wake of the coronavirus crisis, though HP's stock has proved more resilient, as employees working for home to protect themselves from the virus boosted revenue for its PCs and other office equipment. Xerox shares have lost more than half their value in the last five weeks, while HP shares are down about a quarter. 
PRINTING IN DECLINE
The printing industry is in decline as companies and consumers turn to digital documents to save money and help the environment. This has put pressure on companies in the sector to consolidate and reverse their revenue decline through acquisitions that can boost their market share.
HP, which separated from servers and networking equipment provider Hewlett-Packard Enterprise Inc in 2015, has participated in this consolidation, acquiring Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) Co Ltd's printer business for $1.05 billion in 2017.
Nevertheless, HP had been reluctant to engage in deal discussions with Xerox since November, when the latter launched its takeover campaign after reaching a settlement with Fujifilm Holdings Corp that resolved a legal dispute over their 57-year-old joint venture and a previous attempt to merge, yielding a $2.3 billion after-tax payoff for Xerox.
HP said that Xerox's offer undervalued it and disputed the $2 billion value of potential cost synergies that Xerox put forward in a possible combination. It argued that its sale to Xerox would saddle the combined company with too much debt, and also raised questions on the impact on Xerox's supply chain of losing Fujifilm as a partner.
HP engaged in deal talks with Xerox last year at the invitation of Icahn, a top Xerox shareholder who has since also acquired a stake in HP. These talks stalled after the companies failed to agree on the amount of confidential information they shared with each other.

HP relies on its desktop and notebook PCs business for the majority of its net revenue but gets the bulk of its earnings from its printing hardware and supplies division.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. pension funds that delayed rebalancing their portfolios are likely to pump about $400 billion into stocks over the next two quarters, analysts at JP Morgan said, providing a potential boost to equity markets battered by the coronavirus pandemic. 
Weeks of asset price volatility may have pushed some fund managers to postpone rebalancing portfolios where equity allocations have been knocked out of whack by a sharp decline in stocks, the bank said in a note to investors. The S&P 500 fell 20% since the start of the year, marking its worst quarter since 2008.
""We still expect that US pension funds will eventually rebalance within 1-2 quarters,"" wrote strategist Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou. 
The bank said its estimate of $400 billion in equity buying by the funds over the next two quarters could prove conservative. U.S. pension funds bought $200 billion in stocks by the first quarter of 2009, in the aftermath of the global financial crisis -- equivalent to $600 billion today, the bank said. 
Wild market swings have presented a challenge to asset managers looking to square their portfolios against a benchmark or return to their long-maintained allocation of stocks versus bonds. While the S&P is down about 24% from its February highs, unprecedented support from the Federal Reserve and a $2.2 trillion relief package from U.S. lawmakers helped stocks rally 15.5% since March 23. 
At least one fund -- the Los Angeles City Employees' Retirement System, which oversees some $15 billion -- is allowing its rebalancing to be deferred, according to a report in Pensions & Investments. The fund did not immediately respond turn a request for comment.
Brian Reynolds, chief market strategist with Reynolds Strategy, said in a note this week a rebalancing that leads pensions to sell bonds and buy stocks ""makes no sense for pensions given the capital calls they are facing from credit and related products.""
Some index providers, such as S&P Dow Jones Indices, have delayed their quarterly rebalancing due to the market volatility, potentially complicating the picture for funds that look to track index performance. 
Last week's rally in stocks may have helped boost some funds' equity allocations, making the need to increase exposure less acute, said Mike Schumacher, head of macro strategy at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities. 
The bank last week had estimated that U.S. corporate pensions will need to shift about $40 billion from fixed income into equities to maintain allocation targets. Its estimate now stands at $20 billion following last week's rally, Schumacher said. 
At the same time, mutual funds, pensions and other asset managers rebalancing their portfolio may have stoked some of last week's gains.
Steven DeSanctis, an equity strategist at Jefferies, said moves from fixed income into equities ""most likely"" happened last week, adding that ""the rebalancings don’t have to take place on the 31st.""
Jack Janasiewicz, portfolio strategist at Natixis Investment Managers Solutions, said some of the market's recent gains have come from quarter-end and month-end rebalancing. 

""Once we get through the next couple of days, it's going to be a little bit more interesting because the question then becomes, 'Do we return really back to fundamentals and technicals?'.""

LONDON (Reuters) - Invesco said on Tuesday it would sell all the unquoted companies currently held in its UK equities portfolios and has marked down their value by 60% as a result of recent coronavirus-fueled market falls.
The U.S.-based manager said it would reinvest the money in publicly listed companies, valuations of which have been hit hard in recent weeks as fears about a global recession gripped markets.
""We recognize, of course, that a reallocation of capital from unquoted to publicly listed equity is a change in the fund composition,"" it said in a statement on its website.
""However, these are extraordinary times which call for decisive and positive action to look after the best interests of clients in the short and longer term.""
The holding of unlisted or illiquid stocks in funds that allow daily access has faced criticism from investors, regulators and politicians in the UK after the high-profile collapse of Woodford Investment Management last year.
Run by Neil Woodford, formerly a fund manager at Invesco, the firm's flagship fund was suspended from trading amid a liquidity squeeze that ultimately resulted in his company collapsing.
That put pressure on Invesco's High Income and Income funds, which held some of the same stocks as Woodford.
In response to news of the decision to sell out of unlisted stocks completely, Juliet Schooling Latter, research director at Chelsea Financial Services, said she considered the move ""drastic"".
""We understand Invesco’s wish to move away from these assets into more attractive parts of the market, but the amount of writedown is unjustified in our view,"" she wrote in a note.
""While there may be investor appetite for the funds to hold fewer unquoted stocks, I would doubt that investors would want this at the cost of a 5% drop in the value of their investments.”

Investing.com - Wall Street ended lower today, but in more subdued trading indicative of a market that just wanted to get the first quarter in the rearview mirror.
As April begins tomorrow the market is facing at least an entire month with an economy on lockdown.
President Donald Trump said at the daily briefing after the bell today it was going to be a “very, very painful two weeks”
Stocks have responded well to bad economic news lately on hopes that it could prompt more money from Washington. More March data arrives Wednesday morning.
And the battered oil market will look at inventories after an unusually strong API measure today.
Here are three things that could move the market tomorrow.
1. Infrastructure Plan Solid
With the fiscal stimulus package put to bed, the market didn’t have to wait long for another possibility of more money in the system arising.
Trump raised the possibility of a $2 trillion infrastructure package. Right now this is purely a Trump idea and it would need Congressional approval. It may just be a trial balloon but Wall Street will be watching Trump’s twitter account to see if there are any more signs it will be pursued.
Also, with New York the epicenter of the pandemic in the U.S., the market is reacting to the latest info from there.
Governor Andrew Cuomo has been giving updates at 11:30 AM ET (15:30 GMT) and his schedule can be found here.
2. ISM Manufacturing, ADP) Employment on Tap
On the economic calendar, the Institute of Supply Management will report its March manufacturing purchasing managers’ index (PMI) at 10:00 AM ET (14:00 GMT).
Economists are looking for a drop in the manufacturing PMI to 45 from 50.1 the month before, according to forecasts compiled by Investing.com.
Manufacturing showed a little resilience in the Markit PMI earlier this month, but the services sector is the lion’s share of the U.S. economy and has virtually shut down.
At 8:15 AM ET, ADP (NASDAQ:ADP) will release its measure of private-sector jobs for March.
Private payrolls are expected to have dropped by 150,000, according to economists’ forecasts compiled by Investing.com. But that reading won’t encapsulate the full effect of the pandemic on jobs this month.
The government jobs report on Friday will also be somewhat incomplete, with the survey taken during the week of March 12.
“Anyone who worked one hour that week will be included in the payroll survey and not yet have hit the ranks of the unemployed,” Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton, wrote in a note today.
Given the surge in jobless claims, “(c)ould the number crunchers at the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) decide to update their estimates on the birth and death rates of firms to more accurately capture the March turning point?” Swonk asked.
“Should any changes to our methodology be necessary they will be made clear to the public and available upon release of the data,” the BLS replied.
3. Oil Inventories Expected to Have Risen
The oil market is reeling from its worst quarter ever. Demand is cratering and Saudi Arabia is still pumping out as much as possible in order to gain market share.
But there are still fundamentals for traders to go on and today’s oil stockpile numbers should add some interest to the official government numbers tomorrow.
The American Petroleum Institute said its measure of crude inventories rose by about 10.5 million barrels last week, indicating that the demand destruction from the economic disruption is now showing up in these numbers.
The Energy Information Administration releases its oil inventory numbers tomorrow at 10:30 AM ET (14:30 GMT).
Analysts are looking for a build of about 4 million barrels, according to forecasts compiled by Investing.com."

HP (NYSE:HPQ) was down 1.2% and Xerox (NYSE:XRX) was up 0.21% in postmarket trading.
The move will see Xerox end its proxy war to replace the HP's board, The Wall Street Journal reported, citing people familiar with the matter.
HP had repeatedly rejected Xerox advances, deeming the lastest $35 billion offer too risky and arguing that it undervalued the company.

Investing.com – A wave of late selling hit Wall Street Tuesday, leading to the Dow suffering its worst ever first quarter amid worries the widely-expected recession in the U.S. may be worse than feared as the Covid-19 pandemic intensified.
The Dow fell 1.8%, taking its losses for the quarter to 23%, its steepest first-quarter decline on record. The S&P 500 slipped 1.6% and the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.95%.
The U.S. reported nearly 11,000 new Covid-19 cases since Monday, taking the total to about 174,000, with about 3,400 dead so far, following a spike in infections in New York, the epicenter of the outbreak in the U.S.
In New York state, coronavirus infections jumped 14% overnight to 75,795, with Gov. Andrew Cuomo conceding that the virus is more dangerous than expected.
""I’m tired of being behind this virus. We’ve been behind this virus from day one,"" Cuomo said. ""We underestimated this virus. It’s more powerful, it’s more dangerous than we expected.""
With little end to sight to the pandemic, Wall Street has warned of an even gloomier economic backdrop despite growing expectations Congress and the Federal Reserve will ensure the well of stimulus remains deep.
""With interest rates for the United States being at ZERO, this is the time to do our decades long awaited Infrastructure Bill,” President Donald Trump tweeted today.
""It should be VERY BIG & BOLD, Two Trillion Dollars, and be focused solely on jobs and rebuilding the once great infrastructure of our Country! Phase 4,” he added.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) now expects real U.S. gross domestic product to shrink 9% in the first quarter and 34% in the second three months of the year, on an annualized basis, compared with a previous forecast for falls of 6% and 24% respectively. The investment bank said, however, it expected gradual recovery in output to get underway in May or June.
Against the growing expectation of economic doom, Trump is expected to announce a three-month delay to tariff payments of some imported goods, Bloomberg reported. The order, however, will not include a reprieve on levies imposed on Chinese goods nor on aluminum and steel imports.
""The order, which could come as soon as this week, would give the Treasury Department the authority to direct Customs and Border Protection to delay collecting tariffs on those imports for 90 days,"" according to the report.
Defensive corners of the market like real estate and utilities led the market lower as investors positioned their portfolio for the quarter-end.
Energy, however, proved an exception to the decline, rising 1.82%, though had been up more than 3% earlier, on growing hopes Saudi Arabia and Russia may call a truce on their price war in an effort to stabilize the market."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A group of workers at Whole Foods Market called on others to phone in sick at all of the grocer's stores on Tuesday to protest what they say is a lack of adequate compensation and protections from the coronavirus.
The group, known on Twitter as Whole Worker, describes itself as a grassroots movement of Whole Foods team members working to unionize.
The group did not respond to a request for comment and it is not known how many Whole Foods employees called in sick. A representative for Amazon.com-owned Whole Foods did not respond to a request for comment.
As millions of people shelter in place in the United States and non-essential businesses are shuttered to halt the spread of the virus, grocery stores and pharmacies are staying open to supply food and medicine.
The Whole Worker group is demanding, among other things, hazard pay and the immediate shutdown of any location where a worker tests positive for COVID-19. If a store is closed, all workers should receive full pay until the store can safely reopen, according to the group's Twitter account.
At two locations in New York, there were no apparent disruptions. At stores in Harlem and the East Village neighborhoods, customers were shopping while clerks where restocking shelves and ringing up purchases.
Whole Foods said earlier this month it was raising pay for its full and part-time hourly workers employees by $2 per hour. It also said it was reducing hours to allow for extra cleaning and shutting self-serve salad and antipasti bars. 
Total deaths from the virus in the United States hit 3,017, including at least 540 on Monday, and reported cases climbed to more than 163,000, according to a Reuters tally.
The call for action at Whole Foods won the endorsement of the United Food and Commercial Workers union which has 1.3 million members in the grocery industry.
On Monday, warehouse, delivery and retail gig workers at Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and grocery delivery company Instacart in the United States went on strike to call attention to safety and wage concerns for people laboring through the coronavirus crisis.
Amazon said later it fired an employee who helped organize the action at a New York warehouse for alleged violations of his employment, including leaving a paid quarantine to participate in the demonstration.
The call for action won the endorsement of the United Food and Commercial Workers union which has 1.3 million members in the grocery industry.

Whole Foods employs 95,000 people and has 487 stores in the United States, 14 stores in Canada and seven stores in Britain.

The bank added it was currently analyzing potential scenarios and their impact on the bank's results from the crisis, as well as ""potential corrective measures"".
SocGen also sought to reassure investors, saying it had a solid balance sheet and was committed to improving profitability.
SocGen said its board would propose guidelines on dividends in the second half of the year, that could consist in the payment of an interim dividend on 2020 results or an exceptional dividend in the form of a distribution of reserves.

French investment bank Natixis also decided to skip 2019 dividends, saying its board will reconsider this decision after Oct. 1 in order to allow for a potential distribution.

104,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 31, 2020 03:18PM ET</span>",Deeply Distressed Companies Risk Being Shut Out From Fed’s Loans,"(Bloomberg) -- Troubled companies behind on their bills or already in bankruptcy may be out of luck when it comes to getting federal funds from the U.S. stimulus package.
Current law blocks the government from making loans to companies that have either filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy or fail an insolvency test, according to lawyers who’ve studied the new legislation. In that scenario, it would be nearly impossible for such borrowers to access financing from the Federal Reserve.
Some businesses angling for government relief “may discover a rude awakening” if those standards still apply to the new Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act, said Vincent Indelicato, a partner specializing in restructuring and bankruptcy law at Proskaur Rose. “This bill may not be the economic life preserver companies and their lenders were hoping for.”
Record Size
The size of the $2 trillion stimulus is unprecedented, surpassing the approximately $800 billion package that passed after the 2008 financial crash. The coronavirus plan provides about $500 billion in loans and assistance for big companies, provided they retain most of their employees and don’t buy back stock. Airlines are eligible for grants in exchange for giving the government equity stakes.
There is a separate pool of about $350 billion for small business loans, which won’t have to be paid back if used for staff compensation, mortgage interest and rent.
But the Federal Reserve doesn’t typically lend to insolvent borrowers -- those who have trouble meeting their financial obligations or paying down debt when it comes due. That’s to protect against situations where companies access taxpayer or government funds, only to file for bankruptcy and leave the government with mounting losses.
Hard Lesson
Restrictions were put in place in 2015 after some companies bailed out under previous rescue packages wound up stiffing the federal government. In 2009, for example, middle-market lender CIT Group Inc. filed bankruptcy less than a year after getting billions in federal aid, wiping out the preferred stock sold to the U.S. Treasury.
Under the Federal Reserve Act, insolvency is determined by an inability to pay debts within 90 days before accessing a federal loan. How companies fit into the legislation passed by the Senate and House of Representatives last week remains a subject of debate, with business managers left to wonder how or if they qualify for relief.
Requests for comment from the U.S. Treasury Department and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, the act’s sponsor, weren’t immediately returned.
“Companies in distress probably saw the $500 billion headline and imagined they caught the Hampton Jitney,” Indelicato said, referring to the shuttle service to New York’s tony beach retreats. “But they may have already missed the bus,” he said. “This is uncharted territory for everyone.”
If a company does get aid and files bankruptcy anyway, the federal loan would likely be treated the same as any other debt under Chapter 11 rules, said Amy Quackenboss, executive director of the American Bankruptcy Institute.
BDC Borrowers
Firms that borrowed from business development companies, a type of private credit lender, may be eligible for the relief, according to a recent report from Raymond James & Associates.
Some BDCs are actively examining how their portfolio companies can benefit from the stimulus package. In a recent note to shareholders, Bain Capital Specialty Finance Inc. Chief Executive Officer Michael Ewald said, “We are also actively pursuing opportunities for BCSF to benefit from the recently enacted CARES Act.”
But some companies backed by private equity firms may not be so lucky. They could find themselves shut out due to affiliation rules that would count the employees of the sponsor along with the borrower to see if they fall below a 500-worker threshold.
There are some 60,000 private equity-backed middle market companies in the U.S., according to the National Center for the Middle Market, the vast majority leaning on direct lenders for their financing needs.
Companies in the middle market that faced trouble before the virus outbreak are particularly vulnerable and will be the first to go bust, said Aram Ordubegian at restructuring law firm Arent Fox.
“A small jolt would have pushed them over,” Fox said. “Well, this is a big jolt.”
For companies pushed into bankruptcy by the coronavirus, the law does loosen some restrictions, according to an analysis by the law firm Foley & Lardner. The debt limit on small businesses seeking to use rules that make it easier for them to reorganize has been increased from $2.7 million to $7.5 million.
Bankrupt companies hit with financial troubles caused by the virus can also rewrite reorganization plans that have already been approved by a court. Both provisions expire after one year.
Consumers also got a break in the bill, which doesn’t allow any federal money they receive to count against them in bankruptcy when determining their income and ability to repay creditors, said the ABI’s Quackenboss.
“Consumers and small businesses will have greater access to the financial fresh start of bankruptcy,” she said in a statement.

The Dow fell 0.67%, or 149 points, but was up about 152 points at session at the highs of the day. The S&P 500 slipped 0.54% and the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.17%.

(Reuters) - Wall Street's slide deepened on Tuesday, with the S&P 500 was set for its worst first quarter since 1938 on growing evidence of a largescale corporate damage from the coronavirus pandemic as well as a near collapse in oil prices.
The benchmark index was tracking its biggest quarterly decline since the 2008 financial crisis, losing more than $5 trillion in market value, as the health crisis worsened in the United States and brought business activity to a standstill.
Real estate stocks <.SPLRCR>, utilities (SPLRCU) and consumer staples (SPLRCS) were among the biggest decliners following a recent rally sparked by bargain hunters looking for stocks likely to weather an economic slump.
""The market is in the process of bottoming out, but this will probably be just a lot of back and forth as the market tries to consolidate around one price level,"" said Shawn Cruz, manager of trader strategy at TD Ameritrade in Jersey City, New Jersey.
An unprecedented round of fiscal and monetary stimulus had helped equity markets stabilize following wild swings in the past month that saw the benchmark S&P 500 rise 9% and slump 12% in two consecutive sessions.
With economists slashing 2020 growth expectations, investors fear corporate defaults and more mass layoffs would lead to a deep and lasting global recession.
""Because the outbreak triggered the economic downturn and the swoon in stock prices, a sustained improvement in the outlook is dependent on the containment of the health crisis,"" said Mark Hamrick, economic analyst at Bankrate.com in Washington, DC. 
At 1:34 p.m. ET the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) was down 228.82 points, or 1.02%, at 22,098.66, the S&P 500 (SPX) was down 28.67 points, or 1.09%, at 2,597.98 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) was down 39.13 points, or 0.50%, at 7,735.03.
In one of the fastest turns into a bear market, the Dow Jones and S&P 500 indexes are now set to end the quarter more than 18% below their levels at the start of the year.
The blue-chip Dow is on course for its biggest quarterly percentage decline since 1987, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq is set for its worst three months since 2018.
Technology stocks (SPLRCT), which have posted the smallest declines among the major S&P 500 sectors this quarter, bounced between gains and losses, partly as traders rebalanced their portfolios at the end of the quarter.
The energy index (SPNY) rose nearly 2%, boosted by a rebound in prices from 18-year lows after the United States and Russia agreed to discuss stabilizing energy markets. [O/R]
The sector has lost about half its value this year from the double whammy of the coronavirus and the Russia-Saudi Arabia price war, forcing refiners to cut production and join a slate of U.S. firms looking to raise cash as liquidity evaporated.
Declining issues nearly matched advancers on the NYSE and on the Nasdaq.

The S&P index recorded one new 52-week high and no new low, while the Nasdaq recorded 10 new highs and 29 new lows.

LONDON (Reuters) - Banks should be ""conservative"" in how they award bonuses to preserve capital and keep lending to an economy hit by the COVID-19 pandemic, the European Union's banking watchdog said on Tuesday.
The European Banking Authority (EBA) stopped short of calling on banks to stop bonuses altogether.
""Remuneration and, in particular, its variable portion should be set at a conservative level,"" EBA said in a statement.
""To achieve an appropriate alignment with risks stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic a larger part of the variable remuneration could be deferred for a longer period and a larger proportion could be paid out in equity instruments.""
It builds on an order last Friday from the European Central Bank, which supervises leading euro zone lenders, telling lenders to stop paying dividends and making share buybacks until at least October, estimating they could save 30 billion euros.
Euro zone banks like UniCredit, ABN Amro and Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) have already said they were scrapping dividends, with analysts now anticipating that the Bank of England will adopt a similar stance to the ECB.
EBA said that relief given to banks so far should be used to finance companies and households and not to increase dividends or undertake share buybacks to fill pockets of shareholders.
Banks should consult their regulator if they consider themselves legally required to pay-out dividends or make share buybacks, EBA said.
To ease the regulatory burden on banks so they can focus on helping customers stay afloat, the EBA also said they can have an extra month for submitting routine data on capital and risks which normally takes place between March and May.
The watchdog will also ditch this year's study on the impact of global capital and liquidity requirements on lenders in the bloc.

Investing.com – Wall Street is swinging lower on Tuesday, but copper and steel stocks are sidestepping the selling on hopes a massive ramp-up in infrastructure spending will drive growth. 
""With interest rates for the United States being at ZERO, this is the time to do our decades long awaited Infrastructure Bill,” Trump tweeted.
""It should be VERY BIG & BOLD, Two Trillion Dollars, and be focused solely on jobs and rebuilding the once great infrastructure of our Country! Phase 4,” he added.
United States Steel (NYSE:X) rose 9%, Commercial Metals Company (NYSE:CMC) 5% and Cleveland-Cliffs (NYSE:CLF), also up 9%, were among the biggest gainers.
It is not the first time Trump has pushed for a massive increase in infrastructure spending. In 2016, Trump vowed to seek $1 trillion in infrastructure spending, but bipartisan support fell through as both sides of aisle failed to agree on how much federal funding would be included.
But with the U.S. widely expected to be headed for a deep recession, Trump may find his plans for infrastructure spending could be warmly received.  
House Majority Leader Nancy Pelosi, a day earlier, said a ""Phase 4"" coronavirus stimulus package should include a bipartisan deal on infrastructure spending."

CHICAGO (Reuters) -  American Airlines Group  Inc (O:AAL) is set to sharply increase the number of jets it is planning to retire beyond its announced plans as it accelerates a fleet transformation to respond to the coronavirus crisis, people familiar with the matter said.
Some 4,700 jets have been parked globally as airlines slash operations due to travel restrictions, according to Ascend by Cirium fleet data, and American's decision confirms industry speculation that many of those older jets will not fly again.
In addition to the retirement of 34  Boeing Co  (N:BA) 757s and 17 Boeing 767s announced just two weeks ago, American now plans to also sunset a batch of 76 Boeing 737s it acquired between 1999 and 2001, nine Airbus SE (PA:AIR) A330-300s and 20 Embraer E190s, the people said.
The plans were announced by President Robert Isom in a video Q&A with employees on Sunday, where he said the arrival of new Boeing 737 MAX jets, expected later this year after a prolonged global grounding, could help facilitate the retirement of older jets that would be in need of heavy maintenance.
American is also considering retiring some of its 50-seat regional jets, he said. 
American said on March 12 it was accelerating the retirement of its remaining Boeing 757s and 767s as it looks at removing older, less fuel-efficient aircraft from its fleet.
""Decisions beyond the 757 and 767 have yet to be finalized, and we continue to make refinements to our overall fleet plan,"" American spokesman Ross Feinstein said, adding that decisions would be based on demand.
Airlines around the world have slashed capacity and even the planes flying are nearly empty. Data firm OAG said the aviation industry was less than half the size it was in mid-January, just before countries started confirming coronavirus cases outside China.
Aside from heavy maintenance needs on the A330-300s and some of the 737s, American was also facing retrofitting costs on some of the 737s. It said on Monday it would be seeking up to $12 billion from a government aid package meant to help airlines manage costs during the downturn, particularly for employee payroll.
The pace of aircraft retirements influences an airline's cost structure since new aircraft are costly to buy but cheaper to run. It also gives a clue to potential future demand for new aircraft.
Some analysts are predicting a surplus of aircraft as a wounded airline industry emerges from the coronavirus lockdown into what many economists expect to be a broad recession.
But decisions by airlines to retire planes in 2020 and 2021 could trim that surplus, Ascend by Cirium consultancy head Rob Morris told an Airline Economics webinar on Friday.
The last two years saw a total of 1,130 retirements, he said. Aircraft demand is influenced by a combination of new production and the rate at which airlines retire older planes.
Airlines' fleet plans had been structured around expectations that global travel demand would continue to grow this year and beyond, but now analysts do not expect passenger traffic to recover 2019 levels for some time.
As jets head to parking lots or graveyards, an American 767 landed in Miami from Lima, Peru late Monday in what could have been the final flight for its 767 fleet.

So far American has temporarily parked 135 out of 150 widebodies -- including 787 Dreamliners -- and more than 300 single-aisle jets, and may continue to park more of its smaller aircraft as the crisis continues, Isom told employees.

122,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 31, 2020 01:18PM ET</span>",New ETF Offerings Dried Up During a Volatile March,"(Bloomberg) -- The dramatic volatility in global markets made issuers in the almost $4 trillion exchange-traded fund industry slam the brakes this month.
As the coronavirus pandemic roiled the world, only three new ETFs started trading in March -- the slowest pace since April 2014, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s a steep drop from the 29 funds that were launched in February, the best month since November 2017.
The reason behind the decline is simple: Companies are refraining from ETF debuts amid market turbulence. Additionally, it’s harder for sales people to market their new products when self-isolation measures are making it impossible to hold face-to-face meetings, according to UBS Global Wealth Management’s David Perlman.
“Given the market volatility and just the environment we’re in, it’d be pretty hard to raise assets,” Perlman said. “Advisors and analysts have more pressing issues than reviewing a brand new strategy right now.”
Innovator has been the only issuer to brave the waters in March, with a trio of U.S. stock “buffer” ETFs that seek to shield investors from a certain percentage of losses. The Innovator S&P 500 Ultra Buffer ETF, Innovator S&P 500 Power Buffer ETF and the Innovator S&P 500 Buffer ETF were launched on March 2.
Amid all the uncertainties, it may be hard to predict the trend of ETF debuts next month. But one issuer, American Century, said Tuesday that the American Century Focused Dynamic Growth ETF and the American Century Focused Large Cap Value ETF -- the first active non-transparent ETFs -- will begin trading on April 2.
The fact that the company delayed the launch of these new types of funds was likely to their benefit, according to Bloomberg Intelligence’s Athanasios Psarofagis. American Century said in May that they would license Precidian’s intellectual property for active non-transparent ETFs, after regulators cleared a pathway for the products in the previous month. The plan to launch Thursday likely shows they think markets will stabilize from here, Psarofagis said.
“They are making a market call and hoping to catch an up draft,” said Psarofagis, an ETF analyst. “Since these are active, their performance track record is going to be key.”

BOSTON (Reuters) - A California mother was sentenced on Tuesday to seven months in prison for paying $450,000 to help her daughters gain an illicit edge in the college admissions process, despite her lawyers' arguments that she faced exposure to the coronavirus if she were incarcerated.
Federal prosecutors in Boston say Elizabeth Henriquez and her financier husband, Manuel Henriquez, sought to rig their two daughters' college entrance exam results and secure the oldest one's admission to Georgetown University as a fake tennis recruit.
Prosecutors argued she deserved 26 months in prison after she and her husband, who founded specialty finance lender Hercules Capital Inc, in October pleaded guilty and admitted they were among several wealthy parents who took part in a vast college admissions cheating and fraud scheme.
The Atherton, California, resident appeared before the judge by video, a social distancing step undertaken by the court to deter the spread of COVID-19, which is caused by the novel coronavirus and has killed more than 3,000 people in the United States.
Aaron Katz, her lawyer, argued for home confinement, saying ""it is entirely conceivable federal prison will not be a safe place for Elizabeth until there is a COVID-19 vaccine.""
But U.S. District Judge Nathaniel Gorton said while he could delay when she ultimately reports to prison, Henriquez deserved a seven-month term and a $200,000 fine for committing an ""inexcusable crime of greed, hubris and flaunting of personal wealth.""
Henriquez is among 53 people charged with participating in a scheme in which parents conspired with a California college admissions consultant to use bribery and other forms of fraud to secure the admission of their children to top schools. 
William “Rick” Singer, the consultant, pleaded guilty in March 2019 to charges he facilitated cheating on college entrance exams and helped bribe university sports coaches to present his clients’ children as fake athletic recruits.
The 36 parents charged since March 2019 include “Desperate Housewives” actress Felicity Huffman, who was sentenced in September to 14 days in prison, and “Full House” star Lori Loughlin, who is fighting the charges. 
Prosecutors said the Henriquezes beginning in 2015 paid Singer nearly $50,000 to have an associate proctor the SAT and ACT college entrance exams for their daughters and feed them answers.

Prosecutors said Elizabeth Henriquez also paid $400,000 to have Singer arrange to have a Georgetown tennis coach he was bribing designate her oldest daughter as an athletic recruit.

128,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 31, 2020 12:54PM ET</span>","Europe Dividends Under Pressure, Putting $178 Billion at Risk","(Bloomberg) -- The coronavirus pandemic may cause dividend payments by European companies to halve in 2020, threatening a major source of income for investors in the region’s equities, according to  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C).
With an increasing number of companies lowering, suspending or reviewing their payouts, Citigroup strategists led by Robert Buckland say more could be on the way as a 1.6% contraction in global growth would slash European earnings by 50%.
For pension funds heavily invested in income strategies, the blow will be especially severe. In 2019, continental European firms paid about $251 billion in dividends, while U.K. corporates distributed $106 billion, according to Janus Henderson. Should Citi’s prediction prove accurate, about half of that total, or $178 billion, would be wiped out.
“Dividend per share doesn’t usually fall as much as EPS, but high payout ratios, along with corporate prioritization of balance sheets and employees, may mean European dividends also halve,” Buckland wrote, noting that the payments to shareholders fell by a third during the 2008 financial crisis.
Across the region, companies from luxury-goods makers to banks are under pressure from lawmakers to cut back on payouts. On Monday, the European Central Bank recommended that lenders suspend their dividends and is now looking to force them to do so if they don’t bolster capital during the coronavirus crisis. Meanwhile, Tod’s SpA canceled its payout, with Citigroup analysts predicting more such moves across French and Italian peers.
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analysts estimate that mechanically, if banks dividends were canceled for a full year, this would imply a 8% hit to index level distributions for the MSCI Europe. Should other European bank regulators follow suit, the impact would amount to 18%.
The impact of declining dividends will be felt particularly acutely by investors in Europe, where yields are higher than in the U.S. The Stoxx Europe 600 trailing dividend yield stands at 4.4% compared with 2.3% for the S&P 500, as buybacks have been the main way to return money to shareholders in the U.S.
Large payouts and an over-exposure to high-yielding energy and financials makes the U.K. particularly vulnerable to dividend cuts, according to Citi’s Buckland.
Since the global financial crisis, most of the returns generated by European equities have been linked to dividends. Before the drawdown triggered by the coronavirus outbreak, the MSCI Europe index was up barely 10% since 2000, while its total-return equivalent had risen more than 80%.

""Device & shipping cost are free. Only requirement is that the vents are needed immediately for patients, not stored in a warehouse. Please me or @Tesla know,"" Musk said in a tweet https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1245009716935188481.
Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment on how many ventilators it has to offer, or how the company will prioritize requests.
Governments across the globe have appealed to automakers and aerospace companies help procure or make ventilators and other medical equipment amid a fast-spreading coronavirus outbreak, which has infected more than 777,000 people globally and killed over 37,500.
In United States, states hard hit by the pandemic have pleaded with the Trump administration and manufacturers to speed up production of ventilators to cope with a surge in patients.
Earlier this week,  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) said it will produce 50,000 ventilators over the next 100 days at a plant in Michigan in cooperation with  General Electric  (NYSE:GE)'s healthcare unit, and can then build 30,000 per month as needed to treat patients afflicted with the coronavirus.

133,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 31, 2020 12:00PM ET</span>",Six Assets Rule Them All After Virus Wreaks Havoc Across Markets,"(Bloomberg) -- For one of the most dramatic quarters in market history, the list of winners sure seems run-of-the-mill. Until you scratch the surface.
Treasuries. Gold. Dollars. Bunds. The Swiss franc. Yen. Across 25 major assets, these six are the only ones destined to deliver a positive return for the first three months of the year, according to Bloomberg calculations.
At first glance, it’s a case of old-school havens once again proving their worth, this time in the face of a virus that has brought major economies to a halt and ripped through markets.
But consider: The Treasury market was plagued by liquidity concerns for weeks. Gold volatility hit the highest since the 2008 crisis. The dollar just had one of its worst weeks since 1985. Bunds have been pressured as Europe mulls further stimulus to blunt the impact of the virus, and even joint euro-area bond issuance.
That these assets still come out on top speaks to the scale of the turmoil everywhere else.
The VIX Index, a measure of expected price swings in the S&P 500, is set for its biggest quarterly jump on record as the benchmark U.S. stock gauge is poised to record the worst run since 2008. European equity volatility is also heading for its largest quarterly jump as the Stoxx Europe 600 flirts with the worst performance ever.
But the biggest loser in absolute terms, inevitably, has been oil. In a remarkable series of events, the world’s largest crude suppliers started a price war at the same time as demand cratered thanks to the pandemic. The commodity is facing the worst quarter in history.
Those declines dwarf the losses across stock markets, which are led by a gauge of emerging-market shares, Europe’s benchmark and an index of world equities.

The reports prompted the bank to ""look at how we do business so that we could gain a deeper understanding of what more we can do to root out racism and discrimination,"" co-Chief Executives Gordon Smith and Daniel Pinto wrote in a memo sent to the bank's staff seen by Reuters and verified by a bank spokesman.

""We are looking across the whole firm and at everything we do. We've identified a number of areas that, with enhanced, scaled or new programming or processes, would serve to improve our culture in important ways,"" Smith and Pinto wrote.
The bank will simplify the process through which employees file customer complaints and flag serious concerns to senior management. 
It is also re-evaluating the qualification requirements for new products and benefits and will strengthen tools bank managers use to monitor employees who have discretion over which customers get access to certain products and benefits. 

The bank also committed to recruiting more diverse staff and said it will expand assessment programs for managers that evaluate how successfully they recruit for and hire diverse employees in management.

138,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 31, 2020 11:29AM ET</span>",Stocks - Wall Street Edges Higher as End of Quarter Approaches,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets clawed their way into the green Friday, the last day of a quarter that is set to be their worst in over a decade, as investors weighed the economic damage from the coronavirus pandemic against hopes for further fiscal stimulus and signs some measures against the disease may be slowing the spread.
By 11:25 AM ET (1525 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.16%. The S&P 500 and the NASDAQ Composite were up 0.11% and 0.7%, respectively.
Positive overnight news flow from the Chinese economy and from some of Europe's latest Covid-19 figures was further helped after Dr. Anthony Facui, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told CNN there was a glimmer of hope social distancing in the U.S. was starting to slow the spread of Covid-19.
That was countered by new forecasts for the U.S. economy from Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), whose analysts said they expect the jobless rate to hit 15% in the second quarter, and gross domestic product to fall by an annualized 34%. 
The warning from Goldman comes two days before the release of the U.S. labor market report for March, which is expected to show a leap in joblessness as a result of the creeping shutdown of factories, restaurants, bars, gyms and other businesses over the month. The same factors will already be on show in Thursday's weekly jobless claims report. Analysts polled by Investing.com predict another 998,000 increase in jobless claims last week.
Also this morning, President Donal Trump tweeted that the U.S. should use low borrowing costs to launch a $2 trillion infrastructure program that would also provide jobs.
Among individual stocks,  Zoom Video Communications  (NASDAQ:ZM) stock was down 3.5% after the New York Times reported that New York Attorney-General Letitia James had written to it to express concern about its data privacy practices, amid reports that the company sent data to Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) without informing users. 
Zoom is currently the best-selling app in the U.S. iStore, reflecting the surge in demand from people forced to work and educate their children from home. It has doubled in value since the Covid-19 outbreak began, and at its peak was worth more than the big four U.S. airline groups combined. 
Elsewhere, Carnival  (NYSE:CCL) rose 9%, reversing early losses, after the cruise line operator unveiled a $6 billion recapitalization plan, of which around one quarter will be in stock, half in three-year senior debt and the rest in convertible notes, also due in 2023. The company has had little option, given its difficulty, as a leisure company, of claiming privileged access to federal funds under the last economic support package.
Tightening financial conditions in the real economy were also on show as Delphi Technologies PLC (NYSE:DLPH) stock fell 19.4% after BorgWarner (NYSE:BWA) threatened to walk away from its agreed merger with the troubled auto parts group. Delphi had drawn down a credit facility to ease an acute cash squeeze, but had breached the terms of the merger deal by failing to get the approval of its larger rival in writing first. BorgWarner stock was up 1.4%.
In the oil patch, oil and gas stocks were generally higher after Presidents Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin made soothing noises about supporting the oil market after a telephone call on Monday. U.S. crude futures rallied 2.8% to $20.66 a barrel. Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) ADRs (NYSE:RDSa) were up 6.4% after the company said it had agreed a new $12 billion bank facility, strengthening hopes that it will pay out its full-year dividend, in full and in cash. Imperial Oil (NYSE:IMO) stock rose 13.2% after the company said it will cut capital spending this year by around one-third to conserve cash."
139,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 31, 2020 11:27AM ET</span>",JPMorgan Asset Management  Says It’s Too Early to Buy Stocks,"(Bloomberg) -- JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Asset Management is cautioning investors against rushing to buy equities because the market remains susceptible to negative developments in the coronavirus crisis.
“I’m not yet confident in advocating overweight risk assets positions because you’re vulnerable in that scenario to a deterioration of the news on the medical front,” said Hugh Gimber, a global market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management, in a phone interview. “The policy measures have helped but they’re not on their own enough for us to call a definitive bottom in this market.”
While global equities rallied last week and on Monday amid optimism that fiscal and monetary support measures can limit the fallout from the pandemic, the situation around the virus remains critical and companies are continuing to slash their earnings outlooks. The full extent of damage to corporate profits remains unknown, making it dangerous to turn risk-on, Gimber said.
The strategist at the $1.9 trillion asset manager is closely monitoring the strength of the labor market in the U.S. and Europe for signs of how quickly the economies will be able to rebound once lockdown measures are lifted. This data can provide a signal to resume buying equities, he said.
During these challenging times, Gimber recommends focusing on quality companies with strong balance sheets and low leverage both in stocks and bonds.
“You want to be investing in companies that have the balance sheet flexibility to be able to handle this short-term hit to activity and come out on the other side the strongest,” he said.
In the bond market, he favors government debt with shorter duration over debt with a longer-term maturity as he sees the gains there as more limited. He’s particularly keen on investment-grade bonds that benefit from the U.S. Federal Reserve’s and other central banks’ purchases and support measures.
He’s much more cautious on high-yield debt issued by companies with weaker balance sheets. “The central banks will help solve the liquidity challenge for corporates, but they can’t help to solve the solvency issue for those more under-pressure names,” Gimber said.
Still, the current level of high-yield bond spreads offers a good entry opportunity for those looking to invest for one or two years because in the short-term, volatility can be significant, he said.

140,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 31, 2020 11:15AM ET</span>",EU states step in where trade credit insurers fear to tread,"By Maya Nikolaeva, Toby Sterling and Alexander Hübner
PARIS/AMSTERDAM/MUNICH (Reuters) - European Union states are giving guarantees to credit insurers in a bid to keep coronavirus-hit companies afloat, as some firms cut cover for trade involving bloc members such as Italy and Spain, sources said.
Without insurance, companies can be reluctant to buy or sell goods or services to others, with a rise in insolvencies expected among European firms forced to halt operations due to lockdowns aimed at slowing the coronavirus pandemic's spread.
Atradius, which like rivals Coface and Euler Hermes sells protection to companies against the risk of default by their customers, forecasts a 2.1% rise in insolvencies in western Europe this year, compared with a 0.2% fall in 2019.
Credit insurers, which are often the frontline for absorbing loan losses, are already lowering credit limits and are heading towards ""withdrawal of coverage for places like Italy and Spain"", one industry source told Reuters.
The $11 billion trade credit insurance sector has a bigger exposure in Europe than in Asia, where the coronavirus pandemic began and where brokers say insurers have withdrawn cover.
When risks of bankruptcies grow, credit insurers tend to reduce coverage for future sales in countries that are most hit.
During the 2008-2009 financial crisis, credit insurers pulled the plug on some clients, such as car manufacturers, prompting governments to adopt some emergency measures.
In France, the finance ministry said credit insurers had vowed not to cut or curtail cover, in return for a reinsurance backstop worth up 10 billion euros to be set up by the end of the week.
And on Tuesday, the French government announced 2 billion euros ($2.2 billion) in short-term aid as part of a package to help French exporters with credit insurance.
""It would be needed to convince credit insurers not to massively reduce the lines, otherwise we will have problems, especially if there is a delay in payments,"" a member of the French association of corporate treasurers, AFTE, said.
AFTE last week said that some of members had reported credit insurers were reducing cover in countries like Italy and Spain.
""I was not satisfied with the situation last week. There were unacceptable blockages that could simply block the financing of our economy,"" French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said on Tuesday when asked about credit insurance.
Italian insurers were aware of an issue with France's Coface, which was reducing cover for credit lines involving Italian counterparts, and were working on possible ways to address it, one industry source told Reuters.
Coface said that it continued to issue guarantees in Spain and Italy, both for domestic and export-oriented clients, to prevent risks for them in a deteriorating economy.
Euler Hermes said that the basis for insurance was always based on an individual analysis of a company.
Atradius declined to comment. 
UNIFORM SYSTEM
Robert Nijhout, executive director at the International Credit Insurance & Surety Association (ICISA), said discussions were taking place about the issue at national and EU level.
There had been no request for governments to support the credit insurers, with talks aimed at avoiding a situation where the industry has to pull cover on companies if things do not improve in the next few months, Nijhout added.
Europe lacks coordination on supporting export-oriented companies, with each country having its own approach, something Nijhout said ICISA had asked for both the European Commission and European insurance regulator EIOPA to address.
""Our call is for a uniform system as much as possible and a system where the existing cover can stay in place,"" he added.
In Germany, insurers are also holding talks about state guarantees for commercial credit insurers. In return, the industry would pledge to keep their credit limits, or the maximum amount of risk they accept from a client, stable where possible, a source familiar with the matter said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Turkey's state-owned Halkbank (IS:HALKB) on Tuesday pleaded not guilty to criminal charges in a federal court in Manhattan that it helped Iran evade U.S. sanctions, in a case that has strained relations between the United States and Turkey.
The plea - to charges including conspiracy, bank fraud and money laundering - was entered by the bank's U.S. lawyer at a hearing conducted by telephone conference because of the coronavirus pandemic.
U.S. prosecutors have accused Halkbank of using money servicers and front companies in Iran, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates to evade sanctions through sham transactions in gold, food and medicine.
The charges, announced last October, followed related charges brought by prosecutors against nine individuals since 2016.
They included former Halkbank executive Mehmet Hakan Atilla, who was convicted in the same federal court in Manhattan in January 2018 after another defendant, wealthy Turkish-Iranian gold trader Reza Zarrab, pleaded guilty and testified against him.
Atilla returned to Turkey last year after leaving prison, and became general manager of the Istanbul Stock Exchange.

The case is U.S. v. Halkbank, U.S. District Court, Southern (NYSE:SO) District of New York, No. 15-cr-00867.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve announced Tuesday it was delaying for six months new rules dictating when a company takes control of a bank and must face stricter oversight.
The rules were due to take effect Wednesday, and now will be inactive until Sept. 30. The regulations are aimed at setting terms for when companies and other investors are considered in control of a bank, which then exposes them to additional banking rules.
The Fed finalized those rules in January, saying at the time it would help clarify what conditions must be met for a bank to be considered under control of a particular entity. Previously, those control decisions were made on a case-by-case basis by Fed supervisors. Fed officials said at the time such clarity could make it simpler for banks to attract investors wary of being exposed to stricter rules, and it could also make it simpler for banks to make investments of their own into companies.

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Latin American companies from oil behemoth Petrobras to cement maker Cemex, facing drastic coronavirus-linked revenue declines, are rushing to draw down credit lines amid a shutdown in local bond markets and a paucity of state aid.
The dash for cash is in line with a broader move by businesses worldwide amid a plunge in demand. But a paucity of quantitative-easing style monetary policies or other state support for companies is emerging as an added regional stress factor.
""In my entire career, I've never seen companies seeking so much money as now. Not even in the 2008 financial crisis,"" said an experienced executive at one of Brazil's top lenders. 
Since concerns about the coronavirus pandemic hit the region, disbursement on revolving credit lines have risen to an average of 65% from a previous 10 percent, said a senior executive at one of the largest U.S. banks in Latin America, adding he expects it to reach 100% in the short term.
Brazil's state-controlled oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA (SA:PETR4) has said it cashed out almost $9 billion from its revolving credit lines and Vale SA (SA:VALE3) has drawn down $5 billion. 
Other regional behemoths such as Mexico's America Movil SAB de CV (MX:AMXL), Cemex (MX:CEMEXCPO) and brewer Ambev (SA:ABEV3) have also drawn billions on their revolving credit lines, according to two sources with knowledge of the matter.
Mexico's petrochemical group Orbia Advance Corp (MX:ORBIA) said late last week it was drawing down $1 billion of its revolving credit line as well. Media company Televisa drew $600 million.
Cemex Group confirmed in a statement to Reuters it has drawn on existing lines of credit to improve its liquidity and is also weighing whether to delay some planned capital expenditures. Ambev said it continues to evaluate opportunities to boost its liquidity, despite having ended 2019 with 12 billion reais in cash. America Movil did not reply to requests for comment. 
Companies seeking new credit lines include poultry exporter BRF SA (SA:BRFS3), which is looking for 2 billion reais, and airline Azul (N:AZUL), which did not disclose the amount it is seeking in additional borrowing. 
The Brazilian subsidiary of  Fiat  Chrysler SpA (MI:FCHA) is also seeking additional credit lines, one source with knowledge of the matter said. Fiat said through a spokesman that it is aiming to ""ensure access to credit lines when necessary.""
Smaller companies that lack access to revolving credit lines are rushing to get bank loans, while also cutting investment plans and postponing dividend payments.
Around half of 245 Brazilian listed companies analyzed by consultancy Economatica have enough cash to sustain operations without revenue for three months, but around 25% will run out of cash in less than a month. 
Banks are adding pressure on companies, demanding higher rates and extending shorter maturities on loans. One of Brazil's biggest lenders has set a maximum term for new credits of one year, compared to more than six years before the coronavirus outbreak, an industry source said.
A partner at a private equity fund in Brazil said one of its portfolio companies had been paying Brazil's interbank benchmark rate, known as CDI, plus 1% for a six-year loan before the pandemic. When the company recently sought an additional loan, the rate had soared to CDI plus 5% for a two-year loan. It accepted the terms anyway.
""I see new loans as an insurance policy now,"" the private equity partner said. ""Despite soaring prices, we prefer to cash out because we don't know what will happen next.""
Fearful of potential bankruptcies, local and international banks are not extending loans to Latin American airlines or travel agencies, the senior U.S. banker added.
Reacting to the lack of private credit, Brazilian development bank BNDES said on Sunday it will line up emergency financing for airlines in April. 
But Brazilian measures have often been slow and sometimes ineffective. A first central bank move to reduce capital required in lending failed to boost credit and led the regulator to implement further steps. 
The central bank will provide liquidity to banks that acquire corporate bonds and is seeking authority to buy such debt directly, emulating the U.S. Fed. 
Brazil's Treasury and lenders Itau Unibanco Holding SA, Banco Bradesco SA and  Banco Santander  (MC:SAN) Brasil SA also promised to lend 40 billion reais ($7.8 billion) to fund the payroll of small companies. 
Even so, smaller listed and private companies that were relying on the sale of securitized credit to Brazilian asset-backed funds known as FDICs, are finding the market is frozen for companies in all industries.
""Mid-sized companies relied on receivables to get credit, and as their cash flow becomes unpredictable, it has been much harder to get financing"" said lawyer Luiz Meneghini Souza, partner at Souza Mello Torres law firm.
Aid has also been slow to come in Mexico, although banks there have offered clients deferred payments on loans at the finance ministry's recommendation. Business groups are also lobbying the government to temporarily suspend or defer taxes. 
The country was downgraded by Standard & Poor's on March 26 due to the fall in oil prices.

152,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 31, 2020 09:55AM ET</span>",Rolls-Royce targets in jeopardy as pandemic brings air travel slump,"LONDON (Reuters) - British aero-engine maker Rolls-Royce (L:RR) will likely have to slash its 2020 cash flow target after airline customers parked hundreds of planes due to the coronavirus pandemic, analysts said.
Rolls last updated the market at the end of February, when it forecast 2020 free cash flow of 1 billion pounds ($1.2 billion), excluding any material impact from COVID-19.
The company is paid by airlines based on how many hours its engines fly, and since its update air travel has slumped. 
Jefferies analyst Sandy Morris said he could see free cash flow drop into negative territory this year, even with the firm's 400 million pound cost cuts, based on flying hours which could be down about two-thirds for four months of 2020.
But he said the company could withstand that. ""Given that Rolls-Royce started the year with 1.36 billion pounds of cash it's not as hamstrung as I think some people portray,"" said Morris, who rates the company a ""buy"". 
Vertical Research Partners analyst Robert Stallard, who rates Rolls ""sell"", said airlines would likely retire many older aircraft earlier than expected, hitting revenue Rolls earns from spare parts and servicing in its aftermarket business.
""While this downcycle is set to hurt all aerospace suppliers, Rolls looks particularly vulnerable in our view. This is a company that was not in the best of financing shape before this downcycle hit,"" he said. 
A Rolls-Royce spokesman said the company had a robust financial position with 7 billion pounds of liquidity at the end of 2019, including a 2.5 billion pound credit facility. 
""We are closely monitoring the situation and taking prudent measures to conserve cash, such as reducing or deferring discretionary spend. Our good starting position and the measures we have taken, and will continue to take, give us confidence in the ongoing financial resilience of our business,"" he said.
 General Electric  Co's (N:GE) aviation unit, a rival to Rolls in making engines for Boeing (NYSE:BA) and Airbus aircraft, said last week it would cut its U.S. workforce by about 10%. 
Rolls declined to comment on whether it would be furloughing staff under a British government job retention scheme. 
According to analysis by travel data firm Cirium, flying hours on Rolls-Royce powered flights reduced from 20,421 hours on Jan. 3 to 4,664 on March 29.
Rolls started this year having got to grips with a long-running engine problem and having made progress with a multi-year turnaround plan which had seen it cut costs, and focus on raising free cash flow to 873 million pounds for 2019 from a nadir of 100 million pounds for 2016.
It relies on aerospace for just over half of its 15 billion pounds of annual revenues, deriving the rest from its defense and power systems businesses.
The company suspended production in its British aero-engine factories for a week last week, and the facilities are likely to return with reduced activity.
Shares in the company have dropped 45% in the last month, hitting their lowest level for more than 10 years. 
As for the timing of any market update, Morris said Rolls' contracts with airlines meant the reduction in flying hours may not have come through yet, but it would. ""At some point there will be a reckoning,"" he said.

The department said air carriers that fly between cities five days a week or more would need to provide at least one flight per day five times a week between the points. 
For those with fewer than one a day five times a week, they would only need to fly once per week. For cities where there are multiple airports, carriers could consolidate operations at a single airport. 
The department said airlines could seek waivers for specific flights saying that ""even with these reduced service levels, it may not be practicable for covered carriers to serve all points previously served.""

157,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 31, 2020 09:18AM ET</span>",ECB Steps Up Pressure on Bank Dividends to Weather Virus Crisis,"(Bloomberg) -- The European Central Bank increased the pressure on banks to curb dividends and bonuses during the coroniavirus crisis, saying it could impose legally binding measures if lenders don’t fall in line.
The ECB expects all banks to follow its recommendation to delay dividends until at least October, Andrea Enria, the institution’s top banking watchdog, told Bloomberg TV on Tuesday. While he didn’t single out any banks, it was a clear warning to firms that have been slow to act, especially French banks that have promised large sums to shareholders.
The increasingly hard line from the ECB underscores that regulators and governments want banks to do their part after offering them unprecedented support in the form of loan guarantees and temporarily allowing them to tap capital buffers. While shareholders stand to benefit if banks survive the economic standstill, the loss of dividends is a major setback in an industry that has long lagged behind the wider stock market.
“We want to instill in banks a strong commitment to preserve every euro of capital that could be useful to lend to the economy,” Enria said. “If banks decide not to comply with the recommendations, we will decide whether to take other measures; we can also take legally binding measures if need be.”
Tougher Line
That marks an escalation from last week, when Enria encouraged European lenders to hold off paying dividends until at least October but didn’t suggest that the ECB may force them to act. While several banks announced on Monday that they would follow his recommendation, others are still thinking it through.
French Lenders  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) SA and  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) SA are aware of Enria’s advice and are looking into it, their spokespeople have said. Natixis SA’s board of directors will meet to consider the matter this week, a spokesman said.  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) SA’s board, which next meets on April 14, would have to propose any such changes to the bank’s shareholders, it said. The small French banks who own a majority stake in Credit Agricole use the payouts to help fund the local economy, a spokeswoman said.
“I am very pleased to see that banks are reacting very positively,” he said. “I think that’s an important step for their own reputation for showing corporate responsibility in a difficult time for our economies.”
The ECB said last week that halting the return of funds to shareholders would allow banks to retain 30 billion euros ($33 billion) of capital which they could use to lend more or absorb losses if credit turns bad.
Enria also said that he is encouraging banks to show moderation on staff bonuses, although that’s less important than dividends given the amount of capital involved.
“Banks, shareholders, managers and key risk takers should also take part in the rethink of where we are right now,” he said. “Showing restraint on bonuses also means paying them in shares or share-linked instruments,” he said.
Freeing Capital
Earlier this month, the ECB freed up 120 billion euros of capital by allowing banks to dip into some of their buffers and use subordinated debt to help fill a key requirement.
The ECB has no plans to suspend payments on those types of notes and banks’ capital levels are still “very far” from where the bonds would be wiped out or converted to equity, Enria said.
Enria said it is important for investors to understand that there’s no stigma for banks who tap into their capital and liquidity.
“These conservation measures are not reflecting a specific fragility that we see right now in the banking sector, it’s really aimed at maximizing the firepower of banks to support their customers,” Enria said. “There is a ratcheting up in the demand for credit from corporates, especially those that are probably meeting some difficulties in terms of the freeze in their revenue.”

SHENZHEN, China (Reuters) - Huawei warned on Tuesday that 2020 would be its most difficult year yet due to American trade restrictions which dealt a blow to its overseas sales in 2019, and predicted the Chinese government would retaliate against the United States.
The world's largest maker of telecoms equipment issued the warning as it reported its weakest annual profit growth in three years. It said Beijing could hit back against U.S. measures to restrict chip sales to Huawei, by restricting sales of American products in China and by shifting to alternative suppliers in China and South Korea.
""The Chinese government will not just stand by and watch Huawei be slaughtered on the chopping board,"" Chairman Eric Xu told reporters at the launch of Huawei's annual report.
""Why wouldn't the Chinese government ban the use of 5G chips or 5G chip-powered base stations, smartphones and other smart devices provided by American companies, for cybersecurity reasons?"" 
The United States alleges the Chinese government could use Huawei's equipment to spy, an accusation rejected by the company.
Washington placed Huawei on a blacklist in May last year, citing national security concerns, restricting sales of U.S.-made goods to the company. U.S. President Donald Trump's administration is also preparing further measures that will seek to restrict the supply of chips to the company, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters this month.
One of the sources said the rule-change is aimed at curbing sales of chips to Huawei by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TW:2330), the world's largest contract chip maker and a major producer of chips for Huawei's HiSilicon division.
""Even if this situation you mentioned happened, Huawei and also other Chinese companies can choose to buy chipsets from Samsung (KS:005930) from Korea, MTK from Taiwan, and [Unisoc] in China, and use those companies to develop chips,"" Huawei's Xu said.
Xu, however, predicted 2020 would be the most difficult year yet for the company because of the U.S. measures and warned that further export restrictions could destroy global tech supply chains.
SMARTPHONES STRONG
Huawei Technologies [HWT.UL] said net profit for 2019 came in at 62.7 billion yuan ($8.9 billion), up 5.6% - its weakest growth in three years, and down from 25% jump a year earlier.
Its carrier business, which includes 5G mobile network equipment, saw sales rise just 3.8%.
Liang Hua, chairman of the board, said the company would have to adapt to the U.S. restrictions as well as the coronavirus pandemic.
Overall revenue rose 19% to 858.8 billion yuan, helped by a 34% jump in sales for its consumer business unit, which includes smartphones.
That was mainly driven by China, where sales surged 36.2% to 506.7 billion yuan. In contrast, revenue from the Asia-Pacific region excluding China fell 13.9%, while in Europe and the Middle East sales grew just 0.7%. 
Huawei dominated smartphone sales in China, taking a 38.5% share of the market in 2019 compared with 27% a year earlier, according to research firm Canalys. This was in part due to a boost in nationalist sentiment after the company came under increasing pressure from the United States.
It spent 15.3% of its revenue, or 131.7 billion yuan, in research and development last year. Cash flow from operating activities jumped by more than one fifth to 91.4 billion yuan, thanks to a strong performance in its home market.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Google (O:GOOGL) on Tuesday defended the impartiality of its search results after users in Japan seeking to corroborate rumors of an imminent state of emergency declaration by the government were met with no results on its website. 
Climbing coronavirus cases in Tokyo have seen politicians call for residents to reduce social mixing and have led to a slew of messages circulating on social media asserting a broader lockdown is imminent. 
The government on Monday denied it was preparing to lock down the country on April 1 as rumored earlier. 
Google users found that using the search term ""state of emergency declaration April 2"" in Japanese was returning no results - an unusual outcome on the world's top search site and sparking further speculation of censorship by the company.
The internet giant said on its Twitter account that it is investigating and that ""its algorithm is designed to automatically produce impartial results and avoid being impacted by the aims and prejudices of particular individuals and groups."" 

Results for the search term were appearing on Tuesday evening.

162,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 31, 2020 07:15AM ET</span>",U.S. regional carriers ask govt to prioritize them when awarding payroll grants,"By David Shepardson and Tracy Rucinski
WASHINGTON/CHICAGO (Reuters) - U.S. regional carriers asked the U.S. Treasury Department on Monday to prioritize assistance for them when awarding $25 billion in cash grants to help the struggling industry stay afloat, according to a letter seen by Reuters.
The letter was sent by the Regional Airline Association, which represents around 20 firms that operate short-haul routes for mainline carriers  American Airlines Group  Inc (O:AAL), Delta Air Lines Inc (N:DAL) and United Airlines Holdings Inc (O:UAL).
Their business has tumbled in line with sharp flight reductions by the large carriers as the coronavirus decimates travel demand. The pandemic spurred Congress to pass a relief package worth roughly $50 billion for the sector last week, half in the form of payroll grants.
The association suggested the Treasury Department could give all carriers at least $250 million and divide the remaining funds among qualifying carriers according to their payroll needs.
""This ensures the smallest carriers, with the most vulnerable employees and which serve the most isolated communities, receive adequate assistance,"" the association said in the letter addressed to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao.
American Airlines, the U.S. carrier with the largest workforce, has said it is eligible for up to $6 billion in grants.
The regional carriers also asked that they not be required to ""provide warrants, equity, notes or other financial instruments"" as compensation for the cash assistance.
U.S. Treasury Department guidelines issued on Monday say carriers seeking grants must identify financial instruments as possible compensation for the cash grants. 
Most regional airlines are not publicly traded and cannot take on debt or access capital markets.
If those conditions were applied, they would could not receive the grants and would have to ""immediately furlough tens of thousands"" of employees in a move that would risk service to vulnerable small communities, the association's CEO, Faye Malarkey Black, said in the letter.
U.S. regional airlines directly employ 70,000 people, operate 41% of all U.S. departures and served over 160 million passengers last year. 
Of the regional carriers, only  SkyWest  Inc (O:SKYW) and Mesa Air Group (O:MESA) are listed. Two regional carriers, Trans States and Compass, have already said they plan to shut down due to the pandemic.
American, United and Delta have relied on regional carriers, which have a lower cost structure, to fly many of the domestic routes that take passengers into large hubs for international departures. But the three majors are now only flying a fraction of their normal schedules.
American, for example, is ending its regional flying out of Los Angeles starting April 7. On a peak day in August 2019, it had about 70 daily regional flights out of LAX, an official said.
Under the law approved last week, Chao must determine what reasonable air services carriers receiving grants or loans should be required to maintain.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are set to open mixed Tuesday, amid reports that Washington is already preparing another package of economic support measures, only days after enacting the last one.
Bloomberg cited unnamed sources as putting the size of the new bill at around $600 billion, compared to $2.2 trillion for the 'phase 3' package passed last week.
“The fourth bill would be about recovery,” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told reporters on a Monday press call. “We would like to see in what comes next something that has always been nonpartisan ... and that would be an infrastructure piece that takes us into the future.”
The need for further economic help was laid bare by the latest research note from Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS). 
The U.S. investment bank expects the U.S. economy to shrink an annualized 34% in the second quarter, compared with an earlier estimate of 24%, economists led by Jan Hatzius wrote in a report. Unemployment will soar to 15% by mid-year, up from a previous forecast of 9%, they wrote.
The U.S. is rapidly taking over from Europe as the global epicenter of the Covid-19 pandemic, with 164,610 confirmed cases and a death toll of 3,170 that is still rising quickly. New York City alone has 67,000 cases and has registered 1,342 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins.
Maryland, Virginia and Washington D.C. all enacted tighter restrictions on non-essential movement and business on Monday.
At 7:15 AM ET (1115 GMT), futures for the S&P 500 traded 8 points, or 0.3%, lower, futures for the Nasdaq were flat, while the Dow futures contract fell 33 points, or 0.2%. 
Despite the recent rally, the slump from the mid-February record highs has set the Dow Jones Industrial Average on course for its worst first quarter ever, while the S&P 500 is on track for its worst since 1938. The tech-heavy Nasdaq is set to close out its worst first three months of the year since 2008.
China's official Purchasing Managers' Index rose to 52 in March, above the 50-point mark that separates monthly growth from contraction, rebounding from a plunge to a record low of 35.7 in February.
At the same time, Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) stated that it expects vehicle sales in China, the world's largest car market, to quadruple in March, pointing to a recovery following the coronavirus pandemic.
News indicating that China, where the coronavirus pandemic started, may be getting on top of the outbreak has buoyed spirits as it gives an expected time frame for investors to consider.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Warehouse, delivery and retail gig workers in the United States went on strike on Monday to call attention to safety and wage concerns for people laboring through the coronavirus crisis. 
Among the strikers were some of the roughly 200,000 workers at U.S. online grocery delivery company Instacart, according to strike organizer Gig Workers Collective, founded earlier this year by Instacart worker Vanessa Bain.
Fifteen workers at an Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) warehouse in Staten Island, New York, also walked off the job on Monday following reports of COVID-19 among the facility's staff.
Amazon said later it fired an employee who helped organize the action for alleged violations of his employment, including leaving a paid quarantine to participate in the demonstration. New York's attorney general said her office was ""considering all legal options"" in response to the firing, citing the right to organize in the state.
Workers have also protested in other countries. Dozens of Amazon workers at a facility near Florence, Italy, went on strike on Monday. 
French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said last week that pressure on Amazon employees to work despite inadequate protections was ""unacceptable."" 
From delivery drivers to grocery store clerks, shelf stockers and fast-food employees, workers have kept food and essential goods flowing to people who have been told by their governments to stay home to stop the spread of coronavirus.
More than 738,500 people have been infected across the world and about 35,000 have died, according to a Reuters tally. 
Amazon, the world's largest online retailer, said it has taken ""extreme measures"" to clean buildings and obtain safety gear and that ""the vast majority of employees continue to show up and do the heroic work of delivering for customers every day."" Less than half a percent of its more than 5,000-person workforce at the Staten Island site protested, it said.
In statements on Monday, Amazon disputed comments from one of the striking Staten Island employees, Christian Smalls, who had accused the company of mishandling warehouse operations after a confirmed case of coronavirus.
Amazon said Smalls was on a paid quarantine after having close contact with a diagnosed worker, and had ""received multiple warnings for violating social distancing guidelines,"" leading to his dismissal.
Smalls responded in a statement distributed by Athena, a labor and activist coalition.
""I’m going to keep speaking up. My colleagues in New York and all around the country are going to keep speaking up. We won’t stop until Amazon provides real protections for our health and safety,"" he said.
Letitia James, the New York Attorney General, issued a statement calling the firing ""disgraceful"" and also asked the National Labor Relations Board to investigate. Amazon did not immediately return a request for comment on the attorney general's statement.
HAZARD PAY, SANITIZER
San Francisco-based Instacart - which lets customers place online orders from grocers, retailers like Costco Wholesale Corp (O:COST) and CVS Health Corp's (N:CVS) CVS Pharmacy - said in a statement that the strike of its contractors had ""absolutely no impact to Instacart's operations.""
On Monday, Instacart said it had 40% more shoppers on the platform than on the same day last week and sold more groceries in the last 72 hours than ever before.
""The health and safety of our entire community - shoppers, customers, and employees - is our first priority,"" it said in a statement.
It was not clear how many Instacart workers were participating in the strike, Bain told Reuters. Bain has created a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) group with 15,000 members. She said hundreds more have reached out to her in light of Monday's campaign. 
In posts on social media, people who said they were Instacart workers demanded hazard pay to account for the dangers of working while most people stay home to comply with state, local and federal government guidance.
They also asked for the company to provide hand sanitizer, disinfectant wipes and soap to clean their cell phones, cars and shopping carts. 
""We don't have to have 100 percent participation to ... force Instacart to maneuver on these issues,"" Bain said in a phone interview. 
Instacart said on March 23 that it wanted to hire another 300,000 gig workers because of a surge in demand.
Staff in one supermarket of French retailer  Carrefour  (PA:CARR) will receive protective masks after some walked out over health risks, a union said on Monday.

Employees of McDonald's Corp (N:MCD), as well as people who said they worked at Walmart Inc (N:WMT), supermarket chain Harris Teeter, Waffle House, Family Dollar and Food Lion, boycotted work at North Carolina locations on Friday.

LONDON (Reuters) - The world's biggest advertising company WPP (L:WPP) has pulled its dividend and share buyback and withdrawn its 2020 guidance after the coronavirus pandemic sparked the most uncertain time in its 35-year history. 
The owner of the Ogilvy, Grey and Hill+Knowlton agencies said its actions, along with a cost cutting drive, would save around 2 billion pounds in 2020 to see it through a downturn in client spending.
Chief Executive Mark Read said fallout from the coronavirus outbreak had been much more rapid than from the 2008 economic crash, hitting different sectors more quickly and leaving many companies with zero revenue and no reason to spend on marketing. 
""This is the period with the greatest uncertainty,"" Read told Reuters. ""We don't know yet whether it will be the worst.""
The pandemic, which has shut down the global economy with shopping districts deserted, sports fixtures cancelled and millions of people left idle, has come at a difficult time for the company that was founded by Martin Sorrell.
In the middle of a three-year turnaround plan designed to simplify the sprawling company, trading outside of China had improved in the first two months of the year but that came to an end in March. 
In a sign of what could be ahead, the British company said organic sales had fallen by 16% in Greater China in January and February and while life was slowly returning to normal there, consumer spending remained depressed. 
Rivals IPG (N:IPG) and Publicis (PA:PUBP) have already pulled their earnings guidance for the year.
CONSERVING CASH 
To conserve cash WPP has frozen new hires, reviewed freelance expenditure, stopped discretionary costs such as travel and postponed salary increases. It will also save more than 100 million pounds assigned for property and IT costs. 
Members of the executive committee and board have also taken a 20% salary cut for an initial period of three months.
The group, with 2019 revenue of 13 billion pounds, also had 3 billion pounds of cash at the end of 2019, and additional liquidity. 
""The companies that go into this in the strongest position financially will come out of it in the strongest position,"" Read said.
WPP said it was producing health campaigns for governments and clients around the world including in Britain where it launched an information service on WhatsApp. Public relations and public affairs advice was in strong demand. 
Some clients, particularly in Asia, are working on rebranding while others are shifting media spend from cinemas and outdoor to digital and TV, and pushing it back to later in the year. 
Analysts at Citi said the measures were prudent and the 16% drop in China not quite as bad as feared. Shares in the group were up 8%. ""The good news is we will come out the other side and at the end of the day we'll be alright,"" Read said.

Following government recommendations announced by the Danish business minister last week, the Danish Financial Supervisory Authority on Monday urged banks not to pay out dividends or buy back shares.
Elsewhere in Europe, the European Central Bank told euro zone lenders last week to skip dividends and share buybacks until at least October.
Denmark's third largest bank,  Jyske Bank  (CO:JYSK), said on Tuesday it would discontinue it remaining buyback program, while  Sydbank 's board (CO:SYDB) decided not recommend a dividend payout. 
Separately on Monday,  Ringkjoebing Landbobank  (CO:RILBA) suspended its remaining share buyback program.

However, Denmark's biggest lender,  Danske Bank  (CO:DANSKE) has yet to announce whether it will skip dividend payments this year. Last week it said it would reassess its dividend proposal after having postponed its annual general meeting last month.

Several states have stepped in to help airlines hammered by the coronavirus pandemic that has virtually halted international travel, with the United States offering $58 billion in aid.
Emirates, which suspended passenger operations this month, has temporarily cut staff wages by as much as half due to the impact of the coronavirus outbreak on its business. 
It only operates international flights, and most of its passengers transit through Dubai.
""The Government of Dubai is committed to fully supporting @Emirates at this critical time and will inject equity into the company,"" Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed al-Maktoum wrote on Twitter.
""@Emirates, our national carrier, positioned Dubai as a global travel hub and has great strategic value as one of the main pillars of Dubai’s economy, as well as the wider economy of the UAE (United Arab Emirates),"" he added. 
The government will announce further details about the equity injection and more measures soon, he said. 
Emirates Group, a state holding company that counts the airline among its assets, had 100,000 employees, including more than 21,000 cabin crew and 4,000 pilots, at end March 2019, the close of its last financial year.
Its long-serving president Tim Clark is due to step down in June.

It was not immediately clear if the government would provide support to fellow Dubai state carrier flydubai, which on Monday said it would temporarily reduce wages for three months.

169,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 31, 2020 05:22AM ET</span>","StockBeat: Ericsson, Imperial Say Those Precious 3 Little Words","By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- The sweetest three words in a stock investor’s ear right now? ‘No material impact.’
Sweet, because rare. The morning run of regulatory news releases has become a grimly repetitive series of downgrades and profit warnings, but two big names bucked the trend on Tuesday. albeit for different reasons.
Swedish telecoms networking equipment maker Ericsson (ST:ERICb) rose 2.9% to its highest in over a month after chief executive Borje Ekholm gave an upbeat assessment of the company’s outlook.  At the end of the Stoxx 600 index’s worst quarter in over a decade, Ericsson (BS:ERICAs) stock is a clear outperformer, having lost only 1.0%.
""So far, we have not seen any material impact on our business, but we are closely following the developments in society,"" Ekholm said in a video link uploaded to the company’s website, replacing the usual address to shareholders at an annual meeting curtailed because of Covid-19 fears.
Ericsson's outlook has brightened considerably as U.S. sanctions against competitor Huawei have raised the risk of doing business with Ericsson’s biggest competitor.
“Last year we talked about switching on 5G globally. Today, we can say that we have succeeded,” Ekholm said. “Right now we have 86 commercial 5G agreements and 27 live networks in 4 continents. Ericsson is leading the 5G development. I see no one in front of us.”
He added that the 5G market is growing faster than most analysts have expected and said Ericsson is “well positioned” to capture this growth – a nice consolation for shareholders missing out on one of the year’s best smorgasbords.
Ericsson’s gain is carriers’ pain, of course. A number have grumbled at higher cost and less choice as a result of government action to limit Huawei’s presence in the new industry standard. But even gift-wrapped opportunities need to be actively exploited, and Ericsson has done just that, while its big European rival Nokia (HE:NOKIA) has stumbled from one mishap to the next. Nokia stock is down 14% year-to-date and 45% over the last 12 months.
Elsewhere in the happy lands of ‘no material impact’. U.K.-based tobacco giant Imperial Brands PLC (LON:IMB) stock soared 13% after it said current trading was “in line with expectations.”  Looks like nobody chose the wrong week to give up smoking. The FTSE 100 rose a more modest 1.9%.
Amid a constant drumbeat of downgrades and profit warnings, Imperial’s statement also cheered investors by completely leaving out the words “suspend” and “dividend”, on a day that the 72 pence final payout was due for distribution.
In a world where Big Oil’s revenues are collapsing and the breweries and distillers are suffering from bar closures the world over, investors can be relieved to see there’s still one vice sector that can be relied on.
Imperial also said it had agreed a new 3.5 billion-pound revolving credit facility with 20 banks. That replaces an earlier 3 billion-pound credit line – further reassurance for investors amid pervasive fears of strained liquidity."

Investing.com - European stock markets pushed higher Tuesday, lifted by signs of an economic stabilization in Asia. The gains remain tentative, however, as the coronavirus remains a serious threat in the region.
China's official Purchasing Managers' Index rose to 52 in March, above the 50-point mark that separates monthly growth from contraction, rebounding from a plunge to a record low of 35.7 in February .
Welcome as this is, economists are still forecasting a steep contraction in China's first-quarter gross domestic product, the first such contraction in three decades.
At 03:35 ET (0735 GMT), the U.K.'s FTSE index traded 2.5% higher, France's CAC 40 was up 1.8%, while the DAX rose 2.3%. The broader based Stoxx 600 Europe index climbed 2%.
Italy, the epicenter of the outbreak in Europe, announced Monday that it would be extending its nationwide coronavirus lockdown measures until at least Easter. Overall numbers of new infections continue to rise daily, although the rate of increase appears to have plateaued in recent days, as has the mortality rate.. 
Italy has been shut down for three weeks now, and its restrictions were set to be lifted on Friday. It has become the world’s hardest hit country in terms of number of deaths - with more than 11,500 passing away - around a third of all global fatalities. 
The situation in Spain is almost as bad, while France has reported its highest coronavirus death toll in 24 hours, with 418 deaths on Tuesday to take the country’s total to 3,024. 
The data barrage continues in Europe Tuesday, with March inflation data for the region expected at 5 AM ET (0900 GMT). However, of the most interest is likely to be the German March unemployment data at 3:55 AM ET, given the economic slowdown in place to combat the virus outbreak.
In corporate news, shares in WPP (LON:WPP) climbed over 5% despite saying it was pulling its dividend and share buyback and withdrawing its guidance for 2020, citing the coronavirus outbreak. The ad giant also launched a cost cutting drive, identifying up to 800 million pounds that can be saved in 2020.
Shares in Ericsson (BS:ERICAs) climbed 3% after the Swedish telecom equipment maker’s CEO Borje Ekholm said Tuesday that the company had seen no material impact on its business from the global coronavirus outbreak.
Shares in JC Decaux (PA:JCDX) rose over 6% after the French advertising group confirmed that it is planning to buy a 23% minority stake in the Hong Kong-listed outdoor advertising company Clear Media.
Oil markets rebounded after recent sharp losses Tuesday, but the outlook remained grim as the pandemic continued to hurt demand while the market was still oversupplied as a price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia remained unresolved.
At 3:45 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 5.3% higher at $21.16 a barrel. The international benchmark Brent contract rose 1.9% to $26.92.

SYDNEY/HONG KONG (Reuters) - Asian shares were set to close out a calamitous quarter by eking out a small rally on Tuesday as factory data from China held out the hope of a revival in activity, even as much of the rest of the world shut down.
China's official manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI) bounced to 52.0 in March, up from a record-low 35.7 in February and topping forecasts of 45.0.
Analysts cautioned the underlying activity probably remained well below par as the improvement measures the net balance of firms reporting an expansion or contraction. China's National Bureau of Statistics also warned that the rebound didn't signal a stabilization in activity, and was partly due to the very low base in February. 
""The fact that the numbers were not in the 60s shows that this is not going to be a V shaped recovery,"" said Cliff Tan East Asia head of global markets research at MUFG. 
The number was enough of a relief though to help MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan (MIAPJ0000PUS) rise 0.94%. That still left it down 22% for the quarter, its worst performance since 2008.
Gains were modest at best. Shanghai blue chips (CSI300) rose 0.4% and South Korea (KS11) 1.87%. Japan's Nikkei (N225) eased 1%, to be down 20% since the start of the year.
E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 (ESc1) were flat, EUROSTOXX 50 futures (STXEc1) rose 0.7% while FTSE futures (FFIc1) fell 0.25%.
Healthcare had led Wall Street higher, with the Dow (DJI) ending Monday up 3.19%, while the S&P 500 (SPX) gained 3.35% and the Nasdaq (IXIC) 3.62%. 
News on the coronavirus remained grim but radical stimulus steps by governments and central banks have at least provided some comfort to economies.
Infections in hard-hit Italy slowed a little, but the government still extended its lockdown to mid-April. California reported a steep rise in people being hospitalized, while Washington state told people to stay at home.
Trade ministers from the Group of 20 major economies agreed on Monday to keep their markets open and ensure the flow of vital medical supplies.
OIL OVERWHELMED
Portfolio management also played a part in the forex market where many fund managers found themselves over-hedged on their U.S. equity holdings given the sharp fall in values seen this month, leading them to buy back dollars.
That saw the euro ease back to $1.1015 (EUR=), from a top of $1.143 on Monday, while the dollar index bounced to 99.34 (=USD), from a trough of 98.330. 
""Month‑ and quarter‑end rebalancing amid relatively thin liquidity was the major driver of currency markets in the Asia session,"" said analysts at CBA in an note. 
Demand for dollars from Japanese funds saw the dollar inch up to 108.45 yen , though it remained some way from last week's peak at 111.71.
Oil prices steadied, after diving to the lowest in almost 18 years on Monday as lockdowns for the virus squeezed demand even as Saudi Arabia and Russia vied to pump more product. 
U.S. crude added $1.12 to $21.2, while Brent crude futures gained 28 cents to $23.01 a barrel.
In a new twist, U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin agreed during a phone call on Monday to have their top energy officials meet to discuss slumping prices.
""However, the reality is that the level damage to demand is likely to overwhelm any production cut agreement between major producers,"" wrote analysts at ANZ in a note.
""The lockdown of cities around the world and the shutdown of the aviation industry will cause a fall in demand the industry has never seen before."" 
In the gold market all the talk has been of a rush of demand for the physical product amid shortages in coins and small bars. Flows into gold-backed ETFs have ballooned by $13 billion so far this year, the most since 2004.

The metal was holding at $1,613 an ounce , well up from a low of $1,450 touched early in the month.

LONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Global mergers and acquisitions activity plunged 28% in the first quarter to its lowest level since 2016 as the devastating economic effects of the coronavirus pandemic took hold in March, compounding a slow start to the year for dealmakers.
Deal activity in the United States dropped by half to $252 billion in the first three months from a year ago, driving global volumes down to $698 billion from $964 billion in the first quarter of 2019, according to Refinitiv data. Asia volumes dropped 17% year-on-year to $142.9 billion.
Europe saw its deal volume more than double to $232 billion thanks to a handful of mega-deals clinched just weeks before the virus started battering the continent's economies.
With large swathes of the globe shut down, the M&A pipeline remains patchy and likely to be dominated by rescue deals, restructurings and nationalizations as governments and central banks try to shore the economy up.
""This crisis is unique. It is something that our generation has never witnessed before,"" said Luigi de Vecchi, chairman of EMEA banking capital markets advisory at  Citigroup  (NYSE:C).
""When stock markets tumble 30% you need to hope to renegotiate a deal if you have the contractual ability to do so. However, if you haven't reached an agreement you are likely to delay the signing until you have better visibility,"" he said.
Russia used its National Wealth Fund (NWF) to finance this quarter's biggest deal - the $39 billion purchase of the country's largest lender Sberbank (MM:SBER).
Other big deals included insurance broker Aon's (N:AON) $30 billion all-stock takeover of rival Willis Towers Watson (O:WLTW) and the $18 billion private equity-led buyout of Thyssenkrupp's (DE:TKAG) elevators business.
""We have seen the number of deals announced globally drop 43% year-over-year in the last two weeks,"" said Bank of America (NYSE:BAC)'s global M&A head Patrick Ramsey, adding the downward trend was expected to continue into the second quarter.
""Once we get to the back-end of this, we will see a meaningful snap-back in activity. The degree of that snap-back will depend on the economic outlook and equity market recovery,"" Ramsey said.

""If market turmoil and volatility persist, we will see a polarization between companies in more resilient sectors which can better withstand this crisis, and distressed players in the worst-affected sectors which will be starving for cash,"" said Paulo Pereira, a founding partner at Perella Weinberg Partners.
Pereira added that a rebound in M&A activity will hinge on whether distressed companies will have a ""material destabilizing impact"" on other sectors, including financial services. 
""Inevitably there will be some impact because economic activity is interlinked,"" Pereira said. ""But the financial system is now better capitalized than in 2008 and the actions of governments and central banks will be key in determining the ability of the economy to rebound,"" he said.
Dealmakers expect more political intervention to save companies of strategic national interest.
""There will be rescue deals and there will be many of them,"" de Vecchi said.
""You will see a return of state intervention, triggered not only by protectionist moves to deter unwanted takeovers but by the sheer necessity to rescue entire industries, revive strategic assets and, where possible, create domestic champions through consolidation,"" he said.
The bleak outlook has proved a boon for investment banks to whom clients have turned for advice on how to weather the storm.
""Periods of turmoil underscore the value of a trusted adviser and a global platform that spans not only M&A but also restructuring and sovereign advisory,"" said Peter Orszag, Lazard CEO of financial advisory.
""We remain active advising clients as they navigate the drivers of how long the crisis will last, how they should adjust their balance sheets, and what else they should be doing to respond,"" Orszag said.
Investment banks face tough decisions on whether to approve potentially risky loans in order to stay close to their clients, hoping to win mandates when dealmaking picks up again.

""This is the moment when your clients are coming to you to ask for financing and not just for advice. Supporting your clients in these difficult times is a test of loyalty that can prove vital for a long-term relationship,"" de Vecchi said.

HONG KONG (Reuters) -  Alibaba  Group Holding Ltd (N:BABA) plans to buy at least 10% of Yunda Holding Co Ltd (SZ:002120), marking the e-commerce giant's fifth investment in a large courier, two people with knowledge of the matter told Reuters.
Alibaba is looking to buy the stake from Yunda's controlling shareholders - founding couple Nie Tengyun and Chen Liying - who own 52.19% of Yunda through their wholly owned firm Shanghai LuoJieSi Investment Management, said one of the people. At the current market price, the stake would be worth at least $790 million.
The other person said China's dominant e-commerce firm could go beyond 10% and buy up to 15% of Shenzhen-listed Yunda.
The people declined to be identified as they were not authorized to speak with media.
Under Chinese regulations, a stake of over 5% in a domestically listed company can be sold at a discount of as much as 10% to the firm's share price on the last trading day prior to a deal.
Based on Monday's closing price, the deal could fetch at least $790 million, as Yunda has a market capitalization of about $8.78 billion.
Alibaba has already bought a small stake in Yunda which is below threshold for disclosure, said two other people with knowledge of the matter.
Alibaba declined to comment. Yunda did not respond to a request for comment.
The move would mark another step forward in Alibaba's efforts to gain a bigger say in China's fragmented but fast-growing express delivery industry.
Domestic delivery firms dispatched 63 billion parcels last year, up 24% from 2018, while revenue grew 23% year-on-year to 745 billion yuan ($104.95 billion), data from the State Post Bureau showed in January.
But many firms are under pressure to boost logistics infrastructure and upgrade services to maintain market share as online retail continues to grow and amid continued price competition.
Alibaba's move also comes one year after it took a 14.65% stake in another large express delivery firm, STO Express Co Ltd (SZ:002468), through a 4.66 billion yuan deal.
STO's controlling shareholder later agreed to grant Alibaba an option to purchase another 31.25% stake in three years.
Before STO, Alibaba acquired minority stakes in three other large Chinese couriers - YTO Express Group Co Ltd (SS:600233), Best Inc (N:BEST) and ZTO Express (Cayman) Inc (N:ZTO).
Shanghai-based Yunda, which went public through a backdoor listing in 2016, is one of several couriers that work with Alibaba under Cainiao, the e-commerce firm's logistics division launched in 2013.
Cainiao provides software and shares data with warehouses, carriers and other logistics firms that help deliver packages to shoppers on Tmall and Taobao, Alibaba's largest e-commerce sites.

WASHINGTON/CHICAGO (Reuters) - Airlines must suggest possible compensation in return for government cash assistance and agree to conditions that include not cutting pay or laying off employees through Sept. 30, the U.S. Treasury Department said in guidelines issued on Monday as it prepares to quickly hand out $25 billion.
Congress approved legislation last week authorizing the $25 billion for passenger airlines, as well as $4 billion for cargo carriers and $3 billion in cash for airport contractors like caterers and airplane cleaners.
Under the law, Treasury is supposed to make initial payments of the grants designed to cover payroll costs by next week.
The companies ""must identify financial instruments"" that would ""provide appropriate compensation,"" the guidelines said, adding that these could include warrants, options, preferred stock, debt securities or notes.
The department told applicants to apply by April 3 at 5 p.m. to receive funds as soon as possible. Applications received after April 27 may not be considered.
Other conditions for the cash assistance include limits on executive compensation through March 2022 and no stock buybacks or dividend payments through September 2021.
Airlines may also apply for a separate $29 billion in government loans. Separate Treasury guidelines released Monday for loans said carriers must provide financial instruments ""for the benefit of taxpayers, in equity appreciation or a reasonable interest rate premium."" Companies critical to U.S. national security can seek loans from a separate $17 billion fund.
Those seeking loans must describe losses they have ""incurred or will incur as a result of coronavirus"" and detail the cause of the loss such as reduced demand, unavailability of credit or unbudgeted medical expenses.
The Treasury Department said in reviewing applications for the cash assistance it will consider the ""adequacy of the proposed financial instruments for providing compensation to the Federal Government.""
It also said it ""may refuse to provide payroll support payments to applicants that have taken, or are currently evaluating, any action to commence a bankruptcy.""
Major U.S. airlines on Saturday asked the Treasury department to move quickly to release funds. They have cut tens of thousands of flights as travel demand collapses amid the coronavirus pandemic and warned that without cash they would need to quickly begin massive furloughs.
The chief executives of American Airlines (O:AAL), Delta Air Lines (N:DAL), United Airlines (O:UAL), Southwest Airlines Co (N:LUV) and others wrote in a letter that ""given the urgent and immediate need, it is essential that these funds be disbursed as soon as possible."" 
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Friday taxpayers will be ""compensated"" for providing emergency assistance to air carriers.

American Airlines said Monday it will be allocated about $12 billion of the combined cash assistance and government loans. It has said it expects that Treasury will not seek ""onerous"" conditions.

Investing.com - It’s the battle of the airlines down under for cash as  Virgin Australia  Holdings Ltd (ASX:VAH) requests a government bailout worth billions.
Virgin confirmed on Tuesday morning that it had requested an AUD 1.4 billion ($860.99 million) bailout from the government. An ASX announcement added that this was ""subject to approval by the Virgin Australia Holdings board and the Australian Government"" and ""may or may not include conversion to equity in certain circumstances"".
Qantas Airways Ltd (ASX:QAN) CEO Alan Joyce waded into the fray later in the morning, telling the Scott Morrison government that the airline expects a AUD4.2 billion loan to ""level the playing field"" if it bails out its much smaller rival.
This contrasted with Joyce’s earlier statement that Qantas is not seeking a bailout. But as the COVID-19 pandemic cuts the number of flights, Joyce noted that airlines are facing a ""survival of the fittest"" scenario globally.
Qantas already raised about AUD1 billion loan last week, secured against its fleet.

Samsung Display, a unit of South Korean tech giant Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) Co Ltd, said in October that it suspended one of its two LCD production lines at home amid falling demand for LCD panels and a supply glut.
""We will supply ordered LCDs to our customers by the end of this year without any issues,"" the company said in a statement. 
In October, the Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) supplier said it will invest 13.1 trillion won ($10.72 billion) in facilities and research to upgrade a production line, as it contends with oversupply amid weak global demand for smartphones and TVs.
The investment for the next five years will be focused on converting one of its South Korean LCD lines into a facility to mass produce more advanced ""quantum dot"" screens.
The company runs two LCD production lines at factories in South Korea and two LCD-only factories in China.
Samsung has not yet decided on the future operation of its factories in China, said the spokeswoman.
Samsung Display's cross-town rival LG Display Co Ltd said earlier this year that it will halt domestic production of LCD TV panels by the end of 2020.

The top five gainers in Riyadh this year include a small insurer, a supermarkets owner, a plastic producer, an education company and a hospital operator. They don’t exactly boast a track record of consistent success between them: the first four haven’t broken into the top five in any quarter since 2016, while the last has just made its market debut.
The diverse group of market leaders underscores how hard investors have had to look for bright spots among equities trading in the world’s biggest oil exporter. The local market has been battered by the global stocks slump caused by the coronavirus crisis, and a price war over crude between the kingdom and Russia that has weighed on  Saudi Aramco  (SE:2222), which accounts for 11% of the main index.
“Definitely, these are very unusual circumstances all around us,” said Muhammad Faisal Potrik, the head of research at Riyad Capital. “Consumer staples, utilities, health-care and telecoms will turn out relatively better performance, given that these business are not as affected.”
Saudi Arabia took the rare step of suspending religious pilgrimages and locked down the Islamic holy cities of of Mecca and Medina to curb the disease’s spread. The Tasawul All Share Index has dropped 24% in 2020, headed for its worst quarterly performance since the end of 2008. Just 11 of its 199 members had posted gains this year, as of Monday’s close.
Saudi Aramco is about to wrap up its first full quarter of trading, with a decline of 15%, a weak performance shared with the country’s major petrochemical companies. Saudi Arabia said last week that it had had no contact with Russia about ending their standoff over making production cuts that could boost oil prices and support the local equity market.
But even though Aramco is languishing below its initial public offering price, its shares are still faring better than major global competitors in developed and emerging economies.
 Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C). analyst Alastair Syme said earlier this month that among emerging market oil companies, Aramco is alone in offering payout stability through its guaranteed dividend for minority shareholders, which are in place until 2024.

Investing.com - Asian stock markets made modest gains as China announced higher-than-expected Purchasing Manager’s Index (PMI) data.
China’s Shanghai Composite gained 0.41% by 10:19 PM ET (3:19 AM GMT), while the Shenzhen Component was up 1.26% after data showed the country’s March manufacturing PMI came in at 52.0, compared with the record low of 35.7 last month. Analysts had expected a PMI of 45, according to data compiled by Investing.com.
The country also reported a non-manufacturing PMI of 52.3, much higher last month’s 29.6.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index was up by 2.24%.
Meanwhile, Japan’s Nikkei 225 rose 0.69%, while neighboring South Korea’s KOSPI gained 1.8%.
Down Under, the ASX 200 rose 2.26%.
But analysts cautioned against expectations of a rally, as global stock markets round off their worst quarter since the global financial crisis in 2008. Countries continue to count the economic cost of the COVID-19 pandemic as the number of global cases and deaths showed no sign of abating.
In the U.S., President Donald Trump extended the deadline for COVID-19 quarantine measures to April 30 yesterday.

BENGALURU/SYDNEY (Reuters) - Major global airlines projected layoffs, furloughs and capacity cuts over the next few months, with Air New Zealand on Tuesday warning it expected staffing levels to be 30% lower than it is now, due to the coronavirus pandemic.
Airlines have been rushing to shore up liquidity, reduce capital expenditure and cut costs to stay afloat amid the worst crisis to hit the global aviation industry.
Data firm OAG said the aviation industry was less than half the size it was in mid-January due to the rapid capacity cuts implemented by airlines around the world. Around 40% of the world's passenger jet fleet is now in storage, according to data from aviation firm Cirium.
Air New Zealand (NZ:AIR) said it will lay off about 3,500 employees, nearly a third of its workforce, in the coming months, as the outbreak forced it to cancel nearly all flights.
The virus ""has seen us go from having revenue of $5.8 billion to what is shaping up to be less than $500 million annually,"" Chief Executive Officer Greg Foran told staff in an email. ""We expect that even in a year's time we will be at least 30% smaller than we are today.""
New Zealand's national carrier, which employs 12,500 people, warned the layoffs estimate was a ""conservative"" assumption and the numbers could rise if the domestic lockdown and border restrictions were extended. 
 Air Canada  (TO:AC) will cut second-quarter capacity by 85%-90%, place about 15,200 unionized employees off duty and furlough about 1,300 managers, beginning on or about April 3.
Canada's largest airline said it is drawing down about C$1 billion ($706 million) in credit to bolster liquidity, while senior executives will forgo between 25%-50% of their salary and board members agreed to a 25% cut.
Low-cost U.S. carrier  Spirit Airlines  Inc (N:SAVE) is cancelling all flights to and from the New York region after U.S. officials warned against travel to the area because of the pandemic.
On Monday, Germany's Lufthansa (DE:LHAG) said 27,000 of its staff would reduce hours, Britain's EasyJet PLC (L:EZJ) said it would lay off 4,000 UK-based cabin crew for two months, and low-cost carrier flydubai said it would reduce staff pay for three months.
U.S. airlines have been pushing the Treasury to release up to $58 billion in government grants and loans and had threatened to quickly start laying off tens of thousands of workers within days if they did not get a bailout. 
The $2.2 trillion stimulus and assistance legislation signed into law last week by President Donald Trump gives passenger airlines $25 billion in cash assistance to cover payroll costs and $25 billion in loans, while cargo carriers are eligible for $4 billion in grants and $4 billion in loans.
Treasury faces an April 1 deadline to issue procedures to airlines to apply for grants. 
American Airlines Holdings Inc (O:AAL) intends to apply for up to $12 billion government aid, ensuring no involuntary layoffs or pay cuts in the next six months, executives said in a memo to employees.
""We certainly hope and expect that by that time, the virus will be contained, Americans will be flying again and we will be back to flying a full schedule,"" Chief Executive Doug Parker and President Robert Isom said in the memo.
In Australia,  Virgin Australia  Holdings Ltd (AX:VAH) is seeking a government loan of A$1.4 billion ($863 million) to help it weather the coronavirus crisis, a person with knowledge of the matter said on Tuesday.
The loan package would allow the government to take an ownership stake in Australia's second-largest airline if it was unable to repay the loan in two to three years and is part of a broader request for A$5 billion of airline industry aid, said the source, who was not authorized to speak with media.
Virgin said it was in talks with the government about industry aid if the crisis was prolonged but did not provide details of its request.

(Reuters) - U.S. home rental firm Airbnb said on Monday it was allocating $250 million to help offset losses by hosts around the world whose guests have canceled bookings in the face of the coronavirus pandemic.
The aid, which will pay hosts 25% of their normal cancellation fees, is being offered globally except for China, the company said in a letter sent to hosts by Chief Executive Brian Chesky.
The payments apply to the cancellation of reservations with check-in dates between March 14 and May 31. Because hosts can choose different cancellation policies - some requiring a penalty payment, with others allowing free cancellation up to a certain date before check-in - not all canceled reservations will qualify.
Airbnb had earlier announced that guests would receive a full refund for the cancellation of reservations made on or before March 14 for check-in between March 14 and April 14, which angered many hosts. Airbnb also said that hosts could cancel reservations without a charge. 
Airbnb said it is funding the program for hosts itself and will begin to issue the payments in April. 
Airbnb's revenue in 2019 exceeded $4.8 billion, up 35% on the year, and it has $3 billion in cash, a source told Reuters last week.
The company said in September that it planned to list its shares in 2020, and so far has not changed that position. 
Airbnb also said it is creating a $10 million relief fund for its Superhosts - so-named for meeting certain requirements including good ratings - who rent out their own home and need help paying their rent or mortgage, and some Experience hosts who charge for sharing an experience like food tours.
Hosts can apply for grants for up to $5,000. That fund started with Airbnb employee donations of $1 million and the company's three founders are personally contributing the rest, it said. 
Airbnb also said it worked to secure support for hosts in the recent U.S. stimulus bill that will allow some hosts to benefit from small-business grants, loans and unemployment assistance.
In a video message to hosts on Monday, Chesky said he was confident Airbnb would come back strong after the coronavirus pandemic was over. He added that about half of the stays booked on Airbnb were for periods longer than a month.

CHICAGO (Reuters) - American Airlines Holdings Inc (O:AAL) intends to apply for up to $12 billion in government aid, ensuring no involuntary layoffs or pay cuts in the next six months, executives said in a memo to employees on Monday.
American is eligible for about $6 billion in payroll grants and $6 billion in loans under a stimulus package meant to help airlines and other businesses weather a downturn from the coronavirus. 
Between the government funds and its own cash position, American will be able to fly ""through even the worst of potential future scenarios,"" Chief Executive Doug Parker and President Robert Isom said in the memo.
American, with the largest number of employees of any U.S. carrier, also plans to improve the terms of voluntary unpaid leave and early retirement options for flight attendants and other employees, it said.
American had 133,700 full-time employees in 2019, about 85% of whom were represented by unions. Wages and benefits are its largest operating expense, representing 34% of the total.
With airlines slashing their flying schedules as the coronavirus has crushed air travel demand, their need for pilots, flight attendants, mechanics and gate agents has fallen.
Delta Air Lines (N:DAL) said on Sunday that more than 21,000 of its employees had volunteered so far to take short-term, unpaid leaves of absence while it operates a reduced schedule.
Once demand returns, airlines say they will need trained staff ready to return to work. 
Under the terms of the payroll grants, airlines cannot lay off any employees before Sept. 30. 
""We certainly hope and expect that by that time, the virus will be contained, Americans will be flying again and we will be back to flying a full schedule,"" American's executives said.

192,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 30, 2020 07:10PM ET</span>","J&J, Moderna sign deals with U.S. to produce huge quantity of possible coronavirus vaccines","By Julie Steenhuysen
(Reuters) - The U.S. government has cut deals with Johnson & Johnson (N:JNJ) and  Moderna  Inc (O:MRNA) and said it is in talks with at least two other companies to prepare them to produce massive quantities of coronavirus vaccines even before safe and effective ones become available.
There are currently no approved treatments or vaccines specifically for COVID-19, the respiratory disease that has killed more than 35,000 people and infected over 745,000 globally in just a few months.
No vaccine is expected to be ready for use until at least 2021, as they must still be widely tested in humans before being administered to hundreds of millions, if not billions, of people to prevent infection.
On Monday, J&J announced a $1 billion deal with the U.S. government to create enough manufacturing capacity to make more than 1 billion doses of a vaccine, and its shares closed up 8% at $133.01.
It has chosen a candidate but will not begin testing it in people until September.
Moderna, which this month began very early tests of its vaccine candidate in people, also signed a deal with the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.
The arrangements are part of the federal government's effort to encourage drugmakers to be able to produce massive amounts of COVID-19 vaccines even before any are proven to work.
The J&J effort will be funded in part by about $420 million from BARDA. The agency told Reuters it also plans to spend an unnamed amount to ramp up manufacturing for Moderna's COVID-19 vaccine candidate. 
Moderna shares rose 1.4% to $30.48. 
BARDA ultimately plans to support five or six experimental vaccine candidates, with the hopes of having two or three successful ones, BARDA director Rick Bright said in a phone interview.
Experts have estimated it could be 12 to 18 months before a safe and effective vaccine wins regulatory approval.
""Government and industry is working in unprecedented ways,"" Bright said. The hope is to work ""as quickly as possible and manufacture enough of it for us and the rest of the world in a very short timeframe.""
The agency plans to take over manufacturing of Moderna's vaccine candidate to enable the Cambridge, Massachusetts-based biotech to focus on testing it in larger trials.
BARDA hopes to speed up the back end of the vaccine manufacturing process, which involves ensuring that they are made and packaged according to standards set by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
'A LOT OF RISK INVOLVED'
There are dozens of coronavirus vaccines in development, according to the World Health Organization. But it is still not clear that people develop lasting immunity to this virus, or what it will take for a vaccine to be protective. 
""What you need to do is take an assessment of what the most likely candidates are and invest at risk in those,"" said Seth Berkley, chief executive of the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI).
The earlier you make that decision, the more likely you are to have manufacturing in place, but the less confident you are about whether the vaccine will work, Berkley said.
Typically, decisions on whether to move forward with a vaccine are made after safety trials and preliminary efficacy trials have been completed.
J&J said it will begin human testing in September, with an eye toward having a vaccine ready under an emergency use authorization in early 2021.
J&J Chief Scientific Officer Dr. Paul Stoffels told Reuters the company had to start ramping up manufacturing capacity now, even before it has a signal that its experimental vaccine candidate works. 
""That is the only option for us to get it on time,"" Stoffels said of the early 2021 target. J&J hopes to have data proving its vaccine works by the end of this year.
J&J has a manufacturing plant in the Netherlands that can make up to 300 million doses of vaccine, Stoffels said, but that ""absolutely will not be sufficient for the world.""
The company is also scouting for manufacturing plants in other parts of Europe and Asia capable of making the type of vaccine the company is working on.
Stoffels said J&J's vaccine will be based on the same technology used to make its Ebola vaccine, which has been widely used in people. The company believes it will prove safe.
In lab studies, it has produced strong neutralizing antibodies to the virus - the type needed to make a successful vaccine. 
In addition to the investments in J&J and Moderna, Bright said his agency is in talks with at least two other large vaccine makers, but declined to make them public. 
BARDA is interested in working with a broad range of vaccine technologies and with companies that have proven track records, Bright said.

""There's a lot of risk involved in making a new vaccine, a lot of risk in going quickly,"" Bright said. ""Wherever possible, we need to understand and mitigate that risk.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Low-cost U.S. carrier Spirit Airlines Inc said on Monday it will cancel all flights to and from New York, Connecticut and New Jersey after U.S. officials warned against travel to the area because of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Spirit, which appeared to be the first major U.S. carrier to cancel all flights to the so-called tri-state region, said it was responding to this weekend's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advisory warning against all non-essential travel to and from the area.
Spirit said it will suspend service to the airports it serves in the region - New York LaGuardia, Newark, Hartford, Niagara Falls and Plattsburgh - through at least May 4.
Flights are to be fully suspended by mid-week, the airline said. The Federal Aviation Administration this month waived rules mandating minimum flights from high-traffic airports like LaGuardia because of the coronavirus pandemic.
For the 12 months ending in January, Spirit was the fifth largest carrier at LaGuardia, carrying 1.36 million passengers. It was also the fifth largest carrier at Newark, carrying 1.4 million passengers in the same period.
Spirit said on Monday it had obtained a senior secured revolving credit facility worth $110 million with an option to increase to $350 million with the consent of any increasing lenders. Spirit pledged take-off and landing rights at LaGuardia, aircraft and other assets. 

Spirit said earlier on Monday that its board approved an anti-takeover measure that will ""protect against parties seeking to take advantage of the current market environment to the detriment of Spirit and its shareholders.""

The online lending pioneer also said it had increased interest rates from 2% to 4% for new borrowers, depending on the loan grade.
Jack Dorsey-led  Square Inc  (NYSE:SQ) said last week it had tightened eligibility for loans and expected slow origination growth in the second half of March. 
The actions by lenders comes as Washington last week reached a deal for a $2.2 trillion stimulus package to help businesses and millions of Americans hit by the economic fallout of the coronavirus pandemic.
""Like other fintech and financial services companies, we are assessing the impact to our platform and the market, including the potential impact of aid on affected borrowers, but it is difficult to estimate with any precision,"" LendingClub said.
Adding to uncertainty for borrowers, the number of Americans filing claims for unemployment benefits surged to a record of more than 3 million in the week ending March 21 as strict measures to contain the coronavirus pandemic brought the country to a sudden halt.

San Francisco-based LendingClub said it was waiving fee for late payments starting April 1 through May 31 to help its borrowers and has designed a hardship plan that allows eligible borrowers to easily skip up to two monthly payments.

(Reuters) - Yum Brands Inc (N:YUM), owner of Pizza Hut, KFC and Taco Bell restaurant chains, sold $600 million in bonds on Monday, reopening the U.S. market for junk-rated debt issues after its longest lull since the 2008 financial crisis. 
Yum's bond offering represented a glimmer of investor demand in one the riskiest corners of the corporate credit market, which seized up for much of March after the coronavirus outbreak morphed into an economically devastating pandemic. 
While U.S. companies last week issued new investment-grade debt at a record clip, there had been no new issuance in the so-called high-yield market for junk-rated debt issuers since March 4.
Yum boosted its debt offering by 20%, after planning to raise $500 million. However, Yum was forced to accept a considerably higher borrowing cost than in its prior debt deals. 
The company sold bonds maturing in 2025 at a 7.75% yield. By comparison, Yum raised $800 million in September through 10-year debt with a yield of 4.75%. The higher the yield, the more expensive the bond is for the company.
The debt proceeds will go towards ""general corporate purposes,"" Yum said in a statement. 
The Federal Reserve said last week it will backstop the investment-grade market but has made no such pledge for high-yield debt.
Yum, which has over 48,000 Pizza Hut, Taco Bell and KFC restaurants across the globe, said last week it expects the coronavirus pandemic to impact its second-quarter same-store sales more significantly than in the first quarter, as the fast-spreading virus hits customer traffic at its stores globally.
Yum was among several restaurant companies that this month the White House for aid to help weather the coronavirus crisis.
Earlier on Monday, Moody's amended Yum's ratings outlook to ""negative"" from ""stable."" 
""The negative outlook reflects the risk that there may be a sustained weakening in Yum's credit metrics as they are increasing debt levels at a time when the company is facing significant uncertainty surrounding the potential length and severity of restaurant closures and the ultimate impact that these closures will have on Yum's revenues, earnings and liquidity,"" Moody's Senior Credit Officer Bill Fahy said in a statement. 

Yum shares, which are down 29.8% in 2020, closed up 3.1% at $70.67, giving it a market value of $21 billion.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Prophet Capital Asset Management LP, an investor in loans and structured credit securities hit by recent market turmoil, plans to temporarily block withdrawals from one of its hedge funds and ultimately dissolve it, according to a letter sent to investors on Monday seen by Reuters.
""As you are no doubt aware, financial markets are experiencing extreme volatility and impaired liquidity as a result of the Coronavirus crisis,"" Prophet executive David Rosenblum wrote.
Because of the crisis, the firm had decided ""in turn"" to block all investor redemptions for Prophet Opportunity Partners LP and wind down the fund over time, he added.
The fund, which primarily held hard-hit securities such as commercial mortgages and high-yield collateralized loan obligations, had a net asset value of $539 million as of Feb. 28, with $125 million in cash on hand and total debt of $117 million, according to the letter.
The fund was down 2.6% for 2020 through February, the letter showed. No March performance was given. Before the announcement suspending redemptions, it owed $120 million back to investors on Tuesday, March 31.
Prophet executives did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment. Prophet, based in Austin, Texas, manages approximately $2.4 billion overall, according to the letter.

197,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 30, 2020 06:06PM ET</span>","Ford, GE to produce 50,000 ventilators in 100 days","By Nick Carey
DETROIT (Reuters) - Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co said on Monday it will produce 50,000 ventilators over the next 100 days at a plant in Michigan in cooperation with  General Electric  (NYSE:GE)'s healthcare unit, and can then build 30,000 per month as needed to treat patients afflicted with the coronavirus.
Ford said the simplified ventilator design, which is licensed by GE Healthcare from Florida-based Airon Corp and has been cleared by the Food and Drug Administration, can meet the needs of most COVID-19 patients and relies on air pressure without the need for electricity. 
Officials in states hard hit by the pandemic have pleaded with the Trump administration and manufacturers to speed up production of ventilators to cope with a surge in patients struggling to breathe. Hospitals in New York already are using one ventilator to sustain two patients. New Orleans has a fraction of the ventilators it needs for a surge of COVID-19 patients, Louisiana officials said.
On Friday, President Donald Trump said he would invoke powers under the Defense Production Act to direct manufacturers, including Ford and General Motors Co (NYSE:GM), to produce ventilators. 
On Monday, the head of the United Auto Workers and other officials compared the auto industry's effort to build ventilators to Detroit's conversion to bomber production during the World War Two.
Ford said it plans to begin production of ventilators at a plant in Ypsilanti, Michigan, deploying 500 United Auto Workers employees. 
It said it plans to start production at the facility the week of April 20. That is roughly when New York officials expect the peak of COVID-19 cases to hit their state. 
Ventilators built by Ford, GM and others could be used in other parts of the United States where the peak case loads are expected later.
GM said Sunday it plans to produce up to 10,000 ventilators a month by this summer at a plant in Kokomo, Indiana. 
The Ypsilanti workers will be stationed at a safe distance apart and will be screened for symptoms of coronavirus infection before they enter the plant, Ford officials said. 
""We're using and deploying a whole host of technologies to keep workers safe,"" said Adrian Price, director of global manufacturing core engineering for Ford. The safety procedures will be adapted from work Ford and the UAW have been doing to prepare for the automaker to reopen other U.S. factories, Price said.
Separately, GE and Ford engineers are working together to boost production at a GE plant in Madison, Wisconsin, of a GE ventilator, different from the model licensed from Airon. 
GE expects to double ventilator output from the Wisconsin plant during the second quarter, Tom Westrick, GE Healthcare's vice president for quality, said during a call with reporters on Monday.

In three business days, Switzerland's second-biggest bank has paid out 1.24 billion Swiss francs ($1.29 billion) in loans to around 7,800 companies since the government last week unveiled a 20 billion franc program of state-backed loans at no or low interest to companies hit hard by the epidemic.
""It is a bit early to talk about 2020 bonuses but we are certainly thinking in the direction that we want to show solidarity,"" Gottstein told Swiss broadcaster SRF's Eco program when asked about willingness to make sacrifices.
The disease has killed around 300 people and sickened more than 15,000 in Switzerland.
The Swiss financial watchdog and government have urged banks to curb dividend payments as a way to accumulate capital they could use to support the economy, but Credit Suisse is sticking to plans to pay out its 2019 dividend.
Gottstein said the bank's board would decide in autumn what dividend to propose for 2020, but noted it had stopped a share buyback that accounted for two-thirds of payouts to shareholders.
Rival UBS Group (S:UBSG) stuck to plans to pay a 2019 dividend that is more than half its annual profit.

200,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 30, 2020 05:25PM ET</span>",U.S. markets watchdog Clayton says SEC should not ban short-selling of shares,"By Katanga Johnson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The head of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said on Monday that it should not ban short-selling of shares, amid speculation on further measures the agency might take to arrest a market rout that stems from fears the coronavirus will spark a global recession.
The statement, by SEC Chairman Jay Clayton, comes after other countries, including Spain, Italy and South Korea, have moved to curtail short-sellers, who borrow shares and then sell them, betting their price will fall before the short-sellers buy back the shares and return them, pocketing the difference.
""You need to be able to be on the short side of the market in order to facilitate ordinary market trading,"" Clayton said in an interview on CNBC on Monday, adding that he understands the concerns by some investors but does not favor a ban.
In 1938, the SEC adopted a so-called uptick rule to prevent short-sellers from putting more pressure on a security that was quickly declining but pulled it back in 2007 as electronic trading began to take over Wall Street.
Later, in 2010, the SEC adopted an alternative uptick rule that imposed restrictions on short-selling only when a stock has triggered a circuit breaker by declining in price by at least 10 percent in one day. Under the alternative rule, once the price of the security is above the current national best bid, the practice, which critics say can exacerbate market moves amid panic selling, is permitted.
On Monday, Clayton added that the agency is monitoring concerns of trading whipsaw during extreme volatility.
""We need market integrity, but we believe we're taking care of it with the alternative uptick rule,"" added Clayton.
Some analysts say short-selling bans undermine free markets, as well as limit accurate asset pricing and dampen trading volumes, which in turn raises transaction costs for all investors. Even more, others point out that bourses already have safeguards like circuit breakers to slow markets during bouts of extreme volatility.
The effectiveness of short-selling bans has also been questioned by some academics and institutions, including the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.

""The current U.S. short-selling framework has held up amid heavy volumes and is serving its purpose. Adding restrictions will only make the current problem worse,"" said Michael Pedroni, an international policy expert at the Washington-based hedge fund lobbying group Managed Funds Association.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks rose on Monday, led in part by healthcare stocks as investors looked for shares that have become cheap and can withstand the impact to the economy from efforts to stem the spread of the coronavirus. 
The S&P healthcare sector (SPXHC) jumped 4.67%, in part due to gains in Johnson & Johnson (N:JNJ) and Abbot Laboratories. JNJ surged 8.00% on the U.S. government's plans to help fund the creation of enough manufacturing capacity for its coronavirus vaccine, currently under development.
 Abbott Laboratories  (N:ABT) climbed 6.41% after winning U.S. approval for a diagnostic test for COVID-19. 
Along with healthcare, the technology sector (SPLRCT) also rose more than 4% on the day, as Microsoft (O:MSFT) shares jumped more than 7%, the biggest boost to the broad S&P 500. A record $2.2 trillion in aid and policy easing from the Federal Reserve helped equities recover some of their losses last week, with the S&P 500 (SPX) posting its biggest weekly percentage gain in over a decade and the Dow Jones (DJI) its best since 1938, even after each dropped more than 3% to end the trading week on Friday.
Each of Wall Street's three major indexes remain down more than 20% from the February highs, but investors are now trying to assess the economic damage and identify which companies will be on solid footing when the economy begins to accelerate.
""You are looking for a way to re-enter the market on stocks that are going to give you an opportunity to participate,"" said Phil Blancato, CEO of Ladenburg Thalmann Asset Management in New York. 
""You look at some of those and say there is an opportunity for me to buy good companies with strong balance sheets that on the other side of this should produce."" 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) rose 690.7 points, or 3.19%, to 22,327.48, the S&P 500 (SPX) gained 85.18 points, or 3.35%, to 2,626.65 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) added 271.77 points, or 3.62%, to 7,774.15.
President Donald Trump followed last week's massive fiscal stimulus package by extending his stay-at-home guidelines, leaving investors to await more signs on the next stages of a deepening economic crisis.
That is convincing few that the worst of the most dramatic sell-off in a decade is over, and Wall Street's fear gauge (VIX), which predicts future volatility, is still running as high as it has been since the 2008 financial crisis. 
However, the prospect of more government stimulus has given investors something to hold on to as they wait for signs of economic relief. Upcoming data is likely to confirm damage to the economy, but how much has been priced in by the market remained to be seen. 
JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) said on Saturday it expected real U.S. gross domestic product to fall 10% in the first quarter and plunge 25% in the second quarter. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.56-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.67-to-1 ratio favored advancers.
The S&P 500 posted one new 52-week high and two new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded six new highs and 30 new lows. 

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 12.19 billion shares, compared to the 15.81 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

DETROIT (Reuters) - General Motors Co (N:GM) told suppliers on Monday that it is postponing work on at least half a dozen future models to conserve cash during the coronavirus pandemic and could delay the planned launch in late April of its highly profitable large sport utility vehicles.
GM previously told suppliers that it planned to begin production in late April of the redesigned 2021 Cadillac Escalade, GMC Yukon, Chevrolet Tahoe and Suburban full-size SUVs at its Arlington, Texas, plant after winding up production of the outgoing models this week, according to an email reviewed by Reuters.
But a GM spokesman on Monday said the plan to reopen Arlington was ""fluid,"" and that the automaker would not restart production at the plant until it was safe to do so.
The big SUVs are among GM's most profitable vehicles.
In an email to suppliers viewed by Reuters and confirmed as authentic by GM, the automaker also said it was suspending development work on six future vehicle programs, including updates of the Chevrolet Equinox, GMC Terrain, Cadillac XT4, Bolt EV, Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra.
GM said preproduction work on those programs would be pushed back to calendar year 2021, with most of the updated vehicles scheduled to be launched as 2022 models.
GM last week told employees and suppliers it was delaying work on some future vehicles while pushing ahead with near-term models such as its redesigned full-size SUVs and the GMC Hummer EV, Cadillac Lyriq, Chevrolet Bolt EUV and Cruise Origin, as well as its new Ultium battery system.
GM said previously that it was closing most of its U.S. plants indefinitely.
In its Monday email, GM asked suppliers to stop work on all pre-production tooling and pre-production parts manufacturing, but also not to dispose of any tooling or materials.
In separate emails to suppliers, GM said it planned to run out production this week of the outgoing Escalade, Yukon, Tahoe and Suburban SUVs in preparation for the launch of the redesigned 2021 models.
GM told Reuters it had solicited volunteers from its workforce to finish the build-out of the current SUVs on a single shift in Arlington. In addition, GM is installing more safeguards in the plant to help protect workers, including thermal temperature scanning and additional personal protective equipment.

The work is expected to be completed in a week.

The national carrier, which employs 12,500 people, said the announced number of layoffs was a ""conservative"" assumption, and that it could rise if the domestic lockdown and border restrictions were extended.
Large scale layoffs of its global staff will start this week, the company said. 
""Unfortunately, COVID-19 has seen us go from having revenue of NZ$5.8 billion to what is shaping up to be less than NZ$500 million annually based on the current booking patterns we are seeing,"" Chief Executive Officer Greg Foran said in an email to staff and customers.
""This has the potential to be catastrophic for our business unless we take some decisive action.""
Air New Zealand is an example of the dire situation facing airlines across the world due to curbs on travel to control the spread of the virus. 
""We have had to cut more than 95 percent of our flights here in New Zealand and around the world. The only flights remaining are in place to keep supply lines open and transport options for essential services personnel,"" Foran added.
Earlier in March, the New Zealand government offered the airline a NZ$900 million ($540.99 million) lifeline to keep it in the air.
The company also noted that ""every dollar we use from this loan facility comes with interest (more than double current interest rates for a household mortgage) and must be re-paid.""

CHICAGO (Reuters) - U.S. senators are calling for investigations of record profit margins for beef processors like  Tyson Foods  (N:TSN) and Cargill, after ranchers complained surging meat prices due to coronavirus hoarding did not translate into higher cattle prices. 
Futures prices for cattle have tumbled during the outbreak, worrying farmers as the U.S. economy heads into a downturn and fueling questions about whether the market run by CME Group (O:CME) is an effective tool for risk management.
Senator Charles Grassley of Iowa wrote on Twitter that U.S. Department of Agriculture, Department of Justice and Commodity Futures Trading Commission probes may be needed to determine why ranchers did not benefit from soaring meat demand.
""Beef is flying off grocery shelves but farmers are seeing prices go down,"" Grassley said. ""If packers are illegally manipulating markets during crisis, we need USDA & DOJ & CFTC to investigate + help farmers. Four companies control 80% of market & they're taking advantage."" 
Processors' margins leapt to more than $600 per head of cattle last week, HedgersEdge.com said. But cattle producers are operating at a net loss, four U.S. senators from South Dakota, North Dakota and Montana told the Justice Department in a letter that called for a price-fixing investigation.
Cargill said it is a committed buyer in the cash market for cattle, which was less impacted than futures. Tyson said it wants cattle producers to succeed and paid them a premium last week.
""This is an uncertain and unprecedented time, where food service beef demand has come to an immediate and virtual standstill, while retail demand has increased,"" Tyson said.
USDA said it was working with CFTC to ensure transparency and integrity in agricultural markets.
Live cattle futures  dropped 3.5% on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange over the last three weeks amid worries the virus would shut slaughterhouses, while prices for beef that meat companies ship to wholesale buyers jumped about 20%.
Futures sank as managed funds liquidated long positions, or bets prices will rise, said Cassie Fish, a beef expert who formerly worked for Tyson. It was the market's biggest event-driven decline in more than 45 years, she said.
""They decided to get out,"" Fish said. ""It was like a stampede."" 
Farmers and processors use futures to offset the risk of producing meat, and futures are intended to reflect the underlying cash market. April cattle futures  ended last week at a record $18 to $19 under the cash market, according to consultancy AgResource.

CME Group said it is committed to improving its livestock markets.

207,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 30, 2020 04:18PM ET</span>",Shuttle Service Via Hits $2.25 Billion Value With New Funding,"(Bloomberg) -- Via Transportation Inc., which operates shared ride-hailing services in several cities and provides software to dozens of transit agencies, has raised a major funding round and more than doubled its valuation even as the pandemic hammers the global transportation industry.
The funding round, which has been in the works for months, is being led by Exor NV, an Italian holding company that also holds stakes in Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV and  Ferrari NV  (NYSE:RACE). Exor invested $200 million, Via said on Monday.
That’s about half of the full $400 million funding round, said one person, who asked not to be identified discussing private matters. The new cash infusion values Via at $2.25 billion, significantly more than its last private market valuation in 2017. The Wall Street Journal earlier reported some details of the deal.
Exor’s share price has been slammed by the coronavirus pandemic, which has hit the Italian economy particularly hard. The company’s stock is down nearly 40% since its February highs, and earlier this month was trading at its lowest level since 2016.
While Via’s business bears some resemblance to ride-hailing companies like Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc. and  Lyft  Inc (NASDAQ:LYFT)., there are significant differences. When it was founded in 2012, the idea was to build technology that it could sell to public transit agencies to help them implement services like routes that change based on demand. Local governments weren’t interested, said Daniel Ramot, Via’s co-founder and chief executive officer. So the company began running its own commercial shuttle service in New York, mostly using vans serving as mini-buses.
Transit agencies have begun coming around in recent years, and Via now counts about 120 as clients, 80% of whom use Via’s software but not its vehicles. The company expected software licensing revenue to surpass revenue from its shuttle buses as soon as this year, said Ramot in a phone interview from Colorado, where he has been living for several weeks since decamping from Manhattan’s Upper West Side with his family. “Covid throws a lot of this into disarray,” he added.
Like all ride-hailing companies, Via has seen a sharp drop in demand since the outbreak. About 10 days ago it suspended all shared rides, using its vehicles instead as single-passenger ride-hailing vans. The private rides are significantly more expensive for customers than Via’s shared rides, said Ramot, and are essentially a stop-gap measure.
In some cases, Via is adapting its service to respond to specialized transportation needs. Via suspended its service in Berlin on March 25, for instance, and has temporarily replaced it with free evening service for medical and nursing staff in the city. In Malta, its service is now dedicated to food delivery. And as other cities attempt to set up shuttle services for essential workers, some are using Via’s software to plan for significant alterations to their networks, Ramot said.
The Covid-19 pandemic may accelerate Via’s transition from a transportation operator to a software company, according to Ramot. “If we’re able to quickly adapt to the new reality—and this doesn’t last too long—we’re very positive,” he said. But Ramot admitted he has no idea how things will actually play out. “It’s hard to offer mobility when everybody’s sheltering in place,” he said.

Investing.com – The Dow made a bright start to the week on Monday, with investors weighing the impact of President Trump's move to extend measures to combat the Covid-19 pandemic.
The Dow 3.19%, or 690 points. The S&P 500 added 3.29% and the Nasdaq Composite rose 3.62%.
Over the weekend, President Trump said the U.S. containment measures, which include social distancing, would be extended to April 30 from mid-April.
The move comes just days after Trump previously touted Easter as a ""beautiful timeline,"" to reopen the U.S. While the move is widely expected to help stem the spread of the coronavirus, some appear worried about the prospect of a deeper recession.  
""Amid the prospects of keeping workers home and businesses closed for another 30 days, the market is beginning to price in a more severe recession despite unprecedented stimulus,"" Stifel said in a note.
Infections in the U.S. jumped 72% to about 148,000 since Friday, according to Johns Hopkins Case Tracker.
While cases worldwide continue to mount, Italy, the epicenter of the outbreak in Europe, offered a glimmer of hope. Italy reported 4,050 infections, compared with 5,217 on Sunday, the lowest daily number of infections in two weeks.
Just days after Trump signed the $2 trillion stimulus deal, the largest aid package in U.S. history, to ensure the economy bounces back quickly from a widely expected recession, investors are seemingly betting on further stimulus from Congress.
House Majority Leader Nancy Pelosi said the fourth coronavirus bill would be about recovery, with aid aimed at supporting infrastructure and opportunities for family and medical leave.
Healthcare and tech stocks spearheaded the broader market rally, with chip and FANG stocks among the biggest gainers.

The bank plans to raise $5 billion to $10 billion in the next couple of months from clients including pension funds, sovereign-wealth funds, family offices and private banks, according to the source. 
The biggest U.S. bank by assets already has about $10 billion of client capital that it plans to use on opportunities created by the market disruption in the wake of the outbreak.
That amount has roughly $3 billion earmarked for credit, $3 billion for real estate and $4 billion across transportation and infrastructure.
The pandemic has sent global financial markets into a tailspin, knocking $7 trillion off the value of S&P 500 companies and raising fears of a deep global recession.
JPMorgan said on Saturday it expected real U.S. gross domestic product to fall 10% in the first quarter and plunge 25% in the second quarter. 

Bloomberg first reported the possible capital raise on Monday.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The global economy, which has been battered by the coronavirus outbreak, will recover steadily, in part due to the absence of obstacles usually found in a recovery from a typical financial crises, Larry Fink, chief executive at BlackRock Inc (N:BLK), said in his annual letter to shareholders on Monday.
""Central banks are moving quickly to address problems in credit markets, and governments are now acting aggressively to enact fiscal stimulus,"" he said.
These actions are likely to be more effective and work more quickly since they are not fighting against the same structural challenges as they were a decade ago, Fink said.
A raft of fiscal and monetary measures across the globe have helped steady investors' nerves in recent days, even as hopes remain that central banks and governments stand ready to provide even more support if needed.
Fink, who is also chairman at BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, said the stressed conditions in markets had highlighted the role of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in providing liquidity and transparency, especially fixed-income ETFs.

""As markets experienced significant stress related to concerns over the global spread of the virus, ETFs traded in record volumes, including $1.4 trillion in the U.S. alone, or 37% of all U.S. equity activity compared to a 27% average for 2019,"" Fink said.

Investing.com - The ongoing measures from government worldwide to contain the Covid-19 pandemic has led Apple to shutter most of its stores, raising fears of a slump in iPhone sales, but the room for growth in its services and wearables continues to fill some on Wall Street with optimism.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) rose 2%.
Apple's services and wearables units have room to grow, UBS said, after its survey of iPhone users across four geographies showed that 31% of iPhone owners are spending less than $1 each month on the App Store, underscoring the potential for spending to rise in the years ahead.
The number of respondents interested in Apple Arcade, Apple's monthly gaming subscription offering, jumped to 39% from 31%. While the percentage of iPhone owners who own Airpods or an Apple Watch remained low at 12% and 17%, respectively, UBS said.
With coronavirus disruptions to the global economy likely to continue to hurt demand and prompt Apple to delay its 5G iPhone launch, set for the Fall this year, UBS cut its expectations for iPhone sales by 16% to 162 million units.
But iPhone demand will return strongly in 2021, with UBS estimating a 30% increase in unit sales to about 210M million units.
Others on Wall Street are also betting on Apple delaying its 5G phone rollout until the holiday season.
""The Key 5G iPhone product launches set for the Fall delays into the holiday season and normalizing US and Europe consumer demand trajectory into Fall timeframe, while demand across China rebounds modestly into the June and September quarters, however with some clear demand destruction,""  Wedbush said."

221,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 30, 2020 02:30PM ET</span>",Coronavirus drives U.S. March auto sales off a cliff,"By Nick Carey
DETROIT (Reuters) - U.S. new vehicle sales likely drove off a cliff in March as the coronavirus pandemic pounded consumer confidence and shuttered dealerships across much of the country, and sales are likely to take a further beating in April as social distancing guidelines remain in place. 
""When you look at March, we basically lost half the month,"" said Eric Lyman, chief industry analyst at car-shopping website TrueCar.com (O:TRUE). 
TrueCar has forecast a sales drop for March of 37 percent and Lyman said sales in April could also be off between 50 percent to 60 percent.
A rebound for the sector will likely depend on how long the crisis lasts and what level of support the U.S. government provides for consumers in the meantime.
Most major automakers, including General Motors Co (N:GM) and Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203), are due to report quarterly U.S. sales on April 1.  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) and  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles NV (MI:FCHA) will report sales on April 2.
Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) also typically reports first quarter deliveries during the week after the quarter ends. Analysts had expected the company to deliver about 93,000 vehicles during the quarter, according to Refinitiv. Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk on March 19 suspended production at the company's Fremont, California, assembly plant under pressure from local authorities.
Just how bad March was is an open question. Cox Automotive did not release a monthly forecast, but said its data showed that on March 27, new vehicle sales to consumers fell 55 percent versus the same day in 2019. 
In U.S. states under ""stay-at-home"" orders, sales fell as much as 80 percent to 90 percent, Cox estimated. Those include states like California and New York, home to a large portion of the American car-buying population.
""April will be just as dismal,"" said Cox analyst Michelle Krebs. 
IHS Markit estimates the coronavirus pandemic will cut full-year 2020 sales by 15.3 percent and globally sales will fall 12 percent - ""considerably worse"" than the fall in sales during the Great Recession in 2008-2009. 
More dealers are embracing online sales, which could help mitigate falling sales.
But U.S. consumer confidence plunged in March to the lowest level since October 2016 as the coronavirus epidemic upended life for Americans. 
George Augustaitis, director of automotive industry analytics at  CarGurus  Inc (O:CARG), an online marketplace for new and used cars, said a rebound in new vehicle sales will depend on government support for workers laid off during the crisis.
""If these consumers are taken care of, we should see the market rebound fairly quickly,"" Augustaitis said.

The $116 billion Vanguard S&P 500 ETF, or VOO, took in $1.7 billion last week -- following its worst outflow since October, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Meanwhile, BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK).’s iShares 1-3 Year Treasury Bond ETF, or SHY, lost almost $1.5 billion in the span after five straight weeks of inflows.
Dramatic swings have been the rule in global markets this month as investors try to price in the coronavirus outbreak that has shut down economies, put millions out of work and made it all but certain corporate earnings will drop. The S&P 500 Index climbed for the fourth time in five days even after a weekend full of negative pandemic news.
“We see volatility just roaring through for a while,” said Gene Goldman, chief investment officer at Cetera Investment Management. “Each day brings new information about how to think about the future, it’s going to be a day-by-day situation.”
Here are some other highlights:
Stocks
Flows into funds tracking the S&P 500 have been on a roller-coaster. The $232 billion SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust, or SPY (NYSE:SPY), saw $7.7 billion in withdrawals in the five days through March 27, following three weeks of massive inflows. Meanwhile, the $160 billion iShares Core S&P 500 ETF, or IVV, took in $499 million after losing $6.6 billion in the previous week.
Bets on technology stocks have been whipsawed amid debate over the ability of industry giants to weather the coronavirus impacts -- with some investors viewing the sector as a safe place. Still, that didn’t stop Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 ETF from losing $974 million last week after gaining almost $4.3 billion in the previous one, its best in 20 years.
State Street’s Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR Fund, ticker XLP, lost $1.1 billion last week. That followed seven straight weeks of inflows.
Bonds
The rush for cash-like debt ETFs slowed down, with the $22.4 billion SHY posting its worst week since June. Meanwhile, SPDR Portfolio Short Term Treasury ETF, or SPTS, saw its worst week on record -- losing $1.1 billion.

Gold
 State Street  Corp (NYSE:STT).’s SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE:GLD) fund, ticker GLD, took in almost $2.9 billion last week, the most since 2009. The $50 billion ETF had seen massive outflows for two straight weeks.
Bullion futures had their best weekly performance since 2008 as governments laid out fiscal stimulus while central banks started pumping in more money into the financial system to cushion the economic fallout from the coronavirus.  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). analysts wrote last week that gold may have reached an inflection point.
“From here on, it will depend on how risk-on, risk-off the market is,” said Fabiana Fedeli, global head of fundamental equities at Robeco. “Gold will always have some short-term periods of volatility if it is required to cover positions in the market.”

The company, which has about 130,000 employees, earlier this month shut its more than 800 stores, suspended quarterly dividend and withdrew its 2020 forecasts. It has also drawn down all its available credit and frozen hiring and spending to offset the impact of the pandemic on sales.
Retailers such as Nordstrom (N:JWN) and Gap Inc (N:GPS) have also moved to cut costs in an attempt to cope with the financial strain and uncertainty caused by the outbreak. 
""We've already taken measures to maintain financial flexibility ... While these actions have helped, it is not enough,"" Macy's said in a statement https://www.macysinc.com/news-media/press-releases/detail/1618/macys-inc-provides-business-update-in-response-to. 
Widespread lockdowns to arrest the spread of the outbreak have hammered sales for the retailer as most of its physical stores remain closed, despite the online business staying up and running.
The fast-spreading virus, which has killed about 34,000 people across the globe, has only compounded sales pressure for retailers that were already struggling with stiff competition and a shift to online shopping. 
Further underscoring the pandemic's devastating blow to the U.S. economy, the number of Americans filing claims for unemployment benefits surged to a record of more than 3 million in the week before last.
The economic hit has also prompted the Federal Reserve to take the extraordinary measure of a $2 trillion stimulus package.
Macy's said on Monday it would maintain the ""absolute minimum"" workforce needed to maintain basic operations across its Macy's, Bloomingdales and Bluemercury brands.
At least through May, furloughed employees enrolled in health benefits will continue to receive coverage, with the company covering the premium amount. Employees at a director-level who are not furloughed will receive a pay cut.
The retailer added there would be fewer furloughs in its digital business, which is still operational, supporting distribution centers and call centers.
Macy's said it planned to keep its stores shut and bring back employees on a staggered basis only once business resumes.

229,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 30, 2020 01:10PM ET</span>",Short-term funding crunch pushes European companies into bonds,"By Abhinav Ramnarayan
LONDON (Reuters) - A slew of European corporate bond issues over the past week have brought some cheer to shell-shocked markets, but a key reason for the rush may be more concerning: A scant commercial paper market.
European companies issued more than 20 billion euros ($22.1 billion) of debt combined last week, according to one corporate bond banker, and on Monday morning Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) and AB Inbev launched new issues.
While this issuance may be a positive sign that well-rated companies can get cash, it is not necessarily an indication that all is well for corporate balance sheet financing.
Five bankers and treasurers said one key bottleneck yet to be addressed is in the market for commercial paper - the short-term borrowing used widely by Europe's leading companies to fund day-to-day operations, such as paying salaries.
""Over the last two weeks, there was no way to get any commercial paper issued at all,"" said Volker Heischkamp, head of treasury at German energy firm Innogy SE. 
While he said his company has a relatively strong position in terms of working capital, he said many treasurers are waiting to see what more the European Central Bank will do to boost this crucial market.
""A working money market is something that's very important for any developed economy to operate,"" he said. 
Both the ECB and the U.S. Federal Reserve's newly announced stimulus program include the buying of commercial paper, but the details of the ECB program are not yet clear enough to tempt back other buyers.
The impact of the ECB program has not been felt yet, said another European corporate treasurer who preferred to remain anonymous as he is not authorised to speak to the press.
""The commercial paper market is dead. Unless liquidity returns, we will have to turn to the banks and draw down our credit facilities, and draw all the liquidity from banks,"" he said.
Bluebay Asset Management portfolio manager Kaspar Hense said a looming recession makes it difficult for investors to give short-term loans to companies. ""Investors are reluctant to give a corporates money at 1% at a time when there is short-term risk and curves are flattening everywhere. The market is certainly under stress,"" he said.
BOND FLURRY
On the upside, monetary stimulus has eased the pressure on bond markets, allowing investment grade companies including Nestle, Sanofi (PA:SASY) and Heineken to tap investors. 
But bankers who managed some of those debt sales say that many of the companies are issuing bonds because of the dried-up money markets.
""For corporates, the ability to burn cash has increased and the appetite for risk is much diminished, which has hit the commercial paper market badly,"" said a corporate bond banker who worked on some of last week's deals. 
""That's a concern because it's impacting the highly rated corporates for the first time, as they use commercial paper as a fundamental tool for working capital,"" he added, declining to be named as he is not authorized to speak about his clients. 
Of the five bond issuers from last week contacted by Reuters, Nestle said that they had not experienced ""significant difficulties"" in accessing commercial paper markets and that their bond issue was a long-standing plan.
Others either declined to comment or were not immediately available to speak.
U.S. commercial paper rates, widely used and referenced in the European market as well, are seeing their spread over benchmarks balloon out alarmingly, despite measures taken by the Federal Reserve.
The three-month commercial paper rate in the United States  has seen its spread over three-month Treasury bills (US3MT=RR) go from 10 basis points at the start of March to 160 basis points.

230,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 30, 2020 01:00PM ET</span>",G-20 Trade Chiefs Defend Open Supply Chains Amid Virus Fight,"(Bloomberg) -- Group of 20 trade chiefs pledged to try to keep supply chains open as the world fights to contain the coronavirus pandemic and limit the economic fallout.
The G-20 commerce ministers also vowed to “guard against profiteering and unjustified price increases” during a conference call on Monday devoted to the trade and investment implications of the health scare.
“We will continue to work together to deliver a free, fair, non-discriminatory, transparent, predictable and stable trade and investment environment, and to keep our markets open,” the ministers said in a joint statement released by Saudi Arabia, current holder of the G-20’s rotating presidency. “We will explore ways for logistics networks via air, sea and land freight to remain open.”
The pandemic is exposing rifts between countries’ traditional pledges to uphold free trade and their actions to meet the short-term needs of domestic populations facing lockdowns meant to stop the spread of the virus, which has killed 35,000 globally.
Russia, for example, last week proposed limiting shipments of its grain abroad. The European Union criticized such moves on Monday by warning against food-export restrictions.
“There is no global supply shortage at this time and such measures are completely unjustified,” EU Trade Commissioner Phil Hogan told his G-20 counterparts.
The EU, the world’s most lucrative single market, has itself faced criticism for a mid-March decision temporarily to require an authorization for the sale outside the 27-nation bloc of personal protective equipment needed to fight the virus, known as Covid-19.
In their joint statement, the G-20 trade chiefs appeared to offer scope for such moves by saying they can be compatible with World Trade Organization rules.
“We agree that emergency measures designed to tackle Covid-19, if deemed necessary, must be targeted, proportionate, transparent, and temporary, and that they do not create unnecessary barriers to trade or disruption to global supply chains, and are consistent with WTO rules,” the ministers said.

235,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 30, 2020 12:30PM ET</span>",Airbus struggles to lift crisis-hit jet output,"By Tim Hepher and Johanna Decorse
PARIS/TOULOUSE (Reuters) - Europe's Airbus (PA:AIR) is grappling with labor and supply chain shortages and may only be able to restore aircraft production to some 10-20% of normal levels for now because of partial shutdowns, industry and union sources said.
Worst affected are wide-body jets, demand for which is expected to come under pressure as the coronavirus crisis hits airlines worldwide, especially in the long-haul Asia market.
The European planemaker, whose factories are spread across Europe, restored output at French and Spanish plants a week ago after a four-day shutdown. On Monday it announced a new closure of Spanish plants that make tail sections of Airbus jets.
Airbus said it would suspend most production in Spain until April 9 after the Madrid government tightened the coronavirus lockdown. It has also said British and German wings production and assembly would stop for three weeks.
On Monday, union officials estimated 10-12% of Airbus staff were present at Airbus headquarters factories in Toulouse. An industry official put the total closer to 15%.
""Activity has restarted on the A320 line, and very weakly on the (wide-body) A350 and A330,"" said Francoise Vallin, Airbus coordinator for the CFE-CGC union.
Airbus reiterated it had withdrawn 2020 targets.
STRATEGIC SECTOR
Despite a massive effort by the French government to keep strategic parts of the economy running with credit guarantees and initiatives to protect small businesses, parts shortages persist throughout the supply chain, industry sources said.
Especially badly hit are the so-called tier-two or tier-three suppliers, which are sub-contractors to larger companies that deal directly with Airbus or its U.S. rival Boeing (NYSE:BA).
""Up to half the French supply chain has been closed at some point but the situation is improving,"" a senior executive said. 
Airbus and other major aerospace companies have been left in no doubt that the French government sees it as a strategically important sector and should not risk collapse of the supply chain by closing operations completely, two senior sources said.
The immediate priority is to safeguard defense and security activities linked to public infrastructure, one of them added.
""The idea is not to stop everything totally, because getting the sub-contractors and suppliers going again could be a very long process,"" Vallin said.
By contrast with the auto sector, suppliers are expected to pick up speed only gradually as airlines resume flying and amass the cash needed to fulfill record orders. Airlines last week predicted a slower U-shaped recovery rather than a V-shaped one.
France's  Safran  (PA:SAF), the world's third largest aero supplier, said last week it continued to deliver engines to Airbus and had enough parts for 2-to-3 weeks. But its chief executive noted some problems further down its supply chain.
Airbus is also finding it difficult to make deliveries because of the logistics of getting foreign pilots to France or Germany and the reluctance of many airlines to take aircraft as they face liquidity problems, industry sources said.
Even such details as finding hotels are said to be a problem, forcing Airbus to look at using its own hotel and restaurant in its in-house academy known as Airbus University.

Unions and some analysts have expressed surprise that it has not shut factories completely given the difficulty of making deliveries. The company has said it is taking every possible step to keep its people healthy and is not forcing anybody to work.

The government's statement came in response to a proposal by the World Wide Fund for Nature's Finnish branch to amend Fortum's articles of association at its annual general meeting on Tuesday. 
The WWF hopes to pressure Germany's Uniper (UN01.DE), in which Fortum holds a majority stake, to get rid of coal as an energy source.
Earlier this month, Fortum said a final obstacle had been removed for it to gain control of its German rival, ending a more than two-year takeover battle. [L8N2B65J7] 
The minister in charge of the Finnish government's ownership steering group, Tytti Tuppurainen, rejected WWF Finland's proposal to include the Paris climate deal's goal of maximum 1.5 degree Celsius temperature rise in Fortum's articles of association. 
Such a non-profit move was not possible for a listed company under current legislation, Tuppurainen said. She added, however, that the government wants carbon neutrality to be a joint goal for it and Fortum.
""The (WWF) proposal's ambition is in line with that of the state owner,"" Tuppurainen wrote.
Environmental organizations including the WWF have criticized Uniper for its decision to proceed with the planned startup of a brand new coal plant, Datteln4 in Germany, despite its effort to cut carbon emissions.
""Fortum should announce a timetable for the shutdown of German energy group Uniper's coal power,"" WWF Finland wrote in a statement earlier.
Fortum has been careful not to criticize Uniper publicly for its emission cut goals but has demanded strategic alignment, calling Uniper's new strategy to shift towards greener generation ""a step in the right direction"". 
But the Finnish government, which has set carbon neutrality by 2035 as a goal for Finland, may want Fortum to force Uniper to do more.

""The owner supports Fortum's strategy which is built on the assumption that the company will thrive in a carbon neutral society,"" Tuppurainen said. ""We demand a strong execution of the strategy.""

Cracks are appearing across the emerging-market landscape like never before.
As most nations brace for a likely surge in coronavirus cases, the signals from the developing world could hardly be more worrying for investors. Indexes of stocks, bonds and currencies may have risen last week as countries from India and Brazil to South Africa enacted unprecedented measures to buttress their economies, but Friday’s retreat was a reminder the turmoil is far from over. Trading on Monday started poorly, with emerging equities and currencies under pressure and crude oil sliding to a 17-year low.
“We find it too soon to sound the all-clear,”  Deutsche Bank  AG (DE:DBKGn) strategists led by Drausio Giacomelli in New York wrote in a note to clients. Stimulus efforts “are largely insufficient to deal with a prolonged crisis, and it is crucial that current measures suffice to contain the pandemic globally. This remains unknown,” they said.
Asian policy makers are piling on further measures to counter the impact of the virus. The People’s Bank of China on Monday lowered the interest rate it charges on loans to banks by the most since 2015, while Philippine central bank Governor Benjamin Diokno said over the weekend he’s ready to support the economy with further rate cuts and purchases of government securities.
More regions went on lockdown Monday, including the Thai tourist island of Phuket, while Indonesia and Vietnam prepared possible quarantines of their largest cities.
The rand slumped to a record low in early Monday trading after Moody’s Investors Service cut South Africa’s debt rating to junk on Friday. The nation may approach the International Monetary Fund for the first time for funding to fight the virus, Finance Minister Tito Mboweni said. The Mexican peso led declines after S&P Global Ratings lowered the nation’s rating to BBB, the second-lowest investment grade score.

Emerging-market stocks last week had their biggest rally since 2018 and currencies strengthened on the back of global stimulus measures. But a sense of foreboding lingers. JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co.’s gauge of expected price swings in developing-nation currencies is headed for its biggest monthly jump since the height of the global financial crisis in October 2008. Equities are poised for their worst month since the crisis, too.
“In the large emerging markets of the world economy -- the likes of Brazil, Argentina, sub-Saharan Africa, India, Thailand, and Malaysia -- the virus has yet to arrive at full strength,” Adam Tooze, a Columbia University economic historian and the author of Crashed, an account of the 2008 crisis, wrote in Foreign Policy. “With their populations at risk, their public finances stretched, and financial markets in turmoil, many emerging-market states and developing countries face a huge challenge.”

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Global equity benchmarks rose slightly on Monday despite a drop in oil prices to their lowest levels since 2002, as central banks and the United States tried to contain damage from the rapidly spreading coronavirus that has upended the global economy. 
U.S. President Donald Trump on Sunday extended the government's stay-at-home guidelines until the end of April, dropping a sharply criticized plan to get the economy up and running by mid-April after a top medical adviser said more than 100,000 Americans could die from the outbreak.
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) now predicts that global gross domestic product (GDP) - the total monetary value of all goods and services produced - could contract at a 10.5% annualized rate in the first half of the year. As a result, central banks have mounted an all-out effort to bolster activity with interest rate cuts and massive asset-buying campaigns, which have at least eased liquidity strains in markets.
China on Monday became the latest to add stimulus, with a cut of 20 basis points to a key reverse repo rate, the largest in nearly five years.
MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.18% following slight gains in Europe and broad declines in Asia.
In early trading, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 11.34 points, or 0.05%, to 21,648.12, the S&P 500 gained 18.52 points, or 0.73%, to 2,559.99 and the Nasdaq Composite added 78.54 points, or 1.05%, to 7,580.92.
""I have been in this business almost 30 years and this is the fastest correction I have seen,"" Swiss private bank Lombard Odier's chief investment officer, Stephane Monier, said of this year's plunge in global markets.
In oil markets, Brent futures were down 8%, or $2, at $22.50 a barrel - their lowest in 18 years. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures fell as far as $19.92, near a 2002 low hit this month.
Investors continued to seek the perceived safety of bonds, with bond yields falling in Europe and the United States. Benchmark 10-year notes last rose 35/32 in price to yield 0.6336%, down from 0.744% late on Friday.
The drop in yields has combined with efforts by the Federal Reserve to pump more U.S. dollars into markets, dragging the dollar off recent highs.
Rodrigo Catril, a senior FX strategist at National Australia Bank (NAB), said the main question for markets was whether all the stimulus would be enough to help the global economy withstand the shock from the coronavirus pandemic.
""To answer this question, one needs to know the magnitude of the containment measures and for how long they will be implemented,"" he added. 

""This is the big unknown, and it suggests markets are likely to remain volatile until this uncertainty is resolved.""

ZURICH (Reuters) - UBS Group (S:UBSG) intends to pay its 2019 dividend, the Swiss bank said on Monday, despite guidance from markets supervisor FINMA, the Swiss government and international banking groups to limit payouts as the coronavirus outbreak hits the global economy.
The lender's proposed dividend of $0.73 in cash per share is up nearly 6% over 2018 and foresees a payment of $2.6 billion after the bank posted a net profit attributable to shareholders of $4.3 billion last year. It reflects a roughly 8% return on the bank's share price that has fallen some 30% since February.
The shares were down more than 3% at 8.78 Swiss francs in early trading on Monday. 
""UBS has a strong capital basis and is strategically well positioned, which is especially crucial in this difficult time,"" UBS said. ""UBS, as the largest Swiss bank, is in a position to support the economy while maintaining an appropriate dividend policy.""
The bank's move comes as banking supervisors and regulators urge financial houses to reconsider payouts to investors.
The European Central Bank told euro zone banks on Friday to skip dividend payments and share buybacks until October, suggesting that they should instead use their profits to support an economy ravaged by the virus outbreak.
Global financial institutions including ABN Amro (AS:ABNd), the Bank of Ireland, ING (AS:INGA), Rabobank [RABOVR.UL] and Italy's UniCredit (MI:CRDI) have all said they would follow the ECB's advice.
UBS was rescued a decade ago by the Swiss federal government with a 6 billion Swiss franc ($6.28 billion) capital injection during the financial industry crisis.
It is still facing an order by a French court to pay 4.5 billion euros ($4.98 billion) after being found guilty of laundering proceeds of tax evasion in 2019, a ruling it is appealing.
Chief Financial Officer Kirt Gardner said earlier this month that UBS was comfortable with its liquidity levels despite sharp falls in equity markets.
FINMA APPEAL
FINMA said two weeks ago that Switzerland's financial institutions were well equipped to deal with extreme stress scenarios and continued to function, although Chief Executive Mark Branson cautioned last week that banks should exercise restraint on payouts..
""It is not a ban, it is an appeal,"" Branson said, as the Swiss government announced a 20 billion franc lending programme for coronavirus-hit businesses. ""We are asking the boards to decide who needs the money more - Swiss clients or international and institutional investors.""
The Swiss government said it supported the recommendations from the Swiss National Bank and FINMA regarding dividend payments and bonuses.
At the weekend, Bank of International Settlements general manager Agustin Carstens also said in an opinion piece that ""a global freeze on bank dividends and share buybacks"" was needed, in the face of coronavirus uncertainty.
Voting rights at UBS' annual general meeting on April 29 can be exercised only through the independent proxy, as shareholders cannot physically participate, the bank said.

 Commerzbank AG  (DE:CBKG) became the latest European bank to bow to pressure from regulators and scrap a dividend.
The German lender said it will not propose a dividend for 2019 at this year’s annual general meeting, according to a statement on Monday. “For the current fiscal year 2020, the management board will not plan for a dividend payment until the uncertainties of COVID 19 have ended.”
The German lender had stuck with its dividend proposal of 0.15 euros ($0.17) per share over the weekend even after the European Central Bank on Friday asked banks to delay payouts until at least October as the pandemic wreaks havoc on markets. Andrea Enria, the central bank’s top supervisor, said it would be socially irresponsible to continue paying dividends “in these exceptional times.”
The German government on Monday added its voice to the chorus of opponents, saying companies tapping state aid should suspend payouts to investors.
Banks have received unprecedented relief this month after the ECB temporarily allowed them to tap capital buffers and gave them more time to tackle soured loans. However, few lenders initially agreed to increase reserves by delaying or suspending payouts after the central bank issued a less strongly worded statement just calling on them to be “prudent” when deciding dividends.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened the week mostly higher, albeit paring early gains and trading generally in more nuanced fashion than has been usual in recent sessions, amid bargain-hunting and hopes for rapid progress in finding effective treatments to contain the Covid-19 outbreak.
By 10:15 AM (1415 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 191 points, or 0.9% at 21,828 points. The S&P 500 was up 1.5% and theNASDAQ Composite was up 1.9%.
The market took in its stride a sharp change in rhetoric on Sunday evening from President Donald Trump, who acknowledged the risk of up to 200,000 U.S. deaths from the virus, even under the measures taken so far to combat it.
Trump pushed back until the end of April the timeline for lifting the administration’s current guidance on social distancing, having earlier wanted the economy to be functioning as close as possible to normal by Easter (April 12).
With the prospect of extended lockdowns in Europe and the further spread of the virus across much of the emerging world, analysts are still revising down their expectations for the world economy this year. Analysts at consultancy IHS Markit said on Monday they now expect the U.S. economy to shrink by 5.4% this year due to the pandemic, with drops of 4.5% in the euro zone and U.K. and growth of only 2% in China. Chief economist Nariman Behravesh said in e-mailed comments that while recent responses in economic policy ""are probably not big enough"" to stop the economy shrinking, they will ""act as circuit-breakers and prevent the COVID-19 recession from becoming far worse.""
Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) stock was up 5.4% after the company said it plans to start testing its experimental coronavirus vaccine on humans by September, with an eye to having it approved for use early next year. the drugmaker said on Monday.
J&J also said it will invest than $1 billion together with U.S. agency Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) to co-fund vaccine research.
Abbott Labs (NYSE:ABT) stock was up 8.2% after the company said the Food and Drug Administration has issued Emergency Use Authorization for a Covid-19 test that it says can deliver positive results in as little as five minutes and negative ones in less than a quarter of an hour.
Zoom Video (NASDAQ:ZM) stock was up another 5.4% after a 7.5% rise on Friday as investors continued to pour into the ultimate ‘working-from-home’ beneficiary.
The maker of videoconferencing software is now valued at $42 billion, or over 56 times last year’s sales, spurring talk of an unsustainable bubble.
Slack Technologies (NYSE:WORK) stock was up 1.5% at its highest since August, another play on the boom in remote working, albeit at a less stretched multiple of 25 times trailing 12-month sales.
Oil and gas stocks continued to struggle as crude prices slipped to 17-year lows on the prospect of demand being suppressed for longer than hoped. 
Occidental Petroleum  (NYSE:OXY) stock was down 11.3% while  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM) stock was down 1.6% and  Chevron  Corp (NYSE:CVX) stock was down 1.3%

255,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 30, 2020 09:25AM ET</span>",Lockdown set to stymie Fiat attempt to restart some Italian production,"MILAN (Reuters) - A probable extension of Italy's lockdown could frustrate an attempt by  Fiat  Chrysler (MI:FCHA) to resume some vehicle production at three Italian plants next week, a union representative said on Monday.
Italy has banned travel within the country and ordered a freeze on all non-essential business activities, including the car industry, until April 3 to curb the spread of coronavirus which has now killed almost 11,000 people in the country.
FCA informed unions last week that if the government gave it the go-ahead, the automaker would be ready to resume some of its operations on April 6, Gianluca Ficco, a representative for metal workers union UILM, said.
The sites concerned would be the assembly line for the Jeep Compass at the Melfi facility in southern Italy, Atessa's plant making light commercial vehicles in central Italy and preparatory operations for the new electric 500 in Turin's Mirafiori factory, he said.
Ficco however said he did not know whether the government would allow non-essential activities to restart next week and thought Rome was more likely to extend the ban. 
Despite hopes among Italian officials that the downward trend in coronavirus fatalities nationally would continue, it appeared increasingly likely that restrictions would be soon officially extended.
On Sunday Regional Affairs Minister Francesco Boccia said the government would ""inevitably"" extend containment measures beyond April 3.
Italian media have reported that the extension could last for a further two weeks until about April 18.
A spokesman for FCA confirmed on Monday that for now, the plan was to resume those three facilities next week. 
Ficco added that, in any case, when operations restarted FCA would have to make sure that the highest health and safety conditions are assured in all factories.
Luxury carmaker  Ferrari  (MI:RACE), which, like FCA, is controlled by Exor (MI:EXOR), the investment firm of Italy's Agnelli family, said on Friday it would reopen its two Italian plants on April 14, provided it had supplies.

Exor said last week that current plant closures at companies it controls, though temporary, might continue.

259,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 30, 2020 07:30AM ET</span>",Activist investor makes new push for HC2 board to remove chief Falcone: letter,"BOSTON (Reuters) - An activist investor is stepping up calls for the board of HC2 Holdings Inc (N:HCHC) to remove Chief Executive and Chairman Philip Falcone as the former hedge fund manager faces mounting legal and financial troubles.
MG Capital, run by former Third Point executive Michael Gorzynski, said for the second time in two months that it wants Falcone out. Gorzynski asked lead independent director Wayne Barr in a letter seen by Reuters a ""to facilitate the removal of Mr. Falcone.""
In February the fund, which owns 5% of HC2 along with its partners, criticized the company's financial performance and said it wanted to replace the entire board, including Falcone, with six directors of its own.
Now, Gorzynski is focusing more on Falcone, whose bets on the overheated housing market at his Harbinger Capital turned him, briefly, into a billionaire. Last year his net worth was closer to $300 million, he told lawyers.
""Based on Mr. Falcone's well-documented financial, legal and regulatory issues, MG Capital - and presumably other stockholders - remains perplexed by the incumbent Board's focus on preserving HC2's status quo,"" MG Capital said in the letter.
HC2 has businesses in construction, marine services and several other sectors. A spokesman for the firm was not immediately available for comment.
An MG spokesman confirmed the content of the letter.
In the last six weeks, Falcone has been sued for more than $65.8 million for allegedly defaulting on loans and had his assets frozen for failing to pay lawyers. Last year HC2 was ordered by a court to withhold some of Falcone's wages to satisfy unpaid obligations after he was ordered to pay New York City $2.69 million in unpaid taxes.
""We remain deeply troubled by the impact that Mr. Falcone's apparent financial distress and legal issues may have on HC2,"" MG Capital said. 
In papers filed Feb. 21 with the New York State Supreme Court in Manhattan, Melody Business Finance LLC said Falcone and affiliates reneged on obligations to repay loans, which date from 2013 to 2017, and improperly sold some of the underlying collateral, including an Andy Warhol painting.
Alex Spiro, a partner at Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan representing Falcone, said in an statement: ""This is a personal dispute without merit. We will fight this.""
In early March, Justice Arthur Engoron froze Falcone's assets after he failed to pay $13.6 million to law firm Dontzin Nagy & Fleissig.
The firm represented Falcone in 2013 when he settled allegations with the Securities and Exchange Commission that he borrowed $113 million from his hedge fund to pay personal taxes and gave preferential treatment to certain clients when he halted redemptions.

Gorzynski in the letter to Barr said MG would ""engage in a constructive one-to-one dialogue with you and the other directors once Mr. Falcone has been removed.""

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are set to open mixed Monday, but the overall tone remains one of caution as hopes for an early release from the lockdown policies to combat the spread of the coronavirus disappear.
At 7:25 AM ET (1125 GMT), futures for the S&P 500 traded 10 points, or 0.4%, higher, futures for the Nasdaq up 0.5%, while the Dow futures contract was up 0.2%. 
Overnight, President Donald Trump abandoned his hope of lifting social distancing restrictions on the U.S. economy by Easter, which falls on April 12 this year, extending the current guidance on social distancing to the end of April. Trump's press conference on Sunday marked an abrupt change of emphasis. As recently as last week, the president had appeared to prioritize getting the country back to work, in spite of the contagion risk.
White House medical adviser Dr. Anthony Fauci had earlier warned that the virus could kill up to 200,000 Americans. U.S. coronavirus cases surged over 140,000 Sunday, with more than 2,500 people having died.
Trump said while 100,000 is ""a horrible number,"" if the U.S. can keep its death toll to ""100,000, so we have between 100,000 and 200,000, we altogether have done a very good job.""
Trading is likely to remain volatile given the uncertainty surrounding the virus outbreak and the associated economic damage.
The S&P 500 gained just over 10% last week, its biggest weekly win since 2009, while the Dow’s 12.8% weekly gain was its biggest since 1938. That said, even with these gains, the Dow is still on course for its biggest monthly loss since 1998, while the S&P and NASDAQ Composite are set for their worst months since 2008.
Turning to corporate news,  Abbott Laboratories  (NYSE:ABT) posted strong gains premarket, up around 12%, after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration authorized the medical device maker to produce a coronavirus test that delivers positive results in as little as five minutes.
The company expects the tests to be available next week and expects to ramp up manufacturing to deliver 50,000 tests per day.
Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) will also be in focus on reports workers plan to strike at its Staten Island warehouse amid demands for protection against the coronavirus.
Amazon shares rose 1% in premarket trade.
There is little in the way of important economic data due for release Monday, but the U.S. {{ecl-227||nonfarm payrolls} }report for March is due Friday. However, the collection of this data likely preceded the worst of the impact on the labor market. 
Ahead of that, Thursday’s  jobless claims report is expected to show another massive wave of new claims for unemployment benefits in the week to March 28, after they surged to a record 3.28 million in the preceding week.
Oil slumped to an 18-year low overnight, as the coronavirus pandemic continued to hit economic growth and oil demand.
At 7:05 AM ET (1105 GMT), U.S. crude futures traded 5.6% lower at $20.30 a barrel, dipping briefly below $20 overnight. The international benchmark Brent contract fell 6% to $26.27.

262,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 30, 2020 06:35AM ET</span>",Exclusive: American Airlines in talks to hire Millstein for aid advice,"By Mike Spector and Jessica DiNapoli
NEW YORK (Reuters) -  American Airlines Group  Inc (O:AAL) is in advanced talks to hire Guggenheim Securities co-chairman James Millstein for advice on tapping a $50 billion industry relief package available from the U.S. Treasury Department to cope with the coronavirus pandemic, people familiar with the matter said.
Millstein is one of Wall Street's most seasoned debt restructuring bankers and from 2009 to 2011 was the chief architect of the Obama administration's overhaul of certain financial firms the government had bailed out, including insurance giant American International Group Inc (N:AIG). 
While American Airlines has said it has not yet decided whether it will seek U.S. government aid, Millstein's anticipated appointment indicates the largest U.S. airline is actively preparing for such a move and girding for negotiations with Treasury officials.
Coronavirus relief legislation enacted last week provides up to $25 billion in loans and loan guarantees for U.S. airlines that have suffered from an unprecedented decline in passengers, with an additional $25 billion available in direct cash grants that could result in the U.S. government receiving ownership stakes in the companies.
Were Millstein to be hired, he would be advising American Airlines on the form and terms of aid it should pursue and how to navigate the U.S. Treasury Department's process for requesting the financial assistance, the sources said. Advice given to the Fort Worth, Texas-based company would be done in his own capacity, independent of Guggenheim, the sources added. 
The sources cautioned that no decision on American Airlines accepting U.S. government aid had yet been made and requested anonymity to discuss the confidential preparations.
American Airlines declined to comment, while Millstein did not respond to a request for comment.
American Airlines said last week it would be slashing its capacity 60% in April compared with the same period a year ago and up to 80% in May due to a dramatic reduction in customers and travel restrictions to curb the spread of coronavirus. Its shares have lost roughly half their value in the last five weeks, giving it a market capitalization of about $6 billion.
The company disclosed this month it had access to more than $7.3 billion of liquidity. Its long-term debt as of the end of December totaled about $23.9 billion.
American Airlines Chief Executive Doug Parker said last week that the company would be eligible for up to $12 billion in total U.S. aid. He added that combining government relief with a ""relatively high available cash position"" would ""allow us to ride through even the worst of potential future scenarios.""
Some terms of the cash grants ""aren't currently well defined,"" Parker said, adding that the company was not yet certain it would meet the conditions necessary to receive those funds. He said he expected the aid terms ""will not be onerous.""
Millstein, a former  Lazard Ltd  (N:LAZ) banker, has worked on bankruptcies and other challenges facing many U.S. conglomerates over the last two decades, including representing unionized workers in labor negotiations with General Motors Co (N:GM) and other automakers.
Millstein sold his restructuring advisory firm to Guggengeim in 2018. He most recently advised Puerto Rico on its debt woes, as well as California on how to best grapple with catastrophic wildfires and the bankruptcy of power utility PG&E Corp (N:PCG).
Millstein worked with Parker when he advised US Airways on its merger with American as part of the latter's bankruptcy reorganization in 2013. Parker was CEO of US Airways before assuming the same role in the combined company.
POTENTIAL STRINGS ATTACHED
Should American Airlines seek government aid, it may be forced to accept conditions. Requirements for airlines receiving cash grants include continuing to fly in and out of all U.S. airports that currently have commercial air service, and agreeing to avoid involuntary furloughs of employees, both through the end of September. 
The aid would also include restrictions on executive compensation and stock buybacks, as well as suspension of dividend payments. Similar strings are attached to government loans.

United Airlines Holdings Inc (O:UAL) and Delta Air Lines (N:DAL), the other two largest U.S. carriers, have expressed cautious optimism about the government assistance, while warning further measures would be required to stabilize their businesses.

LONDON (Reuters) - British budget airline easyJet (L:EZJ) has grounded its fleet of 344 planes and has no clear idea when it might resume flights, it said on Monday, highlighting the strain on airlines trying to survive the coronavirus pandemic. 
EasyJet said it would lay off its 4,000 UK-based cabin crew for two months, meaning they won't work from April 1 but will get 80% of their average pay under a state job retention scheme. 
The global health crisis has brought European air travel to a standstill, leaving airlines with no revenue and facing a struggle for survival. Small British airline Loganair, for example, said on Monday that it would seek state support. 
Shares in easyJet lost as much as 10% in early trading on Monday, having halved in value over the last month. The airline now has a market capitalisation of about 2.3 billion pounds ($2.9 billion). Its shares were down 5% at 0937 GMT.
""We think the group has enough liquidity to manage a short suspension of European air travel but if the disruption proves prolonged, or the recovery is sluggish, easyJet could be in real trouble,"" said Hargreaves Landsdown analyst William Ryder. 
EasyJet was under additional pressure from its biggest shareholder, Stelios Haji-Ioannou, who along with his family owns about a third of its shares. 
In a letter to easyJet's chairman on Sunday, Haji-Ioannou said it must cancel or renegotiate a 4.5 billion pound order for 107 Airbus planes because the extra aircraft would just destroy shareholder value.
EasyJet said it was trying to reduce payments, including those on aircraft, and would respond to the letter privately. 
The airline said it was focused on short-term liquidity, including removing costs from the business and working with suppliers to defer and reduce payments where possible. 
It said grounding its fleet removed significant costs and that it was continuing to talk to UK pilots union BALPA over a potential deal with pilots.
""We are working tirelessly to ensure that easyJet continues to be well positioned to overcome the challenges of coronavirus,"" easyJet CEO Johan Lundgren said in a statement.
HELP NEEDED

“Chartered prices have been pushed up from less than $300,000 four to six weeks back to $600,000 to $800,000 in the last few days,” Anthony Lau, chairman and founder of logistics company Pacific Air (HK) Ltd., said in an interview Friday. “It is absolutely crazy.”
Usually, it would cost $300,000 to charter a Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co. 747 or 777 from Hong Kong to Europe in non-peak season, Lau said.
“The price is changing by the hour. We have never, ever experienced this.” -- Anthony Lau.
An unprecedented collapse in passenger demand is prompting airlines to use their fleets to transport more cargo, including medicines, as the coronavirus pandemic causes major disruptions to supply chains and exacts a heavy toll on the world. Infections globally have climbed above 720,000 and about 34,000 people have died from the virus.
The likes of Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd., Korean Air Lines Co. and American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) Group Inc. are hauling a greater amount of goods in the bellies of their passenger planes to keep up with demand. Cargo rates have risen over 10% in recent weeks.

(Reuters) - European stock markets headed lower on Monday, as fears about the economic hit from the coronavirus pandemic intensified with several nations extending near-total lockdowns.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index (STOXX) was down 0.9%, with autos (SXAP), financials (SXFP) and insurers (SXIP) shedding between 1.2% and 2.3%.
The banking index (SX7P) slumped another 2.7%, bringing its total losses for the month to nearly 30%, as lenders complied with the European Central Bank's call to freeze dividends in a bid to shore up credit.
""There's a little bit of profit taking after the rally last week, but now people are also saying, 'let's see whether (the stimulus measures) will be successful and we're going to see a sort of a manageable economic hit',"" said Jakob Christensen, chief analyst at Danske Bank.
The benchmark European index ended Friday with one of its best weekly percentage gains since the 2008-09 financial crisis, as a raft of global stimulus measures offered hope that the economic damage from the outbreak could be contained.
However, the index was still set for its worst first quarter on record, losing more than $3.3 trillion in value, as a rapid increase in the number of coronavirus cases forced governments to extend containment measures that have brought business activity to a grinding halt. 
""If you've spent any time ocean fishing, you're probably aware of the term 'sucker hole', a colloquial term referring to a short spate of good weather that 'suckers' fisherman into leaving port just in time for a storm to resume at full force,"" said Stephen Innes, a trader at Axicorp.
""That's what last week's market felt like as now we are about to enter a vortex of bad earnings, bad economic data and bankruptcies.""
The speed with which the virus has spread across the globe has raised fears of a slate of corporate defaults, resulted in mass layoffs and brought whole sectors to the brink of collapse.
Travel and leisure stocks (SXTP), among the worst hit from the virtual halt in global travel, tumbled 2.3% on Monday as JP Morgan forecast a 42% slump in aftermarket sales in the European civil aerospace sector in 2020.

267,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 30, 2020 05:31AM ET</span>","StockBeat: Markets Adjust to a Deeper, Longer Covid-19 Dip","By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- Europe’s stock markets have lurched lower on Monday, forced to adjust their horizons after President Donald Trump – who embodied what gung ho spirit there was among global leaders with regard to the coronavirus – was forced to change his position and abandon his hope of getting the U.S. economy up and running again by Easter.
In Europe, the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic had already made any such thinking fantasy. The U.K., which initially thought it could – in Trump’s words - ‘ride this sucker’, fell into line with the rest of Europe last week in enforcing a stringent shutdown of non-essential business. The U.K.’s deputy chief medical officer said at the weekend that restrictions could stay in place for six months.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel said in her regular podcast on Sunday that there was no sign of any improvement that would justify lifting the shutdown in Europe’s biggest economy yet. Germany is halfway through a two-week lockdown that now seems certain to be extended.
""The longer the crisis goes on, the less the economy will look like it does today,"" Paul Donovan, chief economist with UBS Global Wealth Management, warned in a morning note.
In short, this ‘sucker’ is going to cause a longer, and probably deeper, dip in economic activity than was assumed even at the end of last week. Hence the fresh rout in oil prices this morning – Brent has fallen 4.9% to a 17-year low of $24.16 a barrel.
Against this background, more and more companies and financial institutions are taking more and more extreme measures to conserve cash. EasyJet said it will ground its entire fleet on Monday and apply for an assistance scheme under which the government will pay up to 80% of staff wages (up to a certain threshold). EasyJet shares slumped another 5.4% and dragged the rest of the U.K.-exposed travel sector down with it: IAG (LON:ICAG) shares were down 5.4%, Dart Group shares fell 7.1%, while Ryanair (LON:RYA) shares fell 6.4% and On the Beach shares fell 4.4%.
Banks, too, are suspending their dividends en masse after a ‘recommendation’ from the European Central Bank on Friday to stop payouts to shareholders until October. Unicredit (MI:CRDI), ING and ABN AMRO (AS:ABNd), among others, have all dutifully complied. UBS Group (NYSE:UBS) – which isn’t regulated by the ECB – has however, stuck to its guns and said it will pay out its 2019 dividend in full.
Unicredit shares and ING Group (AS:INGA) shares were both down 5.3%, while ABN AMRO shares were down 7.0% after the bank threw in a warning of a hefty loss for good measure.  Barclays  (LON:BARC) shares and Lloyds (LON:LLOY) shares also underperformed amid expectations of similar measures, and amid broader pressure from the U.K.’s sovereign debt downgrade from Fitch Ratings on Friday."

The passenger travel industry has been decimated by the coronavirus pandemic and SAS is the latest in a string of airlines around the world starting to offer cargo charter services on passenger planes to boost revenue.
""This flight provides a much-needed opportunity for Scandinavian companies to export cargo to (the) US and back, ensuring the industrial wheels keep moving,"" SAS subsidiary SAS Cargo Group said in a statement. 
Around half the world's air cargo normally travels in passenger planes rather than dedicated freighters, so the cancellation of passenger flights has led to a sharp reduction in cargo capacity.
""SAS is currently getting a lot of inquiries about ad-hoc flights for passengers and cargo. We are looking at these requests and prioritizing the traffic that is most needed to support both our society and our customers,"" SAS Cargo CEO Leif Rasmussen said.

Shionogi will form a joint venture with the Chinese group's unit, Ping An Life Insurance of China Ltd, with the aim of discovering and distributing new drugs and developing generic ones as it looks to expand in China, it said in a statement.
""To attain our growth strategy beyond 2020, we must realize the expansion of our business in China, which is expected to show the greatest pharmaceutical market growth in the world over the next 10 years,"" Shionogi said in the statement.
Shionogi, which gains roughly half its revenue from royalties, posted four-straight years of record operating profit through 2019. It focuses on infectious diseases but a looming patent cliff for its HIV treatments will create an earnings gap that will be hard to completely offset.
Ping An Insurance Group, China's largest insurer by market value, said in February it expected the coronavirus outbreak to affect its business in the first half.

270,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 30, 2020 04:00AM ET</span>","China's big banks flag asset pressure due to virus, boding ill for smaller kin","By Cheng Leng and Engen Tham
BEIJING/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China's largest state banks said the impact of restrictions on movement imposed to slow the spread of the coronavirus could pull down asset quality as borrowers struggle to repay loans, though they are likely big enough to weather any fallout.
The comments come as four of the country's largest state-backed lenders posted estimate-beating fourth-quarter profit - but they bode ill for smaller lenders, who have less capital reserves and can call on fewer state borrowers.
The outbreak beginning at the end of last year has left many airlines, hotels and other businesses fighting to survive after government countermeasures all but paralyzed economic activity for over a month.
China's largest lenders - Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Ltd (ICBC) (SS:601398) (HK:1398), China Construction Bank Corp (CCB) (SS:601939) (HK:0939) and Bank of Communications Co Ltd (BoCom) (SS:601328) (HK:3328) - posted annual profit growth of over 4% for 2019 due in part to improving asset quality. 
A prolonged pandemic might break the upward trend with rising soured debt and shrinking net interest margins (NIM), a gauge of banks' profitability, senior bankers said.
""We expect there will be an increase in overdue loans in the first quarter and first half,"" Bank of China Ltd's (SS:601988) (HK:3988) Chief Risk Officer Liu Jiandong said after the lender published annual results on Friday. The bank's president added that the impact is likely to be short-term and controllable. 
ICBC President Gu Shu likewise said the outbreak ""will put some pressure on our asset quality,"" but that the lender is confident on its overall situation.
Big-bank confidence is down in part to plush capital reserves which can help ease the impact of a downturn.
The provision coverage ratio at ICBC was 212.53% at the end of December, compared with 198.09% three months prior. CCB's ratio rose to 227.56% from 218.28% in the same period.
China's largest banks have also benefited from preferential government policies such as support to tackle bad loans. They often lend to the biggest state-owned firms which are less risky and which helps buoy profit even during economic downturn.
Smaller lenders, by comparison, have had a tougher time.
Inner Mongolia lender Baoshang Bank Co Ltd was rescued by the government in May and there was a run on Yingkou and Yichuan Rural Commercial Bank in November.
""We estimate non-performing loans will total 250 billion yuan ($35.23 billion) in the best-case scenario as a result of the outbreak,"" said analyst Liao Zhiming at TF Securities.
Smaller banks with lower capital reserves are likely to struggle the most.
""The pattern of low provisions, high non-performing loans and high overdue loans suggests rural commercial banks are short of capital,"" Gavekal Dragonomics said in a client note.
On Monday, Moody's Investors Service changed its view of the outlook of six Chinese banks, including Bank of Nanjing Co Ltd (SS:601009) and the Bank of Ningbo Co Ltd (SZ:002142), to negative, citing the impact of the virus through exposure to highly affected industries such as manufacturing and trade. 
Overall, the NIM of banks is likely to keep narrowing, bankers and analysts said, as the government and central bank urge lenders to sacrifice profit to support companies during the downturn.
At BoCom, the NIM was slightly wider at the end of December than three months earlier. It narrowed at ICBC and CCB and was steady at BoC.

Senior BOC and ICBC officials also flagged risk relating to recent global market turmoil, saying contingency plans would be in place to curb credit and operational risk abroad.

271,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 30, 2020 04:00AM ET</span>",Shares of a German Ventilator Manufacturer Are Soaring,"(Bloomberg) -- A crushing global shortage of ventilators needed to treat coronavirus patients has sent a German smallcap stock soaring, leaving analysts scrambling to value both the shares and the company’s ability to help combat the crisis.
While major German indexes have lost between 17% and 28% in 2020, shares of Draegerwerk AG & Co KGaA (D:DRWGg) have gained about 70%, taking off in mid-March after Germany ordered 10,000 ventilators and other medical equipment from the company. M.M. Warburg analyst Eggert Kuls estimates that each ventilator costs about 20,000 euros, making the deal worth 200 million euros ($221 million) in revenue for Draeger.
“The ventilator super cycle could yield more upside,” for Draeger, Hauck & Aufhaeuser analyst Aliaksandr Halitsa wrote in a note last week, upgrading the stock to hold from sell. Halitsa estimates that the new ventilator demand will add 230 million euros to Draeger’s 2020 sales and will help boost earnings before interest and tax for the group to 173 million euros. The company reported 2.78 billion euros in revenue last year and 66.6 million euros in Ebit.
The problem, however, is that production capacity for ventilators is limited, and so are supplies needed to make them, so churning out more of the much-needed machines is not straightforward. Draeger has added a second shift producing ventilators and may switch to three shifts producing 24 hours a day for this specific product line, spokesman Peter Mueller said. The company will hire more staff and may relocate workers from other areas to assemble the machines.
Still, medical products need testing before being shipped to hospitals, and another bottleneck the company is facing is with the equipment needed for the 24-hour tests the finished devices have to undergo, Mueller said. Some electronic parts also come from Asia, where supply chains were disrupted, he said.
Draeger does not disclose how much revenue it makes from ventilators or how many units it sells per year. It generated 1.74 billion euros in revenue, or 63% of its total, from medical devices last year, which includes other major product groups, such as incubators and anesthesia devices. Draeger also makes personal protection equipment for hospital staff, including medical masks.
While the pandemic creates an “exceptional boom” for ventilators, the share-price gain may have gone too far, according to Bankhaus Metzler analyst Alexander Neuberger, as Draeger will struggle to fully convert the market potential into sales. Even after expanding capacities, Draeger will generate no more than a mid single-digit percentage of its revenue from ventilators, he said.
For now, the shares’ performance has surpassed all analysts’ expectations: of the four analysts that issued or repeated price targets on the stock this month, the average is 61.25 euros, or 33% below where it is currently trading.
“Production capacity is the limiting factor,” Metzler’s Neuberger said in an interview. “The large order from the German government alone fully uses the existing capacities for two years.”

In an unusually blunt statement, the global umbrella group for exchanges and clearing houses said bourses already have safeguards like circuit breakers to slow markets during bouts of extreme volatility.
Several European Union countries, including Spain, Italy, France and Belgium have banned traders borrowing a company stock with a view to selling it, hoping to buy it back later at a lower price and pocket the difference, a practice that critics say can exacerbate market moves amid panic selling.
""Banning short-selling interferes with price formation, thereby increasing uncertainty,"" WFE Chief Executive Nandini Sukumar said in a statement.
""It is not – and never has been – true that bans have any other, positive effect on market activity or price levels.""
Britain has refused to ban short-selling, saying there is no evidence that it was a driver of market routs. The United States has not introduced such a curb, but traders say Germany has been under pressure to introduce a ban and has so far resisted.
""Falling prices indicate that companies are expected to be less profitable in the future,"" WFE said. ""But even in a declining market, short-selling is only a small part of market activity, notably compared with sales of existing long positions.""

Investing.com - European stock markets fell sharply on Monday, weighed on by President Donald Trump's decision to abandon his plans for an early reopening of the U.S. economy as the coronavirus pandemic showed no signs of abating.
At 3:55 ET (0745 GMT), the U.K.'s FTSE index was trading 3.7% lower, France's CAC 40 was down 3.0%, while the DAX fell 1.8%. The broader based Stoxx 600 Europe index dropped 2.4%.  
The tone within the market remains cautious as the number of Covid-19 infections headed rapidly towards 750,000 worldwide. The number of deaths from the virus in Italy, the epicenter of the outbreak in Europe, is now well over 10,000, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.
Overnight, President Donald Trump had abandoned his hope of lifting restrictions on the U.S. economy by Easter, extending the current guidance on social distancing to the end of April. Trump said while 100,000 is ""a horrible number,"" if the U.S. can keep its death toll to ""100,000, so we have between 100,000 and 200,000, we altogether have done a very good job.""
Earlier Monday, the People’s Bank of China cut the rate on 7-day reverse repos, which acts as an informal reference point for its other lending facilities, to 2.2% from 2.4%, the largest reduction in nearly five years. The PBoC injected 50 billion yuan ($7.04 billion) into the banking system through repos this week.
“We see this rate cut as a move to avoid a financial crisis because liquidity has been ample in the Chinese interbank market,” ING analyst Iris Pang said, in a research note.
There is a lot of economic data coming out of the euro zone this week. Monday’s March economic sentiment data, at 5 AM ET, will offer insights into how businesses and consumers assess the situation, even though the numbers predate new restrictive measures put in place since the survey was conducted.
In corporate news, UBS  (NYSE:UBS) announced that it is maintaining its previously announced dividend for 2019. However, Unicredit (MI:CRDI) and Dutch banks ING (AS:INGA) and ABN AMRO (AS:ABNd) (AS:ABNd) as well as the Bank of Ireland (LON:BIRG) all said they will suspend payouts to conserve cash.
The European auto sector will also be in focus Monday after Japan’s Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203) announced that it has suspended production in all its European factories.
French carmaker  Renault  (PA:RENA) followed suit, saying production at all its plants across the world had been halted due to the impact of the coronavirus crisis, apart from its plants in China and South Korea. Renault shares dropped 1.8%. 
In the U.K., EasyJet shares fell 9.3% after the airline said it will ground its fleet entirely, while public sector contractor  Kier Group  (LON:KIE) said it Monday will cut wages for about 6,500 employees, including executives and board members, by between 7.5% and 25% for the three months beginning April. Kier shares fell 2.2%.
Oil markets also tumbled to a 17-year low on Monday as the pandemic continued to hurt demand while a price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia remained unresolved.
At 3:35 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 6.0% lower, at $20.21 a barrel, on the prospect of lower U.S. fuel demand for longer. The international benchmark Brent contract fell 6.0% to $26.26.

UniCredit SpA (OTC:UNCRY) suspended a dividend payment and a share buyback in a setback to Chief Executive Officer Jean Pierre Mustier’s plan to improve shareholder rewards.
The decision comes after the European Central Bank on Friday recommended that lenders restrict payouts until at least October as the coronavirus pandemic wreaks havoc on markets. Its previous call for banks to be prudent on dividends persuaded few major banks to change their policies.
On Friday Andrea Enria, the ECB’s top banking watchdog, said it would be socially irresponsible to withhold dividends “in these exceptional times.” Italy’s Banca Generali (MI:GASI) SpA and Banca Mediolanum also announced delays to their payouts on Monday, as did Dutch Banks ABN Amro NV and  ING Groep  (AS:INGA) NV.
Mustier laid out a new strategy for UniCredit in December, promising that an increasing proportion of earnings would be paid out to shareholders via dividends and buybacks through 2023. Milan-based UniCredit had planned to distribute a dividend of 63 cents a share on 2019 earnings and the board had authorized the repurchase of as much as 467 million ($517 million) euros of shares.
The board will review its policies in October or if the European Central Bank changes its recommendation.
UniCredit will release the 2019 dividend deducted from its CET1 capital, boosting the measure by 37 basis points. The board will not yet accrue any dividend on 2020 earnings. The bank will offer its shareholder foundations interest-free loans equal to the amount of the planned dividends, its said in a separate state.

282,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 30, 2020 02:40AM ET</span>",Australia's top retail bank boss warns of sharp economic slowdown,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia faces a 10% economic contraction in the March quarter as shockwaves from the coronavirus pandemic rip through the economy, the head of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia (AX:CBA), the country's largest lender, warned on Monday.
Citing data from the bank's live payments system, CBA chief executive Matt Comyn said consumption has fallen heavily in recent weeks as widespread restrictions on the movement of people have hit demand. 
""Probably a base case for the March quarter would be something in the order of a 10% contraction in the economy,"" Comyn said in a video conference hosted by the Australian Financial Review on Monday. 
Comyn said a week or so ago he would have probably estimated a contraction of 5% to 6%.
Australia has rolled out increasingly restrictive measures to combat the spread of coronavirus. Around 4,200 people have tested positive nationally, and the death toll stands at 18.
The A$2 trillion ($1.2 trillion) economy has dodged a recession since the early 1990s but surging unemployment and higher loan losses are likely to cripple growth in what could be the country's steepest economic downturn. 
More than 100,000 Australian workers have already been stood down as retailers and restaurants shut shop, leading to ever longer queues outside the country's welfare office.
Australia's biggest banks are watching the impacts play out as they offer deferral periods on loans to beleaguered industries and consumers.
When asked if Australia's economic contraction in the June quarter could be in the order of 25% as some predict for the U.S. economy, Comyn said it was ""certainly possible.""
""Of course, I hope it does not come to that. And I think that is why the government has and will continue to put in place very substantial measures to enable businesses to stay intact.""
Australia is battening down the hatches to prevent a scarring economic crisis, with the country's central bank take a foray into quantitative easing after reducing interest rates to a record low of 0.25%. 
The government has also rolled out three fiscal stimulus packages totaling A$320 billion, with the latest on Monday offering ""job keeper"" payments to companies to help them keep people employed. 
Economists, in general, are predicting Australia's unemployment rate will soar above 11% by June and annual economic output will shrink by 3% in 2020.
The most recent data showed Australia's economy expanding by 2.2% in the December quarter from a year earlier, while the jobless rate fell to 5.1% in February.

The ECB told euro zone banks on Friday to skip dividend payments and share buybacks until the start of October at the earliest and to use capital instead to weather losses and to improve their ability to lend.
ING said it had taken its proposal for the dividend for 2019 off the agenda for its upcoming shareholders meeting and did not expect to pay an interim dividend over 2020.
Any announcement on further dividend payments would be reviewed after Oct. 1, the bank said.
ING's move followed that of fellow Dutch bank Rabobank and Italy's UniCredit (MI:CRDI) , which on Sunday said they would put dividend and share buyback plans on hold for at least six months.
""These are extraordinary times for all of us"", ING Chief Executive Ralph Hamers said.
""While we are well capitalized and funded, we think it is prudent to follow the ECB’s recommendations, enabling us greater flexibility to support our customers and society in this crisis and work together with governments and regulators toward a recovery.""
Hamers is set to leave ING at the end of June to become CEO of Swiss bank UBS (S:UBSG).
His new employer on Sunday said it was sticking to its previously announced dividend for 2019, despite markets supervisor FINMA urging it to reconsider the payout.

Investing.com - European stock markets are set to open cautiously higher Monday, rebounding after Friday’s sharp losses but weighed on by President Donald Trump's decision to abandon his plans for an early reopening of the U.S. economy.
At 2:30 ET (0630 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 1.7% higher. {{167|France's CACAC 40 futures were up 0.7%, while the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. rose 0.6%. 
The tone within the market remains one of caution, and futures pared early early gains, as the number of Covid-19 infections headed rapidly towards 750,000 worldwide. The number of deaths from the virus in Italy, the epicenter of the outbreak in Europe, is now well over 10,000, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.
Overnight, President Donald Trump had abandoned his hope of lifting restrictions on the U.S. economy by Easter, extending the current guidance on social distancing to the end of April. Trump said while 100,000 is ""a horrible number,"" if the U.S. can keep its death toll to ""100,000, so we have between 100,000 and 200,000, we altogether have done a very good job.""
Earlier Monday, the People’s Bank of China cut interest rates to 2.2% from 2.4%, the largest reduction in nearly five years, and announced plans to use 7-day reverse repurchase agreements to put  50 billion yuan ($7.04 billion) into the banking system.  
“This rate cut was unexpected. But the liquidity injection was even more of a surprise,” said ING analyst Iris Pang, in a research note. “The PBoC has not only stopped injecting any liquidity into the system since the 16th March but even withdrew CNY33 billion of liquidity on 28th March, a working day before this injection.”
“We see this rate cut as a move to avoid a financial crisis because liquidity has been ample in the Chinese interbank market,” Pang added.
The major European indexes all closed sharply lower Friday, with the U.K.'s FTSE index ending down 5.2%, France's CAC 40 down 4.2%, while the DAX fell 3.7%. 
There is a lot of economic data coming out of the eurozone this week. Monday’s March economic sentiment data, at 5 AM ET, will offer insights into how businesses and consumers assess the situation, even though the numbers predate new restrictive measures put in place since the survey was conducted.
In corporate news, UBS (NYSE:UBS) announced that it is maintaining its previously announced dividend for 2019. However, Dutch banks ING and ABN AMRO (AS:ABNd) said they will suspend payouts to conserve cash.
The European auto sector will also be in focus Monday after Japan’s Toyota Motor (T:7203) announced that it has suspended production in all its European factories.
Production will not resume until April 20 at the earliest, the company said on Monday. Toyota has seven factories in Europe - in France, the United Kingdom, the Czech Republic, Poland, Turkey, Portugal and Russia. The factories in Russia are the sole exemption and will be closed from March 30 to April 3.
Oil markets moved lower Monday as the pandemic continued to hurt demand while a price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia remained unresolved.
At 2:30 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 4.0% lower, on the prospect of lower U.S. fuel demand for longer, at $20.62 a barrel. The international benchmark Brent contract fell 4.1% to $26.81.
Elsewhere, gold futures fell 0.7% to $1,643.30/oz, while EUR/USD traded at 1.1093, down 0.4% on the day.

286,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 30, 2020 01:25AM ET</span>","Mortgage securities rebound as Fed starts buying, concerns persist","By Herbert Lash
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Mortgage-related shares rose and volatility dropped on Friday, a sign moves by the Federal Reserve had some positive effect on liquidity and coronavirus-related panic about securities linked to commercial and residential loans.
Mortgage Real Estate Investment Trusts (REIT) have been slammed this month on concerns that non-payment of loans will rise as U.S. economic activity grinds to a halt, and that the Fed is focusing its attention on thawing the market in U.S. Treasury debt and not enough on mortgage-backed securities.
Last weekend, Thomas Barrack, executive chairman of real estate investment company Colony Capital Inc. (N:CLNY), said the U.S. commercial real estate mortgage market ""stands on the brink of collapse"", and predicted ""domino effect"" of catastrophic consequences if banks and the government didn't take immediate action on COVID-19.
On Friday, in the first open market operation with a new commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) program, the New York Fed bought $1.04 billion of the $1.83 billion that was offered in a sign of eagerness by dealers to offload. The Fed said it would buy $3 billion in agency CMBS next week in similar operations.
Late Friday it said it will buy up to $40 billion a day next week of agency MBS, which are issued by National Mortgage Association (Ginnie Mae), Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae), and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac).
The spread between the performance of the 10-year U.S. Treasury note and indexes that track CMBS have narrowed since Tuesday, suggesting recent Fed actions have stopped a plunge in mortgage REITs - companies that issue loans or buy commercial or residential mortgage-backed securities (MBS) as investments.
(Graphic: CMBS performance with Fed moves link: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/4048/4004/Pasted%20Image.jpg).
The Fed on Monday rolled out an extraordinary array of programs to backstop an economy reeling from restrictions on commerce after its first emergency effort on March 3 and other actions failed to tamp down fears not enough was being done.
By Tuesday the Fed's big ""bazooka"" moment had turned around the U.S. equity markets, which began the biggest three-day rally since the Depression for the Dow industrials as a $2 trillion stimulus bill in Congress also gained traction.
 Invesco Mortgage  Capital (N:IVR) shares closed at $4.69 on Friday after plunging from a two-year high of $18.28 last month to a low of $2.46 on Wednesday. The stock only once before this month had traded below $10 a share in more than a decade.
MFA Financial (N:MFA) shares jumped 9.4% to $1.86 on Friday, up from an all-time low of 32 cents on Tuesday, after it too plummeted 96% from February. A prior low was $3.98 during the depths of the financial crisis in October 2008.
While the market turned around for mortgage REITs, analysts say more pain may come as some tenants are likely to stop paying rent when the economy slides sharply in April and May.
Rental revenue will go down as will occupancy levels, which may not be true for large enterprise tenants but it certainly will be challenging for the small, mid-sized businesses, said Ken Leon, director of equity research at CFRA who covers both banking and REITs, primarily in the office sector.
""The second quarter is going to be pretty ugly for commercial real estate,"" Leon said.
""Even in an optimistic scenario, which would be a V-shaped recovery sometime in the third quarter, the second quarter is probably going to be negatively impacted.""
How much debt is refinanced or payments delayed is still unknown, said Kevin Barker, a senior research analyst at Piper Sandler who covers mortgage and consumer finance companies.
The market had experienced forced selling on top of forced selling, which caused markets to be irrational and companies with good assets were forced to sell, Barker said.
""This is a story that causes a major change to how the market treats mortgage REITs going forward and how they view leverage and funding. We might have a much different industry six months from now than we do today,"" Barker said.

290,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 29, 2020 11:35PM ET</span>",Major airlines urge U.S. Treasury to disburse assistance quickly,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Major U.S. airlines asked the U.S. Treasury to move quickly to release up to $58 billion in government grants and loans and recommended a formula to divide up the money.
In a letter dated Saturday and seen by Reuters, carriers wrote that ""given the urgent and immediate need, it is essential that these funds be disbursed as soon as possible.""
The letter was signed by the chief executives of American Airlines (O:AAL), Delta Air Lines (N:DAL), United Airlines,  Alaska Air  Group (N:ALK), JetBlue Airways Corp (O:JBLU), Southwest Airlines Co (N:LUV), Hawaiian Airlines (O:HA) and  Atlas Air Worldwide  (O:AAWW). It was also signed by senior executives at UPS Corp (N:UPS) and FedEx (N:FDX) and the head of an airline trade association.
The $2.2 trillion stimulus and assistance legislation signed into law Friday by President Donald Trump gives passenger airlines $25 billion in cash assistance to cover payroll costs and $25 billion in loans, while cargo carriers are eligible for $4 billion in grants and $4 billion in loans.
Airlines had threatened to quickly start laying off tens of thousands of workers within days if they did not get a bailout. Treasury faces an April 1 deadline to issue procedures to airlines to apply for grants. 
The airlines said Treasury should allocate grants in accordance with salaries and benefits paid by carriers from April 1 through Sept. 30, 2019 and filed with the U.S. Transportation Department.
The letter suggested the loans be divided by each passenger carrier's pro rata share of ""system available seat miles"" for 2019 operations. For cargo carriers it said the loans should be divided by ""revenue ton miles"" for 2019 operations. 
Treasury did not respond Sunday to a request for comment on the letter.
The carriers' letter said executives looked forward to meeting with Treasury ""to discuss the specific terms"" but wanted to ""make clear that we are speaking with one voice when we propose these formula allocations.""
According to 2019 stock market filings for the top publicly-traded U.S. carriers, American Airlines paid the most in salaries and benefits at about $6.4 billion over a six-month period.
It was followed by United Airlines, Delta, Southwest, Alaska Airlines, JetBlue,  Spirit Airlines  (N:SAVE) and Hawaiian.
United, which flies long Asia-Pacific routes, recorded the most available seat miles (ASMs) at about 285,000 in 2019, followed by Delta, American, Southwest, Alaska, JetBlue, Spirit and Hawaiian.
American said last week it believed it was eligible for $12 billion in U.S. loans and grants.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump, who excoriated General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) on Friday and invoked emergency powers to compel the production of badly needed ventilators to tackle the coronavirus pandemic, has abruptly shifted gears to praise the automaker.
""General Motors is doing a fantastic job. I don't think we need to worry about General Motors,"" Trump said Sunday, speaking highly of the company in two appearances.
""They really seem to be working very, very hard. I think I’m getting very good reports about General Motors.""
Trump, who has been on the defensive for not moving faster to compel the production of medical equipment, invoked the Defense Production Act (DPA) for the first time on Friday, saying GM was wasting time in negotiations. GM had announced earlier on Friday, however, that it would begin quickly building ventilators.
On Sunday, GM vowed to move forward and released photos of its efforts to build ventilators at its Kokomo, Indiana plant.
GM's manufacturing chief, Gerald Johnson, told Reuters the company aims to produce 10,000 ventilators a month by summer.
""No later than mid-April we expect to be up and running ventilators,"" Johnson said, noting the ventilators will need U.S. regulatory approval, significant testing and that the company must train over 1,000 workers to assemble them.
GM has been working with ventilator firm Ventec Life Systems, numerous auto suppliers and other ventilator firms as officials warn the United States may need tens of thousands of additional ventilators.
""We're unwavering in our focus to get this done,"" Johnson said.
In any earlier tweet on Friday before GM's announcement, Trump accused the automaker of wanting top dollar for its ventilators.
A GM spokesman said the company is doing the project ""at cost"" and will not make a profit. 
Johnson said the automaker is spending tens of millions on retooling costs and that if supplier retooling costs are factored in, total retooling costs were in the hundreds of millions of dollars.
GM's ventilator efforts first came to light on March 18 when White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow disclosed he had spoken to GM Chief Executive Mary Barra about the idea. Barra spoke to Kudlow again on Friday after Trump's criticism, a person briefed on the matter said.
Tony Fratto, a former deputy press secretary under President George W. Bush, tweeted on Friday: ""you have to think if GM HADN’T stepped up to TRY to make ventilators no one would be trying to force them to make them. No one’s banging on other random companies today.""
Other automakers have said they are working to produce ventilators, masks and other medical equipment. Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co said Friday it was moving as fast as it could to gear up its ventilator manufacturing efforts. Toyota Motor Corp is working with ""at least two companies that produce ventilators and respirators to help increase their capacity.""

GM will also begin producing surgical masks at a plant in Michigan this week and expects to produce 50,000 a day by mid-April.

The ASX 200 saw the sole gain as it rose 1.79% by 10:33 PM ET (3:33 AM GMT). Treasurer Josh Frydenberg will announce further income support for workers later today as part of a third stimulus package as the coronavirus savages the economy.
He also announced tighter restrictions on foreign takeovers, with all proposed overseas investment in Australian businesses triggering government scrutiny regardless of the value.
China’s Shanghai Composite lost 1.22% while the Shenzhen Component was down by 2.9%. The National Bureau of Statistic will publish the country's latest manufacturing PMI numbers on Tuesday.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's Qantas Airways Ltd (AX:QAN) said on Monday that pilots had voted in favor of a pay deal that would pave the way for the airline to fly the world's longest non-stop commercial flights from Sydney to London.
Due to the coronavirus pandemic, the airline has canceled all its international flights through at least the end of May and pushed a decision on whether to order up to 12 Airbus SE (PA:AIR) A350-1000 planes for the Sydney-to-London flights to the end of the year from an earlier deadline of end-March.
""The extraordinary circumstances facing aviation has seen Airbus agree to extend the deadline on our decision to purchase the A350s so we can both focus on navigating the coronavirus crisis,"" Qantas Chief Pilot Dick Tobiano said in a statement.
""But when this period has passed, and it will, we will refocus our attention on Project Sunrise and the A350 order,"" he said. Qantas has named the ultra long-haul project ""Project Sunrise"" after the airline's double-sunrise endurance flights during World War Two.
If the order proceeds, the non-stop flights from Sydney to London and other far-away destinations like New York could start in the first half of 2023, allowing the airline to charge passengers a premium in return for avoiding a stop-over.
Mark Sedgwick, the president of the Australian and International Pilots Association (AIPA), the union representing Qantas pilots, said 85% had voted in favor of the agreement.
Earlier this month, AIPA told members the proposed pay deal was ""unsatisfactory"" but pilots should make their own call given an outsourcing threat and an uncertain economic climate, according to a memo.
The airline later announced plans to put two-thirds of its workforce on leave as it stopped international flights and made severe cuts to domestic flying.

""Our attention now turns to the immediate needs of member pilots during this global health crisis which has brought the aviation industry to its knees,"" AIPA's Sedgwick said in a statement. ""Although people will start flying again and demand will come back, no one knows when that is likely to be.""

OneWeb made the filing late Friday U.S. time after raising about $3.3 billion in debt and equity financing from shareholders including SoftBank, Airbus SE and Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc. since its inception. At least $1 billion of that came from SoftBank, which said it first invested in December 2016 and declined to give a total amount.
It is the latest blow to SoftBank founder Masayoshi Son, who last week unveiled a plan to raise $41 billion to buy back shares and slash debt. The announcement sent the shares soaring more than 50% in just a few days. The rally was interrupted when Moody’s Corp. cut its debt rating by two notches, saying the Japanese investment firm’s plan to sell off assets during a market downturn threatened its total value. SoftBank’s shares traded 6.7% lower on Monday morning in Tokyo.
Son had often pointed to OneWeb as one of the cornerstones of an investment portfolio that ranges from ride sharing, co-working and robotics to agriculture, cancer detection and autonomous driving. The startup was working on providing affordable high-speed access anywhere in the world and targeting 1 billion subscribers by 2025. Son has painted a picture of a future where satellite networks cover every inch of the Earth and a trillion devices connected to the internet disgorge data into the cloud where it is analyzed by artificial intelligence.
OneWeb listed liabilities and assets of more than $1 billion each in its Chapter 11 petition in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in White Plains, New York. The company had been in advanced discussions earlier in the year for a fresh investment, it said in a statement. But the discussions fell apart after the coronavirus pandemic sent markets into a tailspin, it said.
The company had been mulling a Chapter 11 filing even as it continued to review possible out-of-court alternatives, people with knowledge of the matter told Bloomberg News on March 19.
The satellite operator said it will pursue a sale process during the court reorganization and is in talks for so-called debtor-in-possession financing that would allow the company to fund its obligations during the proceedings.
OneWeb makes low-orbit satellites that provide high-speed communications. It faces high-profile competition, including from Elon Musk’s SpaceX Starlink project and Jeff Bezos’s Amazon-linked Project Kuiper effort, while incumbents in the space include Inmarsat, Intelsat SA and Eutelsat Communications SA.
At the time of its filing, OneWeb owed $238 million to Arianespace, its satellite launch operator, according to the court document. Arianespace, headquartered near Paris, describes itself on its website as the world’s first commercial space transportation company.

297,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 29, 2020 05:45PM ET</span>","Italy's UniCredit puts 2019 dividend, share buyback on hold after ECB recommendation","MILAN (Reuters) - Italy's biggest bank, UniCredit (MI:CRDI), said on Sunday it was putting on hold plans to pay dividends on 2019 results and to buy back shares to meet regulatory calls to preserve capital to support the economy against the coronavirus.
The European Central Bank told euro zone banks on Friday to skip dividend payments and share buybacks until the start of October at the earliest and use profits instead to boost capital and their ability to withstand losses and to lend.
UniCredit said it was withdrawing a proposal to shareholders, who are due to meet on April 9, to approve a dividend of 63 euro cents per share and authorize a share buyback for up to 467 million euros ($520 million).
The bank said it reserved the right to submit again to shareholders the same proposals after Oct. 1 depending on the ECB review of its recommendation.

The bank's core capital is set to rise by 0.37 percentage point following the decision not to distribute part of last year's profits as dividends, it said.

""Altice Europe commits, in these exceptional times, to pay no dividend to its shareholders,"" the group said in a statement.
In April last year, Amsterdam-listed Altice Europe had said in a regulatory filing it had not paid a dividend since the company was founded.
""With the exception of the special distribution in kind of its 67.2% interest in Altice USA Inc. to its shareholders out of its share premium reserve on June 8, 2018, Altice Europe N.V. has not paid any dividends since its incorporation,"" Altice Europe said in the filing.
Altice Europe's comments on dividends follows comments from unions officials that the company was planning to tap a French government support scheme for up to 60% of its workforce in the country.
Some unionized workers have criticized financially solidlisted companies for seeking to take advantage of state aid when there are smaller firms in greater need of support. Smaller rival  Bouygues  Telecom (PA:BOUY) reversed a decision to temporarily lay off 800 call center staff and client advisers, according to the CFDT union.
A Bouygues Telecom executive dismissed remarks by the CFDT union that the company done this after coming under union pressure.
He said Bouygues Telecom put those particular employees under temporary unemployment while it bought equipment that would allow them to work from home, and had acted in accordance with government orders.
Debt-ridden Altice Europe, founded and controlled by Patrick Drahi, beat quarterly earnings forecasts last week, showing how its turnaround plan was bearing fruit before the economic downturn caused by the coronavirus crisis.

299,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 29, 2020 03:30PM ET</span>",Coronavirus worries and strife: Investors fear markets not out of woods despite big rally,"By Megan Davies and April Joyner
NEW YORK (Reuters) - After a brutal meltdown, some investors have been wading back into U.S. stocks. But others are wary of another leg down as the coronavirus spreads and its economic impact is difficult to predict. 
High-profile investors from BlackRock Inc (N:BLK) to billionaire William Ackman have turned more bullish on equities in recent days, as unprecedented stimulus from the Federal Reserve, a $2.2 trillion stimulus bill signed Friday, and a call by President Donald Trump to get the United States back to work in weeks rather than months sparked the biggest weekly rally in the Dow Jones Industrial Average since 1938. 
But other investors, economists, and strategists are fearful of advising a jump back in, with no certainty about when the coronavirus outbreak will be under control. 
""People are trying to time the bottom and that's indicative of an early bear market, when people have hope,"" said Richard Bernstein, chief executive officer of Richard Bernstein Advisors. ""The beginning of a bull market starts with complete despair, when you've killed hope.""
Bernstein said he was a ""data hawk"" and was looking for a combination of ""improving fundamentals"" - eyeing the basic health of the asset, rather than trading patterns - and ""total disbelief,"" adding that in 2009 investors did not believe the bull market was real.
After a slump into bear market territory, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) surged over 20% from its recent low last week, which by one definition suggested a new bull market. That definition, however, should be treated with significant caution.
BofA said on Friday that its Bull & Bear Indicator - a key market measure used to track positioning - had hit ""maximum bearish,"" which could imply a rebound. However, that could have been borne out by the rally seen in the past week. 
Ackman, whose Pershing Square (NYSE:SQ) LP fund gained a net 6.8% this month according to one investor, wrote to investors last week to say he had taken off credit market hedges and invested the money in new and existing stock holdings after turning ""increasingly positive"" on stock and credit markets.
 Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) said there was merit in being an early mover rather than waiting until a market bottom ""has become apparent,"" while the BlackRock Investment Institute said the sell-off created value for long-term investors.
While some investors believe an earlier return to work would boost the U.S. economy, health experts say a haphazard patchwork of restrictions across states and a slow-to-mobilize White House could make the coronavirus impact worse. Cases in the United States soared past 135,000 on Sunday, the highest number in the world. [nL1N2BM046]
""Those advocating for less strict policy options have no real idea of the full social and economic costs of a large epidemic,"" said Steven Riley, professor of infectious disease dynamics at Imperial College London, Faculty of Medicine, School of Public Health, in an email to Reuters.
The possibility that the coronavirus outbreak fades, only to return once restrictions holding back economic activity are lifted, could cause ""a severe financial crisis,"" said business consultancy Fathom Consulting. 
Edward Moya, senior market analyst at currency trading firm OANDA in New York, said the ""longer we don't have people going to work, the greater the shock on the economy"" - which could mean ""U.S. markets open limit down at the start of next week."" Limit down refers to the restrictions placed on how fast markets can fall. 
U.S. stocks are expected to open down around 0.5%, according to financial spread betting company IG. 
""We can expect more drama this week given that Friday’s bounce was so rapidly sold after the official close, and with more U.S. jobs data to come, plus a further rise in infection rates and death tolls, it looks to be another choppy week,"" said Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, in a statement on Sunday.
BEAR MARKET BOUNCE 
Stocks have been highly volatile in the past few weeks, falling around 30% to notch a bear market then staging a stunning rally on hopes that the stimulus will help the economy.
Money managers rebalancing their portfolios to boost equity exposure into the end of the quarter may be supporting stocks.
A moderation in equity volatility could also help, as it is ""an important precondition for investors to raise equity exposures,"" said analysts at  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn). The Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) is down from its high earlier this month - although still pricing in some turbulence.
Still, on Friday, Wall Street stocks ended their massive three-day surge.
Shaun Osborne, chief FX strategist at Scotiabank, said in a research note on Thursday that there were a number of risks that could easily derail optimism, including how Western economies manage the virus and the re-emergence of cases in China. A more persistent slowdown that limits forward visibility on earnings further ""will curb the ability for stocks to rebound,"" he said. 
Retail investors are particularly bearish, with a survey showing them the most pessimistic about the stock market since spring 2009.
Action in haven assets such as gold also points to continued skepticism. George Gero, managing director at RBC Wealth Management, said he received calls from clients wanting to add to their gold holdings last week through exchange-traded funds. 

""Everywhere investors look, they see worry, problems and strife,"" Gero said.

LONDON (Reuters) - How much damage has the coronavirus and the oil price collapse inflicted on global financial markets this year? Put simply, it has probably been the most destructive sell-off since the Great Depression. 
The numbers have been staggering. $15 trillion has been wiped of world stock markets (MIWD00000PUS), oil has slumped 60% as Saudi Arabia and Russia have started a price war and emerging markets like Brazil, Mexico and South Africa have seen their currencies plummet more than 20%.
Volatility and corporate borrowing market stress has spiked on worries that whole sectors could go bust, airlines <.dMIWO0AL00PUS> have had half their value vaporized, while cratering economies risk a new wave of government debt crises.
""It has been like a train wreck,"" Chris Dyer, Director of Global Equity at  Eaton  (NYSE:ETN) Vance, said. ""You could see it coming and coming and coming, but you just couldn't stop it happening.""
That carnage has seen 22% and 24% slumps for Wall Street's Dow Jones (DJI) and S&P 500 (SPX), almost 25% for MSCI 49-country world index (MIWD00000PUS) and 27% for London's internationally exposed FTSE (FTSE).
For reference, the record quarterly drop for Wall Street was 40% in 1932 in the midst of the Great Depression. The fact that the S&P and Dow were at record highs back in mid February has made the crash this time seem more brutal.

Stocks in China, where the virus hit first, have faired relatively well in comparison with only an 11% drop in dollar terms (CSI300), but the impact on other major emerging markets has been devastating as their main commodity markets, and currencies, have also collapsed.
Russian stocks, which topped the tables last year, have been routed 40% in dollar terms. South Africa, which was stripped of its last investment grade credit rating on Friday, has fallen by the same percentage, though Brazil has been the worst, plunging 50%.
A large part of that is down to some wild FX market moves. All three of those countries have seen their currencies lose over 20% this year, which also ties in to the commodity market carnage.
Graphic: Currencies since the start of the year - https://reut.rs/2JjWrSm
Brent crude oil has fallen by 62% in the quarter to just $25 a barrel (LCOc1). This was not only because of the coronavirus crisis, but also the price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia, which is putting their public finances at risk.
Industrial metals like copper , aluminum  and steel have all dropped 15-22% and some agricultural staples like coffee  and sugar (SBc1) are down 17% and 10%.
""These are truly historical moments in the history of financial markets. 2020 will go alongside 1929, 1987 and 2008 in the text books of financial market panics,""  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) Strategist, Jim Reid, said.

GIVE ME SHELTER
So are they any places to shelter? Yes, but not many.
Sit-on-your-sofa-suited stocks like Netflix (O:NFLX) and Amazon (O:AMZN) have risen 10% and 2.5% respectively and some specialist medical equipment companies have surged. 
Ultra-safe U.S. government bonds have returned 13% as the Federal Reserve cut U.S. interest rates to effectively zero, leading a charge of around 62 interest rate cuts globally.
The dollar has rocketed against emerging market currencies. It had also shot up against the majors too, but has eased back over the last two weeks and will end the quarter only 2% up against those bigger currencies. 
This has left the Japanese yen, the other traditional FX safe-haven, with only a 0.4% gain . The Swiss franc is down against the dollar, although it has climbed steeply against the euro and many other currencies. (EURCHF=)
Will April bring much relief? JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) reckons the coronavirus will have pushed the world economy into a 12% contraction in Q1 and with pandemic still spreading rapidly and keeping large parts of the global economy shuttered it is unlikely to get much easier in Q2.
The cavalry has arrived though. G20 governments have promised a $5 trillion revival effort, major central banks have cut rates and restarted asset purchases. Markets bounced big last week until Friday came and may still end Q1 on a relative high. 
Stephane Monier, Chief Investment Officer of Lombard Odier, is looking to see whether infection rates in Europe and elsewhere peak as they did in Asia. If they do, markets could see a V-shaped 30% recovery, although if they do not and cases jump in Asia again as lockdowns are lifted, it could be akin to a ""war"" situation which would impact the economy for 1-1/2 years. 
""Our expectation is for a very volatile second quarter,"" Monier said. ""It is important to keep in liquid, high-quality assets.""

303,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 29, 2020 07:05AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Qatar Airways says it will need state support as cash runs out,"By Alexander Cornwell
DUBAI (Reuters) - Qatar Airways will have to seek government support eventually, Chief Executive Akbar al-Baker told Reuters on Sunday, warning that the Middle East carrier could soon run out of the cash needed to continue flying. 
Several states have stepped in to help airlines hammered by the coronavirus pandemic that has virtually halted international travel, with the United States offering $58 billion in aid. 
Qatar Airways is one of few airlines continuing to maintain scheduled commercial passenger services and over the next two weeks expects to operate 1,800 flights.
""We have received many requests from governments all over the world, embassies in certain countries, requesting Qatar Airways not to stop flying,"" Baker said by phone from Doha.
The state-owned carrier is operating flights to Europe, Asia and Australia, repatriating people who have been left stranded after many countries shut their borders.
""We will fly as long as it is necessary and we have requests to get stranded people to their homes, provided the airspace is open and the airports are open,"" Baker said.
However, he warned that the airline was burning through cash and only had enough to sustain operations for a ""very short period"".
""We will surely go to our government eventually,"" Baker added.
He declined to say when the airline would need state aid, which could come in the form of loans or equity, but said it was taking measures to conserve cash.
Employees have taken paid and unpaid leave voluntarily and Baker said he had forfeited his salary until the airline returns to full operations. Staff would not be forced to take pay cuts, though Baker said some had offered to do so.
The airline had said before the pandemic it would report a loss this financial year because of a regional political dispute that forces it to fly longer, more expensive routes to avoid airspace that it had been banned from using by some of neighboring countries.
Rivals Emirates and Etihad Airways, of the United Arab Emirates, have grounded passenger operations, which Baker said had not benefited his airline.
Qatar Airways has been operating some flights at 50% occupancy or less and if it fills 45% of seats on flights over the next two weeks it will carry about 250,000 passengers. 

“We are not taking advantage … this is a time to serve people who want to be with their loved ones in a very trying time,"" Baker said.

305,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 29, 2020 01:10AM ET</span>",Oil-rich wealth funds seen shedding upto $225 billion in stocks,"By Tom Arnold
LONDON (Reuters) - Sovereign wealth funds from oil-producing countries mainly in the Middle East and Africa are on course to dump up to $225 billion in equities, a senior banker estimates, as plummeting oil prices and the coronavirus pandemic hit state finances.
The rapid spread of the virus has ravaged the global economy, sending markets into a tailspin and costing both oil and non-oil based sovereign wealth funds around $1 trillion in equity losses, according to JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) strategist Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou.
His estimates are based on data from sovereign wealth funds and figures from the Sovereign Wealth Fund Institute, a research group.
Sticking with equity investments and risking more losses is not an option for some funds from oil producing nations. Their governments are facing a financial double-whammy – falling revenues due to the spiraling oil price and rocketing spending as administrations rush out emergency budgets.
Around $100-$150 billion in stocks have likely been offloaded by oil-producer sovereign wealth funds, excluding Norway's fund, in recent weeks, Panigirtzoglou said, and a further $50-$75 billion will likely be sold in the coming months.
""It makes sense for sovereign funds to frontload their selling, as you don't want to be selling your assets at a later stage when it is more likely to have distressed valuations,"" he said.
Most oil-based funds are required to keep substantial cash-buffers in place in case a collapse in oil prices triggers a request from the government for funding.
A source at an oil-based sovereign fund said it had been gradually raising its liquidity position since oil prices began drifting lower from their most recent peak above $70 a barrel in October 2018. 
In addition to the cash reserves, additional liquidity was typically drawn firstly from short-term money market instruments like treasury bills and then from passively invested equity as a last resort, the source said.
It's generally a similar trend for other funds.
""Our investor flows broadly show more resilience than market pricing would suggest,"" said Elliot Hentov, head of policy research at  State Street  (NYSE:STT) Global Advisors. ""There has been a shift toward cash since the crisis started, but it's not a panic move but rather gradual.""
The sovereign fund source said the fund had made adjustments to its actively-managed equity investments due to the market rout, both to stem losses and position for the recovery, when it comes.
Exactly how much sovereign wealth funds invest and with whom remain undisclosed. Many don't even report the value of the assets they manage. 
On Thursday, the Norwegian sovereign wealth fund said it had lost $124 billion so far this year as equity markets sunk but its outgoing CEO Yngve Slyngstad said it would, at some point, start buying stocks to get its portfolio back to its target equity allocation of 70% from 65% currently.
Slyngstad also said that any fiscal spending by the government this year would be financed by selling bonds in its portfolio. 
DEFENDING THE CURRENCY
State-backed, energy-rich funds account for a significant chunk of the roughly $8.40 trillion in total sovereign wealth assets, funds they've built up as a bulwark for when oil revenues dry up.
Sovereign funds have become major players on global stock markets, accounting for roughly 5-10% of total holdings, and an important source of income for Wall Street asset managers.
While they have been hit hard by the approximate 20% slide in global equity prices, the oil-based funds' governments in Abu Dhabi, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Nigeria and Angola have also seen their finances strained by a nearly two thirds drop in oil prices this year.
Gulf sovereign wealth funds could see their assets decline by $296 billion by the end of this year, according to Garbis Iradian, chief Middle East and North Africa economist at the Institute of International Finance (IIF).
Around $216 billion of that fall would be from stock market losses and a further $80 billion from drawdowns taken by cash-squeezed governments.
The central banks of Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar have offered a total $60 billion in stimulus, although expectations of tighter liquidity have already pressured Gulf currencies, pegged for decades to the U.S. dollar.
""There's a question of whether some of these funds are going to be used to support currencies, as some legal frameworks allow this,"" said Danae Kyriakopoulou, chief economist of the Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum (OMFIF), a think tank.
""In the previous 10 years some countries moved reserves from their central banks to sovereign funds, allowing them to invest in more risky assets as they have greater flexibility.""
""Now, that may be a problem, because you have more reserves in the sovereign fund than the central bank when you may need the reserves to defend the currency.""
Saudi Arabia is among countries that have in recent years moved reserves from its central bank to beef up its sovereign investment vehicle, Public Investment Fund, which holds stakes in Uber (NYSE:UBER) and electric car firm Lucid Motors, and had around $300 billion in assets under management in 2019.
In 2015, the last time crude prices collapsed, Saudi Arabia's central bank, which then oversaw a larger chunk of the kingdom's investments, mainly in securities such as U.S. Treasury bonds, ran down its foreign assets by over $100 billion to cover a huge state budget deficit. 

This month, Saudi Arabia's Finance Minister Mohammed al-Jadaan said the country would look to borrow to finance its deficit after announcing an economic support package worth more than $32 billion.

Pershing Square earned roughly $2.6 billion by hedging its stock portfolio in early March through credit protection on investment grade and high yield credit indices. Much of the money has been reinvested in stocks the firm already owns.
""Today, we are unhedged, and we no longer own any insurance"", Ackman said in a Twitter thread https:// adding that he continues to believe the sooner the entire United States is shut down, the more lives will be saved and the sooner the economy will recover.

308,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 28, 2020 11:40AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Amazon entices warehouse employees to grocery unit with higher pay,"By Krystal Hu
(Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is offering higher pay to recruit its own warehouse employees to pick and pack Whole Foods groceries amid rising demand and a worker shortage, according to an internal document reviewed by Reuters. 
This move, known as labor sharing, highlights how the ecommerce giant is reallocating some of its vast workforce to handle a spike in online sales of groceries, as millions of American are stuck at home amid the COVID-19 outbreak. 
Amazon offers online grocery services through Amazon Fresh from its own grocery warehouses, and Amazon Prime Now, which delivers from its Whole Foods stores. 
""The Prime Now business has seen a mass increase in volume and is now offering labor share opportunities,"" Amazon said in a message sent to warehouse workers in Maryland, which was reviewed by Reuters. Workers in other states where Amazon operates grocery services have received similar communications, including California, Nevada, and Tennessee.
Employees who are selected to make the switch can make $19 per hour, a $2 raise on top of the pay hike Amazon announced earlier this month. Amazon Fresh positions require working in a freezer environment, while a Prime Now shopper role entails picking and packing products for online orders in a Whole Foods store under tight time limits.
""As we continue to see a significant increase in demand for grocery orders, we are offering temporary opportunities for associates across our fulfillment network to provide additional support,"" an Amazon spokesperson said on late Friday, confirming the action.
Amazon has been doubling down on the grocery industry since its $13.7 billion acquisition of Whole Foods in 2017. It has expanded grocery delivery service to over 2,000 cities. Free for Prime subscribers, AmazonFresh and Amazon Prime Now tout quick delivery within hours.
Since the outbreak, grocery delivery has become a lifeline for people to get household staples while trying to avoid stepping outside. Grocery shoppers on Amazon have frequently seen items out of stock and delivery windows unavailable as the company struggles to meet the rising demand. It has announced the hiring of 100,000 full and part-time positions across the U.S. in fulfillment and delivery networks, including in AmazonFresh and Whole Foods delivery.
So far, coronavirus has spread to at least 17 Amazon warehouses in the U.S., prompting workers and lawmakers to question if enough safety measures have been taken to protect employees on the frontlines. 
Grocery stores are competing for workers to fulfill online orders. Walmart (NYSE:WMT), with a fast growing online grocery business, plans to hire 150,000 employees at stores, distribution and fulfillment centers through May.

""We're seeing a dramatic increase in the use of online grocery shopping,"" said Bill Bishop, co-founder of Brick Meets Click. ""Amazon eventually wants to be one of the very dominant distributors of grocery in the United States, and I think they're looking at this as a period when they've got a chance to ramp that up by actions like this.""

OneWeb is in negotiations for debtor-in-possession financing, which if acquired and approved by the court will support its ongoing business, the company said in a statement that did not mention how many jobs were being cut.
The company also said it had been in talks for funding since the beginning of the year but the process had stalled due to the financial impact of the coronavirus outbreak.

Royal Bank of Canada, Toronto-Dominion Bank, Bank of Nova Scotia , Bank of Montreal and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce all cut their prime rates to 2.45%, effective March 30.
The Bank of Canada cut its overnight interest rate by 50 basis points to 0.25%, its lowest level since June 2010 and the third cut in March. 
Separately, Canada's financial regulator eased its capital and liquidity requirements for banks, changed credit loss provisioning and allowed more loans to be securitized.
The pandemic has forced several governments to take actions as businesses grind to a halt and several retailers close stores to curb the spread of the highly-contagious diseases, leaving many people jobless.
To date, Canada has reported 4,689 coronavirus cases and 53 deaths.

The U.S. Federal Reserve has also cut interest rates twice in less than two weeks in March, emergency moves to help shore up the economy in the face of the damage caused by the virus.

311,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 27, 2020 09:30PM ET</span>","Apple's factories are running, but suppliers wary about iPhone demand","By Yimou Lee, Heekyong Yang and Krishna N. Das
(Reuters) - As China reopens its economy after months of lockdown, Apple Inc's (O:AAPL) iPhone factories are largely up and running. But with the coronavirus pandemic spreading across the world, the urgent question for the company is how many buyers there will be both for current models and the new slate of phones expected in the fall.
A senior official at one of Apple's major contract assemblers said Apple's orders for the quarter ending in March are likely to drop 18% compared with the previous year. The production ramp-up for new phones that work with next-generation 5G networks has been postponed, this person said, though it is still possible the 5G phones could launch as scheduled in the fall.
""No one is talking about manpower or material shortage (in China) anymore. Now everyone is looking at whether demand from U.S. and Europe could keep up,"" said the person, who has direct knowledge of the matter. ""The focus now is the demand from consumers in the U.S. and Europe.""
One of Apple's key display suppliers is preparing for a similar level of contraction, according to a person familiar the matter. The company had anticipated shipping 70 million iPhone displays this year, but is now considering lowering that target by more than 17% to 58 million units.
The company is also planning to reduce the workforce at its Apple-designated production lines in its Vietnam factory, where displays are assembled before heading to China to be put into phones, this person said.
Apple declined to comment for this story.
Earlier this month, the company closed retail stores around the world even as it began to reopen outlets in China. With much of Europe and the United States on lockdown and unemployment soaring globally, there is little clarity on when demand might return.
The company could also yet face further supply chain problems as countries including Malaysia and Vietnam impose new restrictions to combat the coronavirus.
""Things are changing on a day by day basis due to supply chain disruptions, so it is difficult to craft any meaningful comment at the moment about both supply and demand,"" said an official at one supplier in Malaysia. 
FOGGY DEMAND OUTLOOK 
In February, Apple retracted its sales forecast for the quarter ended in March without giving a new one. Shares have dropped more than 15% since the start of the year.
""Our base case scenario assumes a shock to June quarter demand with steadily improving results"" in the second half of the year rather than a ""V-shaped"" recovery, Canaccord Genuity analyst Michael Walkley wrote in a note to investors on March 18.
Taipei-based technology analyst Arthur Liao of Fubon Research cut iPhone shipment forecasts for this year's first quarter to 35 million units, down 17% from 41 million units a year ago. The firm lowered total iPhone shipment forecasts for 2020 to 198 million, down from an earlier forecast of 204 million. 
In the United States, at least, consumers themselves seem uncertain whether they will resume spending. In a survey of more than 2,600 U.S. adults by Civis Analytics conducted March 18-20, more than half of respondents said they planned to spend about the same on consumer electronics as before the virus outbreak if the situation is contained in the coming weeks. 
But if the situation worsens, the respondents were evenly split, with roughly one-third each saying they would spend less, the same or more on consumer electronics when conditions returned to normal.
Such ambiguity has made it hard for Apple suppliers to gauge how 2020 will play out. 
One maker of a sensor for the iPhone said the company continues to produce and ship parts for Apple devices and that this year's first quarter ending in March was better than last year, with the second quarter also likely be higher volume than the year before.
""We were given a forecast for this quarter before the pandemic, about a month ago,"" a person familiar with the situation at the sensor supplier said last week. ""And now we are still producing as per the forecast given to us.""

(Corrects paragraph 10 to show that Apple retracted its guidance in February, not January)

312,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 27, 2020 08:15PM ET</span>","Trump tells GM: Stop 'wasting time', build ventilators to address coronavirus","By David Shepardson and Ben Klayman
WASHINGTON/DETROIT (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday invoked emergency powers to require General Motors Co (N:GM) to build much-needed ventilators for coronavirus patients after he accused the largest U.S. automaker of ""wasting time"" during negotiations.
Trump, who has been on the defensive for not moving faster to compel the production of medical equipment, for the first time invoked the Defense Production Act, saying GM was not moving quickly enough even though earlier on Friday the largest U.S. automaker announced it would begin building ventilators in the coming weeks.
Asked about negotiations with GM over ventilators, Trump expressed anger with the company's decision to close an assembly plant in politically important Ohio. He also criticized GM's prior decisions to build plants outside the United States.
""I didn't go into it with a favorable view,"" Trump told a news conference of the GM talks. White House adviser Peter Navarro said the administration ran into ""roadblocks"" with GM this week. 
GM said in a statement in response to Trump that it has been working with ventilator firm Ventec Life Systems and GM suppliers ""around the clock for over a week to meet this urgent need"" and said its commitment to Ventec's ventilators ""has never wavered."" 
The act grants the president power to expand industrial production of any key materials or products for national security and other reasons. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo and other Democrats have urged him to invoke the act, but the president had been reluctant to do so until now.
Democratic U.S. Senator Ed Markey said, ""About time. Now, tell us every day: which companies will be making more of this equipment, how much is being made, and where the equipment is going.""
On Friday, the number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the United States topped 100,000, the highest in the world according to a Reuters tally. The U.S. death toll topped 1,550. [L1N2BK21G]
Trump also said countries such as the United Kingdom, Germany, Spain and Italy need ventilators and that if the excess volume is not needed, the United States can export them.
Earlier, Trump lashed out at GM and  Ford Motor Co  (M:F) for moving too slowly just hours before GM said it would build medical equipment at an Indiana plant.
Trump criticized the U.S. automakers and said he expected the United States would make or obtain 100,000 additional ventilators within the next 100 days.
The attack on the automakers coincided with rising tension between Trump and the Democratic governors of New York and Michigan, who have criticized the administration's response to the COVID-19 epidemic. On Thursday evening, Trump questioned in an interview on the Fox News network whether New York state needed 30,000 ventilators to cope with rising numbers of coronavirus patients, as Cuomo had said.
GM and Ford separately announced earlier this week they were working with medical equipment companies to help boost ventilator production.
GM and its partner Ventec confirmed after Trump's tweets that the No. 1 U.S. automaker would deploy 1,000 workers to build ventilators at its Kokomo, Indiana, parts plant and ship as soon as next month. It was aiming to build more than 10,000 per month with the ability to go higher. Suppliers in the effort were told the target was 200,000 ventilators. 
But early Friday, before GM issued its release, Trump attacked the automaker and Chief Executive Mary Barra on Twitter, reviving his grievance with Barra for closing and selling a car factory in Ohio, a state critical to the president's re-election campaign. 
""General Motors MUST immediately open their stupidly abandoned Lordstown plant in Ohio, or some other plant, and START MAKING VENTILATORS, NOW!!!!!! FORD, GET GOING ON VENTILATORS, FAST!!!!!!"" Trump wrote on Twitter on Friday. 
""They said they were going to give us 40,000 much needed ventilators, 'very quickly',"" Trump said on Twitter of GM and Ventec's effort. ""Now they are saying it will only be 6000, in late April, and they want top dollar.""
Trump's comments about GM and Ford came after a New York Times story Thursday suggested the White House had backed away from announcing a major ventilator deal with GM and Ventec because the price tag was too high. That drew criticism from Democrats. 
Following Trump's tweets, Ford said it was moving as fast as it could to gear up its ventilator manufacturing efforts and was in ""active conversations"" with the Trump administration seeking approvals. Ford said it has ""teams working flat-out with GE Healthcare (N:GE) to boost production of simplified ventilators."" 
Other automakers have said they are working to produce ventilators, masks and other medical equipment. 
On Friday, Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203) said it was ""finalizing agreements to begin working with at least two companies that produce ventilators and respirators to help increase their capacity.""
New York City Mayor Bill be Blasio on Friday said on Twitter that Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) had agreed to donate hundreds of ventilators to hospital intensive care units in New York City and the state of New York.
    Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk in response said the electric carmaker was helping locate and deliver existing ventilators. 
    Tesla on Friday did not respond to a request for comment on where it got the ventilators and whether the company was producing any ventilators of its own, something Musk has said the company will do.

Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCA) and  Ferrari  (MI:RACE) previously said they were exploring making ventilators in Italy.

313,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 27, 2020 07:50PM ET</span>",Fed action pushes top-rated U.S. corporate bond issuance to record,"By Joshua Franklin
NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. companies raised a record $109.1 billion through investment-grade bond sales this week, as corporate America hoarded cash following measures unveiled on Monday by the Federal Reserve to backstop the market for high-quality debt. 
 Nike  Inc (N:NKE), McDonald's Corp (N:MCD) and  Home Depot  Inc (N:HD) were among 49 companies that borrowed money through investment-grade bonds this week, according to IFR Refinitiv data. They beat the previous weekly record of $73.5 billion in new issues that was set in September 2019.
""It is a desire on the part of companies to build liquidity in an uncertain time. You combine that with the fact that markets have been so volatile, when they open up companies want to take advantage,"" said Andrew Karp, head of global investment grade capital markets at Bank Of America Securities, which worked on many of this week's deals. 
The bond issuance frenzy came after the U.S. Federal Reserve on Monday rolled out an unprecedented series of measures to support an economy reeling from sweeping restrictions on commerce to slow the coronavirus pandemic.
The actions included a plan for the Federal Reserve to act as a buyer of last resort in the investment-grade bond market. A stimulus bill that passed into law on Friday would allow the U.S. Treasury to backstop trillion of dollars worth of lending to businesses using the Federal Reserve's balance sheet.
""The Federal Reserve action was a big deal. That sent a very powerful message to investors that the Federal Reserve is there to make sure that the market is functioning properly at a minimum. It gave a lot of investors confidence to come back into the market,"" said Karp.
Still, the record bond issuance came at a cost. The investment-grade bond index soared to a roughly 350 basis point spread over U.S. Treasuries, compared to a low of 100 basis points, as borrowing cost even for the most credit-worthy companies soared, according to Karp. 

While the investment-grade bond market is booming, there has been no new issuance of junk-rated bonds by U.S. companies since March 4, the longest lull since the 2008 financial crisis. This is because risk-averse investors are seeking to park their money with high-quality credit assets amid the market turmoil.

315,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 27, 2020 06:42PM ET</span>",Three Things Under the Radar This Week,"By Yasin Ebrahim and Kim Khan 
Investing.com - The Covid-19 pandemic is pushing and pulling the markets into all kinds of uncharted territory.
Even those just looking at the major equity indexes would have a tough time looking away from the screens this week, where big moves on small amounts of information were common.
While bulls cheered this week’s action, there were already questions about whether the bears could really be gone. The consumer was predictably downbeat, but how did that compare historically? And is even looking at current economic data an antiquated idea?
Here are three things that flew under the radar this week.
1. Wall Street Debates Bottom as Wild Swings Continue
The wild ride on Wall Street continued this week as the Dow's slump on Friday, did little to take the shine off its best week since 1938. The milestone arrived after a three-day rally through Thursday saw the index end its three-week bear market, its shortest on record, stoking hopes that the bottom may be in.
But some on Wall Street remain wary of calling a bottom.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) identified two conditions that need to be met before any talk of market bottom can be taken seriously: The pace of Covid-19 infections will have to flatten in the U.S. and Europe and visibility will needed on how long the two respective economies will take to recover.
But there is little hope the pace of infection is nearing the end game. The U.S. has seen surge in infections this week, surpassing that of Italy and China.
Meanwhile, several companies in the U.S. and Europe have recently pulled their guidance, underscoring the lack of visibility on the impact of the virus.
The wave of stimulus rolled out by the federal government and the Federal Reserve, however, has some convinced the market has bottomed.
""I found the rally off the bottom in the few couple days impressive. I think it’s gone as far as it should go,"" billionaire investor Lee Cooperman told CNBC. ""The market is in the zone of fair valuation. Until we get more of a handle on the virus, I would think that one should be very defensive.""
2. No Silver Bullet for Sentiment
The University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment index’s final March reading was the biggest drop since the Great Recession in 2008, down 11.9.
But a more comparable decline was likely the 11.8-point drop after the invasion of Kuwait in August 1990, the survey publishers said.
In that case, sentiment had turned around by March 1991, when the reading posted an all-time gain of 17.3 points. The two readings bookended the 1990-1991 U.S. recession.
The index can be expected to decline further in the months ahead, like in 1990, but any sort of bounce-back is uncertain.
“The extent of additional declines in April will depend on the success in curtailing the spread of the virus and how quickly households receive funds to relieve their financial hardships,” the university said. “Mitigating the negative impacts on health and finances may curb rising pessimism, but it will not produce optimism.”
“There is no silver bullet that could end the pandemic as suddenly as the military victory that ended the Gulf war.”
3. A Fog Rolls in Over the Data
When it comes to economic data, there is also the possibility that we’re in a new landscape where the old rules don’t apply, and we don’t even know it.
The March U.S. employment report is coming Friday, April 3. Normally this would be a must-see event. But maybe investors would be better served spending the time on something else.
University of Michigan Economics Professor Justin Wolfers speculated on a Twitter thread Thursday that the numbers aren’t going to be reliable for a while.
The jobs report will be on “data on unemployment and payrolls from the 2nd week of March which is before the coronavirus shutdown,” Wolfers tweeted. “So we need to wait six weeks, until May 8, when we'll get numbers on the April labor market.”
GDP won’t capture the major effects until the Q2 release, which is July 30, and managers can reply any time for ISM March numbers, so that won’t be a true picture, he added.
Relying on initial claims? The unemployment insurance landscape will completely change with the fiscal stimulus package, he said.
“Point is, social isolation has so completely changed economic life that the historical relationship of any individual indicator with the state of the economy has likely shifted, perhaps dramatically,” Wolfers said.
“Bottom line: We're sailing into an economic data fog.”

316,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 27, 2020 06:25PM ET</span>",U.S. airlines cheer government relief but warn it is no 'cure' for deep industry crisis,"By Tracy Rucinski
CHICAGO (Reuters) - United Airlines Holdings Inc and Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) welcomed on Friday a $50 billion relief package they said would protect jobs through September but warned that the continued challenges facing the industry will require more action.
Airlines are weathering their largest ever downturn as the coronavirus has ground global travel to a halt. A massive government stimulus package passed on Friday gives airlines some breathing room in terms of managing costs, but they still face tough decisions in the months ahead. 
""If the recovery is as slow as we fear, it means our airline and our workforce will have to be smaller than it is today,"" United said in a memo to employees. 
Based on projections for the spread of the coronavirus and the global economy's reaction, Chief Executive Oscar Munoz and President Scott Kirby said they expect ""demand to remain suppressed for months after that, possibly into next year.""
Delta CEO Ed Bastian told employees that the relief package was not ""a cure"" and urged workers to continue signing up for voluntary unpaid leaves of absence.
U.S. airlines are set to receive $25 billion in grants to cover payrolls over the next six months, but are still encouraging workweek reductions, unpaid leaves and early retirements to further cut costs as they face more cancellations than bookings.
Before the global crisis, U.S. airlines were transporting a record 2.5 million passengers a day. Now planes are only 10% to 20% full and new bookings are showing 80% to 90% declines in traffic even after dramatic cuts in capacity, industry lobby Airlines for America said.
Airlines say the situation is dramatically different from just four weeks ago and getting worse each day with no end in sight. All are planning continued capacity reductions into the summer.
Unions representing pilots and flight attendants also welcomed the bill but said challenges remain in implementing it.
EQUITY STAKES
In exchange for the $25 billion in direct grants, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin can demand equity, warrants or other financial instruments, a prospect that caused some frustration for airlines as the deal was reaching the finish line this week, people familiar with the matter said.
Airlines expect to learn the terms of the aid in the next five to 10 days, senior United executives said, and trust they will not be so onerous that airlines would not apply. 
The industry directly supports 750,000 jobs and has argued that it must have the financial ability to jump-start operations once demand starts to return. 
The leaders of American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) Group Inc, which has the largest workforce of any U.S. carrier, said late Thursday that they had not decided to apply for federal funds, noting that the terms were still unclear.

Still, Mnuchin insisted on Friday that taxpayers would be compensated. ""I've been very clear this is not an airline bailout,"" he told Fox Business Network.

318,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 27, 2020 04:10PM ET</span>",Cash handouts and bond buying: $10 trillion-plus deployed against virus,"By Ritvik Carvalho and Tommy Wilkes
LONDON (Reuters) - More than 300 basis points in combined interest rate cuts, a tenth of annual output in central bank stimulus and $5 trillion of new government spending and credit guarantees - authorities in the world's biggest economies are showering cash like never before to limit the damage from the coronavirus pandemic.
With infection rates surging in Europe and the United States, the global economy is tipped for recession in 2020, and many countries are expected to suffer the deepest downturn in decades as business, trade and travel shutdowns bite.
Policymakers have responded by opening the taps. Central banks are injecting nearly $6 trillion, while leaders of the Group of 20 major economies have pledged to inject more than $5 trillion.
Combined, these totals are far in excess of what was delivered after the 2008 global financial crisis.
""Global policy liquidity response has now superseded that of (2008 crisis),"" Pictet Asset Management's senior macro strategist Steve Donzé said, referring to monetary stimulus alone. 
""This shock has brought forward the paradigm shift from central banks as the only game in town to monetary-fiscal coordination.""
The U.S. Federal Reserve's money-printing expansion already amounts to all purchases done under its quantitative easing programs over 2008-14, according to Donzé.
Central banks and governments are also guaranteeing swathes of company debts and embracing policies that were very recently regarded as radical, such as providing cash directly to citizens or paying the wages of those at risk of unemployment.
Below are three charts detailing the scale of the monetary and fiscal firepower unleashed:
MONETARY BAZOOKA
The world's five biggest central banks - the Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank, the People's Bank of China, and the Bank of Japan and Bank of England - are delivering stimulus worth $5.7 trillion this year, or 9.7% of gross domestic product.
That compares with 6.5% of GDP following the 2008-2009 financial crisis.

CUTTING TO ZERO 
The G10 economies have slashed interest rates by more than 300 basis points combined since March 3, the day the Fed implemented an emergency rate cut. Rates have hit record lows in most countries. Globally, more than 3,000 basis points worth of rate cuts have been delivered, analysis by Reuters shows.

FISCAL TO THE RESCUE
The budget firepower unleashed by the biggest economies has been eye-popping; even Germany with its dedication to balanced budgets could need to borrow an additional 350 billion euros or so ($388 billion) this year to fund a huge new stimulus plan. 
Leaders of the G20 group of countries said on Thursday they would inject more than $5 trillion, but this figure includes credit guarantees for businesses that are not actual new spending.
According to Reuters calculations, the G10 economies plus China are expected to spend an extra $3 trillion in various forms - from payouts to citizens to tax breaks.
Other big nations such as India and Brazil are also adding tens of billions of dollars in expenditure. 
The size of the global fiscal splurge is expected to rise sharply as more countries, including Japan, ramp up spending.

Investing.com - Wall Street plunged amid late selling Friday, even as the United States' economic battle against the Covid-19 pandemic received a major boost on the House of Representatives passing the $2 trillion economic rescue package.
The Dow fell 4.06%, or 915.39 points. The S&P 500 lost 3.37% and the Nasdaq Composite fell 3.79%.
President Donald Trump signed the $2 trillion stimulus package just after market close. It's the largest aid package in U.S. history and one that many hope will go a long way to ensuring the economy bounces back quickly from a widely-expected recession.
The key measures of the bill include fiscal support to small as well as large businesses, and checks to ordinary Americans at time when the U.S. infections of Covid-19 have topped 90,000, above China's 81,000 and Italy's nearly 87,000.
The aviation sector, which is in desperate need of help, remained under pressure, with United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) and American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) falling sharply on concerns the government support included in the stimulus bill will not offset a prolonged slump in travel demand.
Energy and technology stocks were among the biggest declines amid late-day selling as investors remain wary of holding onto bullish bets over the weekend amid the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic.

The drama began when California Governor Gavin Newsom called out the bank for not offering 90-day grace periods to mortgage borrowers affected by the coronavirus, despite such pledges by rivals including JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co. and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co. A journalist tweeted the lashing, and then Corden reposted it to his 10.7 million followers. The bank raced to correct what it called the governor’s mistake.
Just over an hour later, the firm promised Corden it would defer payments on home loans for as long as the crisis requires. He relented, putting the internet’s fury to rest:
Across the nation, bankers are on edge. Publicly, they’re emphasizing that unlike the last downturn in 2008 they aren’t the cause of this collapse and they intend to help America get through it. Privately, they worry they’re destined to get cast as villains.
Once the government enacts its $2 trillion rescue package, banks are going to be the last resort for millions of consumers and businesses needing additional support to weather months of hardship. The nation’s eight banking titans have enough excess capital to ramp up lending by $1.6 trillion, but even that probably isn’t enough to meet everyone’s needs.
That means bankers will often decide which borrowers get relief from existing loans or access to more credit -- make-or-break moments for people and businesses trying to avoid default and insolvency.
One of the industry’s most senior leaders put it this way: The country’s banks are strong and ready to support the economy -- but they can’t afford to lend irresponsibly to clients who can’t repay. That limits the ability of banks to lend to others.
“The best credits are made in the worst of times,” said Julie Solar, a senior analyst who tracks North American financial institutions at Fitch Ratings. As the virus’s toll on the economy worsens, lenders will eventually be forced to pick winners and losers, she said. “Those borrowers who are higher investment grade are going to fare better.”
‘Fine Line’
There are also ethical questions: Banks must walk a “fine line” to prevent desperate clients from overburdening themselves with debts they can’t repay,  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C). Chief Executive Officer Michael Corbat told the Financial Times this week. That’s “the last thing that we all want to see.”
Bank of America’s quick move to head off a Twitter backlash shows how worried banks are about keeping public criticism at bay. The lender followed up with a statement saying Newsom was mistaken and that it plans to defer payments on a monthly basis until the end of the crisis.
Banks have many other lending decisions ahead. It’s not hard to imagine people and employers facing rejection will feel they could’ve made it through if their bankers just gave them a chance. Such accusations have deep roots in American history, notably the Great Depression.
Desperation is rapidly mounting.
Companies hit first by the sudden halt to global travel -- such as airlines, hotels, cruise-ship operators, casinos and oil producers -- have been drawing down billions of dollars from existing credit lines for weeks. Their pain soon spread to restaurants, retailers and legions of small businesses as a growing number mayors and governors told residents to stay home.
On Thursday, the U.S. reported an unprecedented surge in the number of people seeking jobless benefits, with 3.28 million filing claims in just one week.
Behind the scenes, senior bankers said they are rapidly reevaluating their loan portfolios to gauge how the virus and social distancing measures are likely to affect corporate customers, trying to figure out which are most or least resilient.
Banks have been honoring credit lines they offered corporate clients in the halcyon years before the pandemic. One looming question is whether lenders might invoke the so-called MAC, or “materially adverse change” clauses, to stop drawdowns. One concern is that some businesses with little to no chance of making it through will siphon off billions in loans that could go toward supporting others.
Citing those clauses risks sending shock waves across the industry, potentially prompting stronger companies to draw down their lines preemptively. Still, one high-level banker said he’s expecting to see a few denials this year.
Banks are trying to maintain goodwill in Washington, working in close coordination with regulators on measures to shore up the financial system. Earlier this month, a delegation of CEOs from firms including  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS)., Wells Fargo, Citigroup and Bank of America visited the White House to offer reassurances that they can weather the turmoil and help others.
In the days since, national and regional lenders have rolled out a series of good deeds. They pledged more than $200 million to charities and relief efforts. Some offered branch workers extra pay. Several suspended long-planned layoffs to give workers certainty.
While the stimulus bill passed by the Senate this week includes clauses offering some borrowers forbearance, consumer advocates have been urging banks to go further on their own.
Lawmakers are ratcheting up pressure on lenders to help constituents in other ways. Last week, Senators Elizabeth Warren and Ed Markey pushed banks and credit unions in their home state of Massachusetts to suspend a variety of fees -- such as charges for late payments, overdrafts and using ATMS -- that generate billions of dollars in annual revenue nationally.
To conserve funds for lending, the country’s largest banks vowed to stop buying back their own shares through at least the middle of the year. The move comes at a cost for investors, some of whom would have preferred firms snap up shares at depressed prices, blunting this year’s 40% plunge in the KBW Bank Index.
“The biggest difference between now and 2008 is that the banks are a source of strength rather than the source of the problem,” said Tom Naratil, co-head of UBS Group AG’s wealth management unit. “This is the time for banks, obviously prudently, to make sure that we are extending credit to our clients.”

322,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 27, 2020 03:35PM ET</span>",Hedge fund Fir Tree puts $410 million dislocation fund to work,"By Svea Herbst-Bayliss
BOSTON (Reuters) - After years of waiting and watching from afar, hedge fund Fir Tree Partners is spending $410 million from its dislocation funds on stocks, pockets of the credit market and other securities, sure the historic market sell-off made new bargains.
The $3 billion hedge fund, known for winning bets on the overheated housing market and making money in credit crises, has put roughly 30% to work and is scouring all sectors for opportunities as markets seesaw, a person familiar with the firm's trading told Reuters.
Fears about the corona virus sparked panic selling and fears about growth are weighing on them still even as a government stimulus packaged prompted buying.
Fir Tree, which has been managing money since 1994, began raising money for its Capital Opportunity Dislocation Fund and Value Dislocation Fund in 2013 and 2014, years before other investment firms created vehicles designed to eventually profit from an economic downturn or market drop.
Its pool is different. It has a broader investment mandate that permits buying in virtually all sectors, including capital structure arbitrage, special situations and real estate. There are also fixed investment triggers that strip out human emotion on calling when it is time to buy.
Firms including Sixth Street Partners and Centerbridge Partners LP are now unleashing capital in portfolios earmarked for a crisis. These funds are likely to profit in a year other investments are nursing heavy losses. The average stock-focused hedge fund has lost 16% this year through the middle of March, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) data show, and the S&P 500 Index has lost 21% since January.
Fir Tree's mandate lets managers buy only after a 12% decline in the S&P 500 Total Return Index or a 250 basis point spread widening in the JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Global High Yield Index. In late 2018 when stocks dropped, the signals said it was time; the commitment period had ended and a two year clock to put the money to work started ticking.
Unwilling to chase returns as stocks quickly rebounded to new records in 2019, Fir Tree however held off. It told pension funds, endowments, and sovereign wealth funds that made commitments of between $10 million and $25 million to the fund that there was no pressure to participate yet, the person familiar with the trading said.

The team has until the end of 2020 to spend the full amount.

Investing.com – The Dow moved well off its lows Friday as the House of Representatives passed the $2 trillion coronavirus fiscal stimulus package, just as infections in the U.S. surged, overtaking that of Italy and China. President Donald Trump reportedly is expected to sign the bill into law at 4 PM ET (20:00 GMT). 
The Dow fell 2.12%, or 477 points, the S&P 500 slipped 1.56% and the Nasdaq Composite fell 1.85%.
The successful passage of the bill, which lawmakers hope will stem the economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic, comes as U.S. infections topped 90,000, above China's 81,000 and Italy's nearly 87,000.
The bill includes measures to support the economy such as tax breaks, checks and bailouts for big businesses hurt by the outbreak.
Trump has downplayed the milestone in the U.S. and suggested the number of infections from Beijing was not entirely accurate.
""You don't know what the numbers are in China,"" Trump told reporters on Thursday, as he attributed the jump infection in the U.S to a ""tremendous"" ramp-up in testing.
Against the backdrop of rising infections worldwide, health authorities have been stepping up efforts to produce a vaccine.
The World Health Organization officials said Friday that the first patients had been enrolled in a drug trial in Norway and Spain to test coronavirus treatments.
The selloff on Wall Street was paced by a fall in energy and industrial stocks, which had led the previous three-day rally.
Energy stocks slumped 6.5%, paced by a decline in oil prices amid fears the pandemic will continue to hurt oil demand at a time when Saudi Arabia and Russia are engaged in a price war.

328,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 27, 2020 02:50PM ET</span>",Elevated Wall Street 'fear gauge' shows doubts about stock market rebound,"By April Joyner
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors hoping for calm to return to U.S. stocks will not find much comfort in Wall Street's fear gauge known as the VIX, which shows some market participants are bracing for more turbulence despite this week's bounce. 
The Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) is down nearly 20 points from its record closing high hit earlier this month but remains far above its usual levels. The index rose on Friday as U.S. stocks fell, even after the House of Representatives passed a $2.2 trillion coronavirus relief bill. It was last at 64.29.
The persistent elevation of the index, which shot to its highest level since 2008 as markets plunged, sounded a discordant note during the rally earlier this week, which took the S&P 500 nearly 18% higher from Monday's close to Thursday's close.
""I do think the VIX is too high right now,"" said Gene Goldman, chief investment officer at Cetera Investment Management. ""It's pricing in 4% stock moves per day for the foreseeable future.""
The still-high VIX reflects both the aftershock of the massive price swings investors have endured as well as deep uncertainty surrounding the trajectory of the coronavirus and its economic fallout. 
While unprecedented stimulus from the Federal Reserve and the relief bill have bolstered hopes of averting worst-case economic scenarios, forecasts remain bleak. Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), for instance, has projected a 24% year-over-year drop in U.S. gross domestic product in the second quarter as the outbreak halts business activity throughout much of the country. 
""In this respect, a VIX still hovering around 60 provides a much more sobering and fair assessment of the level of uncertainty present in markets and the global economy,"" analysts at Fathom Consulting wrote in a note to clients. 
Past bouts of extreme volatility have often taken some time to subside. The VIX was just below 50 when stocks bottomed in March 2009 after a 57% drop from their October 2007 highs during the financial crisis.
It may take months for the VIX to ease back to its usual levels, said Matt Amberson, principal at ORATS. 
Realized volatility on the S&P 500 (SPX) - a measure of actual moves on the index over the past 30 days - was at 97.4% on Friday, according to data from options analytics provider Trade Alert. By comparison, the VIX does not seem so high.
""Vol is very fair given the kind of moves that we're having,"" said Henry Schwartz, founder of Trade Alert.
Other measures, however, signal that some investors believe the selling may have already peaked. 
For options on the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (P:SPY), implied volatility, bid-ask spreads and skew have all drifted lower after surpassing 2008 levels last week, Amberson said. 
Implied volatility reflects investor expectations for market gyrations over the next month. The bid-ask spread is the gap between what sellers say they want to receive for securities and what buyers say they will pay. Skew measures the demand for puts, used to protect against downward moves, in comparison to calls, used to position for upside.
A better indicator of volatility expectations may be VIX futures rather than the VIX itself, which is not traded, said Don Dale, chief risk strategist at Equity Risk Control Group.
Front-month VIX futures (VXc1), which expire in mid-April and reflect expectations for volatility in the month following that date, have fallen even more significantly than the VIX in the past week-and-a-half. They were last trading at 51.1.

""Based on the term structure of the VIX, traders are expecting the market to be less turbulent as we move forward toward the summer,"" Dale said. ""But VIX traders are not pricing in an immediate reduction in turbulence. They're expecting April to still be volatile.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A high-temperature gauge of bank funding costs is at levels not seen since the 2008 financial crisis. But rather than signaling stress among major lenders, it is showing the biggest demand for cash the world has ever seen, industry sources said.
The gauge, known as the Libor-OIS Spread, is an imperfect measure of extra interest big banks pay for longer-term financing than the cost of overnight funds.
The spread for three-month debt  on Friday was an astounding 1.38 percentage points, twice as high as anytime in the last 10 years. During the 2008 crisis, it climbed above 3.5 percentage points.
Big spreads have historically suggested that banks were having trouble borrowing. But this time, market experts say, it is an indication of unprecedented demand for cash as companies and individuals try to stay afloat while the coronavirus pandemic chokes off income.
""The real economy is looking to raise cash,"" said Josh Younger, a fixed-income market strategist at JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM). ""When you have a rush for funding, it percolates through to this spread. It does not reflect a bank funding crisis like we saw in 2008.""
Corporations are drawing down credit lines and trying to borrow more cash from banks to make up for shortfalls at a time when huge economies are all but shut down to prevent coronavirus from spreading. They have also been taking back cash that was parked in money-market funds that, in turn, lend to banks.
(See Reuters graphic breaking down the novel coronavirus in the U.S. - https://graphics.reuters.com/HEALTH-CORONAVIRUS-USA/0100B5K8423/index.htm)
NEED FOR CASH
Credit concerns about banks and the loans they made may surface at some point during this crisis, but that has not happened yet, said a longtime Wall Street executive with expertise in funding markets, who was not authorized to speak publicly. For now, the need for cash is more than enough to explain the spread, he said.
Major public corporations have announced new loans and draws on credit lines of $208 billion during the coronavirus panic through Thursday, according to research by JPMorgan analyst Vivek Juneja. That figure had nearly doubled since Sunday, and does not reflect borrowing from smaller companies, or those that do not need to file disclosures.
Institutional money market funds which corporations use to hold cash have suffered redemptions in the last month of $102 billion, or 31% of their assets, according to JPMorgan.
New Federal Reserve programs to support money-market funds and commercial paper borrowing, which lasts for a few weeks, should help satisfy the corporate cash demand, according to a report by  Barclays  (LON:BARC) fixed-income analyst Joseph Abate.
That would take some pressure off dollar funding costs generally.
Still, the Fed programs are just getting started and may have to be tweaked before the Libor-OIS levels come back down, Abate noted.

(Reuters) - Bank of America Corp (N:BAC) is better positioned to focus on operations rather than financial risk during the coronavirus outbreak, thanks to regulatory safeguards put in place after the financial crisis in 2008, Chief Executive Brian Moynihan said on Friday.
""What's different this time is clearly our capital liquidity,"" Moynihan said in a CNBC interview. ""Everything that changed has led the banking industry be in a great condition to service clients continuously for the last few weeks as this thing has hit.""
The second largest U.S. bank by assets has extended more than $50 billion in loans this so far month to commercial clients looking for cash to survive the coronavirus recession. The retail division has fielded more than 150,000 requests to defer payments on mortgages and auto loans. Many requests are managed digitally, he said.
The bank has also been hiring and reallocating employees to the consumer bank to help manage a surge in requests related to the pandemic, according to a memo seen by Reuters. So far this month the Charlotte-based bank has hired 2,000 people and shifted 3,000 internal employees to support its consumer bank. 
Bank of America followed its peers like  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS),  Citigroup  Inc (N:C) and  Wells Fargo  & Co (N:WFC) in reassuring employees that they would not be immediately hit by layoffs as a result of the pandemic. In the memo sent to employees on Friday, the bank said it ""will not do layoffs or job reductions in 2020 due to coronavirus impacts."" 
""We don't want our teammates to worry about their jobs during a time like this,"" Moynihan said.

PARIS (Reuters) - Ratings agency Standard & Poors placed Airbus (PA:AIR) on its watch list for a possible downgrade as doubts surfaced over the future level of aircraft deliveries and advance payments from airlines battered by the coronavirus crisis.
Airbus said earlier this week a large majority of its airlines continued to pay pre-delivery payments or advances against future deliveries, and that it would adjust production to cope with any gaps.
But S&P said it was concerned delays could weaken the company's A+ credit profile and industry sources said the pre-delivery payments currently flowing through were ones that had already received financing before the crisis began.
""In the short term, we assume no deliveries or pre-delivery payments, but that Airbus will continue production,"" said S&P Global Ratings credit analyst Tuomas E. Ekholm in a statement. 
The move came a day after Fitch cut the outlook on Airbus debt to negative, citing the risk to its A- rating of deferrals of aircraft deliveries. Both agencies noted Airbus' historically strong liquidity but Fitch said its profile had been affected in part by a recent record 3.6-billion-euro bribery fine.
Based on Airbus' average delivery and production volumes, S&P estimated a funding gap of 5 billion euros a month.
Reuters reported earlier in March that Airbus had signaled a cash requirement of some 5.5 billion euros a month in discussions with the German government.
Airbus this week said it had boosted liquidity to 30 billion euros by adding 10 billion to credit lines on a commercial basis. It has not so far followed the U.S. aerospace sector in appealing for government-backed funds to tackle the crisis.
It also said it could use its Airbus Bank subsidiary to tap liquidity from the European Central Bank. Airbus bought the small Bavarian bank in 2014.
Airbus first looked at acquiring a bank in 2010 at a time then it wanted a safe harbor for its ample cash while banks were seeing their own ratings cut, but the aircraft and real estate lender is now seen as a potential source of liquidity.
According to the bank's 2018 report, it had a tender potential at the Bundesbank worth 105 million euros as well as committed Airbus credit lines worth 467 million and interbank lines for 95 million at the end of that year.
Beyond that, ECB-eligible bonds can if needed be transferred from Airbus to Airbus Bank and used as collateral to generate liquidity by participating in ECB tenders via the Bundesbank, according to people familiar with the system.

Fitch said Airbus benefits from ECB liquidity support under a 750-billion-euro ""Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme,"" which enables the purchase of Airbus commercial paper as long as the coronavirus crisis lasts.

(Reuters) - Doubts about the fate of the U.S. economy in the face of the coronavirus hammered Wall Street again on Friday, halting its best three-day bounce in almost a century as the number of cases across the country skyrocketed.
The United States surpassed China as the nation with the most number of COVID-19 cases, putting more pressure on lawmakers to flood the country with cash to support businesses and families.
""We have still not fully understood the degree of the economic impact,"" said Massud Ghaussy, senior analyst at Nasdaq IR Intelligence in New York.
""Currently, from a policymaker's perspective, it's a relative balance between managing the spread of the virus and opening the economy.""
The U.S. House of Representatives is widely expected to clear a $2 trillion economic rescue package after the Senate passed the proposal on Thursday.
The stimulus bill and unprecedented policy easing by the Federal Reserve have set the S&P 500 (SPX) for its best week in over a decade, but it is still down 14% in March and on pace for its worst month since the height of the financial crisis.
The Dow Jones (DJI), briefly establishing a bull market on Thursday, is on course for its biggest weekly gain since 1938, largely helped by a stunning four-day rally for  Boeing Co  (N:BA).
But with growing fears of a global recession, traders expect more wild swings in financial markets until there are signs of new virus cases peaking and sweeping restrictions placed on entire countries being lifted.
A record 3 million surge in U.S. weekly jobless claims offered the first glimpse of the extent of the economic hit from the outbreak.
""We're not out of the woods yet on the health or economic crisis,"" said Eddie Perkin, chief equity investment officer at  Eaton  (NYSE:ETN) Vance in Boston.
""It would seem odd to me if the markets fully stabilize before we get more clarity on the health front.""
At 11:18 a.m. ET the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) was down 595.76 points, or 2.64%, at 21,956.41, the S&P 500 (SPX) was down 61.81 points, or 2.35%, at 2,568.26 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) was down 188.82 points, or 2.42%, at 7,608.72.
Delta Airlines (N:DAL), United Airlines (O:UAL) and American Airlines (O:AAL) fell between 4% and 8% as U.S. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said the aid designated for airlines in the package was not a bailout and that taxpayers would need to be compensated.
Boeing shed 10% after gaining as much as 90% this week, as Mnuchin said the planemaker had no intention of participating in the package. 
The banking index <.SPXBK> fell 5%, tracking U.S. Treasury yields, while oil majors  Exxon Mobil  (N:XOM) and  Chevron  Corp (N:CVX) fell about 6%, following a drop in oil prices.
Declining issues outnumbered advancers for a 4.58-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and 3.63-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.

The S&P index recorded no new 52-week high and one new low, while the Nasdaq recorded four new highs and 19 new lows.

338,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 27, 2020 12:25PM ET</span>","U.S. regulators give banks relief on accounting standard, derivatives rule","By Pete Schroeder
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. banking regulators announced Friday that banks would have the option of ignoring the capital implications of a new global accounting standard for two years in a bid to ensure banks continue lending through the pandemic.
The Federal Reserve, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency also voted to allow banks to adopt early a new methodology for measuring counterparty credit risk in derivatives transactions, now functional at the end of March. Regulators said the early adoption could ""smooth disruptions"" in the market.
The regulatory tweaks mark the latest in a long-running effort by regulators to ease rules on banks amid the coronavirus pandemic, in a bid to ensure they continue lending and supporting the economy.
Specifically, regulators said banks will be able to ignore potentially higher capital requirements they might face under a new global accounting standard. The ""current expected credit loss"" standard requires banks to estimate potential future losses on loans, which banks have argued could be particularly problematic in the current stressed environment.
Banks now would have the option of delaying for two years the capital impact of the new standard, followed by a three-year transition period. The regulatory relief comes as Congress is poised to pass sweeping economic relief legislation that would have allow banks to ignore the standard for a year.

Separately, the regulators also agreed to allow banks to adopt their new rule on measuring counterparty risk a quarter early if they want. Regulators said by allowing banks to use the new rule sooner, beginning at the end of March, it would give firms access to a more risk-sensitive framework during a volatile time.

344,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 27, 2020 11:26AM ET</span>",From quills to qwerty: Lloyd's underwriters adapt to home working,"By Carolyn Cohn, Noor Zainab Hussain and Jonathan Saul
LONDON (Reuters) - Thousands of London's underwriters took their stamps and fountain pens home last week, which they use to sign insurance contracts, but they won't need them.
Working at home due to the coronavirus lockdown, they have abandoned the normal tools of their trade and are turning to email and other electronic systems to agree terms with the brokers who put business their way.
It's a huge change from a normal day at Lloyd's of London [SOLYD.UL] in the heart of the capital's financial district, where underwriters receive queues of brokers at their desks to haggle over terms, before sealing the deals with an old-fashioned company stamp and an ink signature.
Each deal can require up to 20 signatures and stamps.
With the closure of the underwriters' floor, the world’s leading commercial insurance market, Lloyd's - which started life in Edward Lloyd's' coffee house in 1688 - has gone fully online for the first time.
The lockdown could prove a watershed moment. If the shift goes off without any major hitches, it will likely smooth the way for the market to go far more digital, underwriters and brokers said. 
So the mass working from home is effectively a test of the business's prospects for long-term survival as it looks to cut costs and modernize in the face of overseas competition.
""Edward Lloyd's coffee shop was a social environment where merchant traders could gather - today you have the internet, you have mobile phones,"" said Bruce Carman, chief underwriting officer of insurance firm Hive Aero, who has worked in the Lloyd's market for more than 30 years.
""The speed of trade should be far quicker than someone traipsing around the marketplace in leather shoes.""
GOODBYE TO ALL THAT?
Lloyd's runs a market of more than 90 underwriting firms, who price specialist risks from ships to sculptures. Hundreds of broking firms arrange insurance deals between their corporate clients and the Lloyd's underwriters. 
Lloyd's already had a plan to move to electronic exchanges, but many brokers and underwriters had resisted, arguing complex transactions were more easily handled face to face. 
The shutdown highlights how the coronavirus crisis is putting a brake on centuries-old traditions.
Lloyd's was focused on shipping when it started 332 years ago and, until the closure, a bell still rang on the underwriting floor when a ship sank at sea, and marine insurers recorded the shipwrecks in a loss book with quill pens.
The bell was rung last week to mark the shutting of the so-called ""underwriting room"" in response to the pandemic.
CORONAVIRUS CLAIMS
The lockdown comes as the insurance industry braces for hefty claims linked to the virus outbreak due to supply chain disruption and cancellation or postponement of sports events and other mass gatherings, including the Olympics.
Lloyd's, which took in 36 billion pounds ($44 billion) in premium revenue last year, and turned a profit after two years of losses, may benefit from the market's need to adapt in a hurry, CEO John Neal told Reuters.
""People want to accelerate the modernization agenda,"" he said.
Underwriters and brokers are already able to process part or all of a trade electronically through platforms such as PPL. But many have preferred not to do so.
Sue Jacobek, managing director of PPL, said that since the underwriting room closed, the number of users on the system had risen by 15% and 150 people a day were going online to learn how to use it.
Dan Hearsum, head of placement, UK specialties, at insurance broker Marsh, said his team would normally hold 200-300 face-to-face meetings with clients over the space of a few weeks. These have been replaced by video calls, while staff morale has been kept up by internal teams video-chatting wearing ""silly hats"".
""We want to make sure the banter that was going on in the office before can still go on.""
KEITH RICHARDS' HANDS
Alex Craggs, chief underwriting officer at insurer Antares, said the firm was ""adapting as best we can"" to home working, but that it was hard to replicate face-to-face trading exactly.
""There's a greater danger now we'll overlook the nuance of a risk because we are looking at it on a piece of paper.""
Lloyd's prides itself on pricing large, complicated risks. It reportedly insured Rolling Stones guitarist Keith Richards' hands for $1.6 million and Kiss frontman Gene Simmons' tongue for more than $1 million.
Working from home could make those deals harder.
""When you have a complex renewable negotiation, which is difficult even in an office, and when underwriters are at home and physically cut off from their colleagues, it begs the question how feasible this is going to be,"" one senior insurance industry executive said.
""This is a stress test for electronic trading,"" he added. ""When claims come through over COVID-19, how will the system hold up?""

347,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 27, 2020 11:10AM ET</span>",Explainer: Why U.S. gig economy workers need an act of Congress to get jobless pay,"By Tina Bellon
NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. gig economy workers such as Uber and app-based delivery drivers would be allowed to claim unemployment benefits under a $2 trillion package awaiting final congressional votes Friday, but how those benefits will be distributed is not clear.
Until now, people who work as contractors for platforms such as Uber have not had access to unemployment benefits reserved for full-time employees of traditional businesses. 
Here is a look at the situation of gig economy workers and the obstacles they face to receive unemployment pay.
Why are U.S. gig workers generally not entitled to unemployment benefits?
Most government safety net benefits including health insurance, sick pay, workers' compensation and unemployment insurance are attached to an employment relationship, said Pauline Kim, an employment law professor at Washington University in St. Louis.
Companies including  Uber Technologies Inc  (N:UBER),  Lyft  Inc (O:LYFT), GrubHub Inc (N:GRUB), DoorDash Inc and Postmates save money by not paying costly benefits and offloading some of the traditional employer-side responsibilities on to workers the platforms classify as independent contractors.
The companies say many workers use their services to supplement income from other full or part-time jobs that offer benefits and cherish the flexibility that comes with being a contractor.
What obstacles must gig workers overcome to receive unemployment pay under current law?
State authorities use data on wages submitted by employers to calculate unemployment pay. Gig economy companies do not report that information, making it difficult for drivers to claim unemployment benefits.
Some drivers in California and New York have filed for jobless pay regardless, arguing they have been misclassified as contractors.
If the worker is deemed misclassified, the state can demand reimbursement from the company. But local officials make case-by-case determinations that are not binding for other applicants, said Veena Dubal an employment law professor at the University of California Hastings. 
What is changing with the federal coronavirus bill?
Under the Coronavirus Relief Bill, contractors and self-employed workers are included for unemployment benefits if they can show they have been affected by COVID-19. 
The requirements are defined broadly and should allow nearly every gig worker to claim benefits, said Bryan Lazarski, a labor and employment lawyer. 
The program offers up to 39 weeks of benefits based on the most recent tax return, with per-week payout levels depending on the state of the worker. Workers receive an additional $600 per week for up to four months.
What documents do gig workers have to submit?
It is still unclear what paperwork they will need to submit. The U.S. Department of Labor is expected to issue guidelines soon, said Susan Houseman, vice president at the Upjohn Institute for Employment Research.
The coronavirus package refers to laws invoked during natural disasters. Under those laws, some states allow self-employed workers to submit check stubs, bank statements, work orders and affidavits as proof of income, Houseman said. 
Does the federal bill change anything about gig workers' status?

The bill is limited to the current coronavirus crisis and the year 2020. It does not include reforms of the current unemployment system.

348,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 27, 2020 11:05AM ET</span>",European hedge funds struggle as short-selling bans disrupt strategies,"By Maiya Keidan and Clara Denina 
LONDON (Reuters) - European hedge funds struggled to navigate the coronavirus-induced extreme market volatility during March, with many down by double-digits in the space of a few weeks as short-selling bans hampered their strategies. 
Regulators in France, Italy, Belgium and Spain ordered temporary short-selling bans to stop investors betting on a fall in the share price of companies ranging from Spanish bank Santander (MC:SAN) to Air France-KLM (PA:AIRF) and Italian automaker  Fiat  Chrysler (MI:FCHA).
Short-selling is a strategy often used by so-called 'event-driven' or 'merger-arbitrage' hedge funds that bet on takeover or merger deals, reducing their risk by shorting, or selling, the acquirer and buying the target company.
But sources said the short-selling bans prevented such funds deploying their strategies against a number of companies, including French payment firm Worldline's (PA:WLN) planned acquisition of peer  Ingenico  (PA:INGC),  Alstom  SA's (PA:ALSO) purchase of Bombardier's (TO:BBDb) rail division and Ray-Ban maker EssilorLuxottica's (PA:ESLX) bid for Dutch opticians group GrandVision (AS:GVNV).
""Short-selling bans amplified market movements in recent days and hit several long-short equity and event-driven strategies,"" Philippe Ferreira, Senior Cross Asset Strategist at Lyxor Asset Management told Reuters.
So-called long-short funds struggled. Legg Mason's 147 million euro ($161.92 million) European fund lost 16.3% in the month to March 25 and was down 20% year to date, while Lansdowne’s European Absolute Opportunities Fund lost 14.8% in the year to March 20 and its Princay Fund was down 46.4% over the same period, according to data compiled by HSBC.
Britain's Man Group lost 6% in its $354 million Enhanced European long-short offshore hedge fund, run by Neil Mason and Ikitsa Anastasov, in the month through March 20 and 5.3% over the 12 months to the same date, the HSBC data showed.
All of the funds declined to comment.
UNWINDING
Jack Inglis, CEO of hedge fund trade body AIMA, told Reuters that one of the main reasons pension funds, insurance companies and endowments choose to invest in hedge funds is for their ability to mitigate risk in periods of market turmoil. 
""In the current volatile market, short selling is, above all, a critical risk mitigation tool which enables hedge fund managers to protect their clients’ money,"" he said.
While short-selling bans only legally prevent investors taking new positions, bankers told Reuters many hedge funds feel forced to unwind existing short bets because they can no longer manage one side of their position.
""The virus is something but then...you have the oil price...and then on top of that, you had the short-selling ban,"" said one banker who works with hedge funds. ""The three things combined destroyed anything in the event-driven space.""
""I have done September 11, the financial crisis but I have never seen a case like this where everything implodes together at the same time within a week with no liquidity.""
Hedge fund platform Millennium Management, which has four to five merger-arbitrage teams, according to a source close to the firm, was down 4.3% in the year through March 20.
Regulatory filings show Millennium had short positions in several companies covered by the bans, including French car part company  Faurecia  (PA:EPED), which is being spun off by  Peugeot  (PA:PEUP) as part of the automaker's tie-up with Italy's Fiat Chrysler.
However, Lyxor's Ferreira said several strategies had started to recover this week. 
Farringdon Capital Management's $160 million Alpha One fund was down 16.2% in the month to March 24, according to HSBC's data, but a spokesman told Reuters it was only down 12.6% for the month to March 26.
Man Group's Enhanced European long-short fund had also recovered slightly to a negative performance of 3.7% in the month to March 25, according to a source close to the firm.

""Our hedge had already paid off prior to my going on CNBC,"" Ackman, wrote to his Pershing Square (NYSE:SQ) Capital Management investors late Thursday. ""The idea that my appearance pushed the market down an additional 4% that day is absurd.""
Ackman told CNBC on March 18 that he thought the best approach to killing off the coronavirus was to close the borders and shut down the entire country, barring essential services, for 30 days. ""Hell is coming, shut it down now,"" he told CNBC.
The S&P 500 was off 6.5% when he began speaking and fell more and the Dow Industrial Average, already off 1,000 points when he began, hit a circuit breaker as he spoke and reopened down 2,000 points.
In Thursday's letter, Ackman said ""some press reports had raised questions about his appearance"" and questioned whether he ""intended to drive down the market so that we could profit on hedges we had previously entered into.""
Last week investors said the interview unnerved already jittery shareholders. ""Please get Ackman off CNBC before people start jumping off bridges,"" prominent investor Mike Novogratz tweeted during the interview. 
Ackman said in the letter that he had sold more than half the hedge before the show and sold the balance over the next three trading days. ""The hedge did not increase in value during or after I went on CNBC,"" the letter said.
Pershing Square earned roughly $2.6 billion by hedging its stock portfolio through credit protection on investment grade and high yield credit indices. Much of the money has been reinvested in stocks the firm already owns.

For two years, Ackman had stayed largely out of the public eye to resuscitate his loss-battered portfolio which rebounded with a record 58% gain in 2019. He returned last Wednesday with an early morning tweet and the CNBC interview and has followed up with more interviews to explain his thinking.

At the same time, Mnuchin said in an interview with Fox Business Network that plane-maker  Boeing Co  (N:BA) has not requested government help. 
""I've been very clear this is not an airline bailout,"" Mnuchin said. ""And that taxpayers need to be compensated for relief they're giving to airlines.""
U.S. airlines are preparing to tap the government for up to $25 billion in grants to cover payroll in a sharp travel downturn triggered by the coronavirus, even after the government warned it may take stakes in exchange for bailout funds, people familiar with the matter said.
Mnuchin can demand equity, warrants or other financial instruments in order to ""provide appropriate compensation to the federal government."" A Treasury spokeswoman declined to comment on a report that Mnuchin would demand equity.
Airlines can ask for the equivalent of their payroll between April 1 and Sept. 30 of last year, according to the terms of the bill, meaning some large airlines could get $4 billion or more in total.
The House of Representatives planned to debate the legislation on Friday, then schedule a vote.
Mnuchin said Boeing said it does not intend to participate in the federal program. ""Boeing has said that they have no intention of using a program that may change in the future,"" Mnuchin said. ""These are things that the companies need to come and ask us for. ... Right now Boeing's saying they don't need it.""

Asked if the large stimulus bill could help avoid a recession, Mnuchin told Fox Business, ""The No. 1 issue is not what the economic numbers are right now, the No. 1 issue is the hardship to the American people who are losing their jobs.""

Short-time work is a form of state aid that allows employers to switch employees to shorter working hours during an economic downturn to keep them on the payroll. It has been widely used by industry, including Germany's car sector.
The spokesman said Lufthansa had not yet applied for state aid but was in talks with various banks and authorities about what kind of help would be possible if the airline needed it.

He said around 700 of Lufthansa's roughly 760 planes were currently grounded.

393,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 27, 2020 09:25AM ET</span>","'This is a war and we want to survive,' says Polish retailer","WARSAW (Reuters) - Polish fashion retailers may not survive the coronavirus crisis if the government, banks and shopping mall owners do not help them bear the costs, a lobby group said on Friday, as Poland closed non-essential shops to stop the spread of the virus.
A new lobby group set up by the retail industry said it has asked the state to help pay out salaries, shopping mall owners to stop taking rents and banks to suspend loan payments. The group says it represents 100 companies and that 200,000 jobs directly depend on their survival.
""This is not even a crisis, it is difficult to name it. It is unlike anything that has happened before....This is a war and we want to survive. I do not care what the financial results will be,"" Marek Piechocki, Chief Executive at Poland's biggest fashion retailer LPP told Rzeczpospolita daily.
He said LPP, a home-grown rival to the likes of H&M and  Inditex  (MC:ITX), had enough resources to continue paying salaries for the next 4-6 months. Before the crisis it had hoped to reach revenue of 10.5 billion zlotys ($2.73 billion) this year.
Tomasz Ciapala, the CEO and majority owner of Lancerto, a men's suit maker, said that many workers in the industry are paralyzed with fear about their jobs. 
""Our union comprises mostly family businesses. Most of our employees, who have been with us for a long time, are scared. This has wide social effects. Mental illness, depression, suicides - these are all side effects of joblessness,"" Ciapala told a videconference on Friday. 
Pawel Kaplon, a partner at Paan Capital private equity fund, has compared the functioning of fashion retailers to a large-scale restaurant which has hired suppliers and staff and bought products to prepare dishes for the next 100 days. And now has to shut down. 
""We have done the cooking for the next half a year, we have payments ahead and we have nowhere to get the cash flow from,"" Kaplon told the same conference.
Poland's parliament is expected to adopt on Friday a package of legislation designed to help the economy and various industries survive the coronavirus crisis.

""The shopping malls, banks and us should participate in these costs together ...as in the end each of us will win when this tsunami is over,"" said Igor Klaja, the founder of popular sports wear brand 4F.

394,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 27, 2020 09:25AM ET</span>",China gives chilly response to request for U.S. journalists to remain in country,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China hit out at what it called ""biased"" reporting on Friday in a frosty response to a request by three major U.S. newspapers to reverse the expulsion of several of their China-based journalists.
China announced on March 18 it was revoking the press accreditations of all American journalists in the China bureaus of the New York Times (NYT.N), Wall Street Journal (NWSA.O) and Washington Post, which were due to expire at the end of 2020.
In an open letter published earlier this week, the three publishers urged China to reconsider the move, saying it was ""uniquely damaging and reckless"" at a time when the world is sharing the burden of fighting the coronavirus.
China's Foreign Ministry said in a statement on its website that it welcomed media and reporters from all countries to report in China ""in accordance with laws and regulations"" but that it did not accept ""the arrogance and prejudice"" it said was revealed in the letter of the three publishers. 
The statement did not directly answer the newspapers' request but suggested Beijing was in no mood to accept it.
""The Chinese people do not welcome reports that are not objective and not fair,"" said the statement.
""Faced with the escalating political suppression and discriminatory practices of the United States, do you expect China to be merely a 'silent lamb'""?
The ministry reiterated that the blame for the situation lay with Washington, rather than Beijing, for first restricting the number of Chinese media in the United States.
Last month, Washington demanded journalists from Chinese state media be registered as staff of diplomatic missions, saying it was a reponse to the growing crackdown on independent reporting in China.
China then expelled three Wall Street Journal reporters - two Americans and an Australian - after the paper published an opinion column calling China the ""real sick man of Asia"".
In early March, the United States ordered four Chinese news organisations to slash their staff by around a third, impacting 60 reporters.
The Foreign Ministry described the move as unreasonable and driven by ""ideological bias"".
The ministry also lashed out at the connection made in the letter between the timing of the journalists' expulsion and the need to report on China's coronavirus epidemic. 

China has bristled at accusations by U.S. officials that it covered up the earlier stages of the virus, exacerbating tension between the world's top two economies.

396,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 27, 2020 08:50AM ET</span>","Alitalia seeks to place 2,900 more staff in layoff scheme: document","MILAN (Reuters) - Alitalia's administrator has asked Italy's government to raise to nearly 7,000 the number of its employees under a temporary lay-off scheme, with most of its aircraft standing idle during the coronavirus outbreak.
The request for 2,900 more workers to join the scheme came on Thursday in a letter sent by the state-appointed administrator to unions and government ministries and seen by Reuters.
Alitalia's total workforce is around 11,600.
Under the state-sponsored scheme, which existed before the epidemic, workers remain at home for a certain period but are not laid off as the company adjusts employment levels to market demand. The Alitalia staff would expect to remain on it until the end of October, the letter stated.
Rome is preparing to take control of the loss-making carrier again after 11 years of difficult private management and two failed restructuring attempts, problems exacerbated by the coronavirus crisis that has devastated the global airline industry.
The airline, which has been run by administrators since May 2017, will be re-launched as a new company that could start with 25-30 aircraft - around a quarter of the current fleet - and then gradually increase that number as the sector recovers, union sources said this week.
It is not yet clear what the government's plans are for Alitalia's current workforce.
The request for additional temporary lay-offs will be discussed on April 3, according to union sources. A separate meeting on the carrier's relaunch between the government and unions is planned for Monday.

Private investors who sent expression of interests for Alitalia before the government decided it would nationalize it could become minority shareholders in the new carrier, sources have told Reuters.

(Reuters) - Leading British fashion chain  Next  (L:NXT) has bowed to pressure from workers worried about their health and shut its online business, cutting off its remaining source of revenue during the coronavirus outbreak.
Rival British retailer Marks and Spencer (L:MKS) has taken a different tack, maintaining its online operations and citing government advice that people should use home delivery services to avoid going out if possible.
Next had closed all its stores on Monday, a day before Britain went on lockdown, but continued to run its online business.
""Next has listened very carefully to its colleagues working in warehousing and distribution operations to fulfill online orders. It is clear that many increasingly feel they should be at home in the current climate,"" the company said.
""Next has therefore taken the difficult decision to temporarily close its online, warehousing and distribution operations,"" it said.
At 1215 GMT, Next shares were down 8.7% at 41.16 pounds.
Next, whose Chief Executive Simon Wolfson represents the ruling Conservative party in the upper house of parliament, generates around half of its revenue from its online business.
A number of retailers are having to scale back or halt their online activities to try to safeguard their workers' health.
Amazon.com (O:AMZN) said last week it would stop shipping non-essential products to consumers in Italy and France, due to a spike in orders and the need to respect anti-coronavirus safety measures in the workplace.
BACK TO BASICS
Other fashion retailers in Europe are trying to keep their online business going.
Spain's  Inditex  (MC:ITX), the company behind the Zara brand, has also said its online business remains in operation.
Online retailer ASOS (L:ASOS), which has a large fully automated warehouse in the northern English town of Barnsley, with on average 300 people per shift, is also still running.
However, people's orders reflect the current crisis.
Items currently selling well include everyday basics such as socks, underwear, leggings and children's wear, an M&S spokeswoman said.
That echoes comments from Europe's biggest pure online fashion retailer Zalando (DE:ZALG) which said this week that demand for athleisure and gear for yoga and running has risen as people are forced to work – and exercise – at home.
With all of Britain's shops closed, apart from food stores, pharmacies and corner shops, there has been a growing backlash against retailers who continue to sell online.
Next said last week it could sustain a hit from coronavirus of more than 1 billion pounds ($1.2 billion), or 25% of annual sales, without exceeding its debt and bank facilities.

LONDON (Reuters) - Investors rushed into cash and out of bonds at a record pace over the past week as the coronavirus pandemic caused mayhem in markets, BofA said on Friday, though it noted a key positioning signal at ""maximum bearish"" could signal a big rally ahead.
BofA's weekly fund flows data based on figures from EPFR Global showed a record $234.6 billion had made their way into cash funds in the week to Wednesday while another record of $109 billion was registered in redemptions from bond funds. 
The bank noted record $61.2 billion outflow from investment grade debt and ""monster"" $17.1 billion outflows from emerging bonds. Bond outflows totalled a ""stunning"" $218 billion in the past two weeks and $257 billion over the past month, it noted.
""The bond bubble pops,"" the report said, adding the past four weeks' redemptions had unwound 44% of ""bubble inflows of $583 billion in the prior 52 weeks."" 
(Graphic: BofA chart, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/4029/3985/Pasted%20Image.jpg) 
Equity funds meanwhile shed $26.2 billion, with U.S. share funds down $15.8 billion, the data showed.
The data, however, does not capture the market rebound seen in the past three sessions that boosted New York's Dow Jones on Tuesday to its biggest one-day rise since 1933, thanks to central banks promising ""whatever it takes"" to ensure liquidity and a $2 trillion U.S. coronavirus relief bill. 
Before that, between February 19 and March 23, an MSCI index of world stocks (MIWD00000PUS), fell about 35%.
BofA said its Bull & Bear Indicator - a key market measure it used to track positioning - had hit zero, a level it described as ""maximum bearish"".
That potentially implies a substantial rebound in credit and stock markets if the stimulus plans of the Federal Reserve and the U.S. government succeed, the bank added.
That could be borne out by the present rally, which was undeterred even after Thursday data showing nearly 3.3 million Americans had filed for unemployment benefits in the past week, eclipsing the previous record of 695,000 set in 1982.
(Graphic: BofA B&B, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/4033/3989/Pasted%20Image.jpg)
BofA also said the equity allocations of its private clients had fallen to 52.8%, the lowest since February 2013. 
While the U.S. job data shows how deep the incoming recession will likely be, some investors are hoping that additional stimulus from the Donald Trump administration will further cushion the blow. 
BofA noted the Bull & Bear indicator had hit zero in July 2008 but that rally had been aborted by the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy four weeks later.

""The big difference in this crash is that policy panic (happened) before not after the credit event; if Fed bazooka short-circuits a systemic bankruptcy, the combo of max bearish positioning and max policy stimulus equate to big rally in credit and stock markets,"" it added.

399,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 27, 2020 08:18AM ET</span>",Maker of Purell Hand Sanitizer Denied in Request for Trump Tariff Relief,"(Bloomberg) -- With the U.S. now surpassing all other countries in the number of coronavirus cases and health experts estimating the peak may still be weeks away, President Donald Trump’s administration is having a harder time defending tariffs on health-related goods imported from China.
That’s especially true for products used in the U.S. response to the pandemic that are in high demand but running short on supply, such as ventilators, surgical masks and hand sanitizers.
Gojo Industries, the inventor and manufacturer of Purell-branded products, builds its hand-sanitizer and soap dispensers in the U.S., but a key input that ensures the dispensers work is made in China and subject to a 25% duty.
In a tariff-exemption request last year, Akron, Ohio-based Gojo said it’s exploring third-country sourcing but added that unilaterally moving production would require reverse engineering of a key chip that’s manufactured by a Canadian company in China. “Such action would violate their intellectual property” and Gojo “does not control the ability to move that production,” the submission reads.
The U.S. Trade Representative denied Gojo’s request earlier this month, saying the company failed to show that the duties “would cause severe economic harm to you or other U.S. interests,” according to USTR General Counsel Joseph Barloon’s letter on March 5.
Three weeks later, the USTR issued exemptions for Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) watches and a range of other products that have no apparent link to Covid-19.
The USTR didn’t respond when asked if the Gojo denial would be reassessed as part of a new exclusion process to identify more products needed to treat the virus or limit its outbreak.
Publicly, American officials have doubled down on their tariff strategy and are calling for a rethink of supply chains, especially when it comes to key medical products.
The reliance on other countries for those supplies has created a strategic vulnerability for the U.S., trade chief Robert Lighthizer said. “By encouraging diversification of supply chains and — better yet — more manufacturing in the U.S., President Trump’s economic and trade policies are helping to overcome that vulnerability,” he wrote in a Wall Street Journal editorial last week."

BOSTON (Reuters) - Medical waste company Stericycle (O:SRCL) and investment firm Saddle Point Management reached a settlement that hands the firm, founded by a former Pershing Square (NYSE:SQ) Capital Management partner, two board seats, said two sources familiar the matter.
Stericycle will expand its 10-member board to 12 people and offer seats to James Martell, a former  XPO Logistics  (N:XPO) director, and James Welch, a former chief executive at YRC Worldwide (O:YRCW).
The men were nominated by Saddle Point and bring expertise in trucking and logistics at a time some Stericycle investors have asked the $3.8 billion company to cut costs, pay down debt and sell non-core assets. Saddle Point did not press for any changes publicly.
Stericycle and Saddle Point were not immediately available for comment.
New York-based Saddle Point was founded two years ago by Roy Katzovicz, who had been chief legal officer and an investment team member at William Ackman's activist hedge fund Pershing Square Capital Management.
Until now, Katzovicz has largely stayed out of the public eye. He has made a few behind the scenes investments in companies including Sprout Pharmaceuticals and BacterioScan Inc, a point-of-care and rapid diagnostic device development and manufacturing company.
Saddle Point requested and received confidential treatment from the Securities and Exchange Commission to build the stake.
Stericycle is the dominant U.S. medical waste company that disposes syringes, used gloves, and bloody bandages among other things for hospitals and doctors' and dentists' offices. It is also active in document and data shredding.
After having gone public in 1996, the company grew by buying up competitors. Its stock price climbed from $2.31 at the IPO to $141 in 2015. But rapid growth came at a price and the company's international expansion was more uneven. Its stock price closed at $43.15 on Thursday.
In 2017 the company paid $295 million to settle a class-action lawsuit which charged the company engaged in a price-increasing scheme that automatically increased clients' bills.
The company last year promoted Cindy Miller to chief executive after she joined as president and chief operating officer in 2018 after nearly 30 years at UPS.
Several prominent activist investors including Carl Icahn, Elliott Management and Starboard Value have made demands more publicly and recently agreed to settle for board seats at companies ranging from Occidental Petroleum (N:OXY)to Twitter (N:TWTR) as the spread of the coronavirus accelerated some talks.

401,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 27, 2020 07:40AM ET</span>","Goldman, Morgan Stanley receive approvals for majority stakes in China ventures","By Zhang Yan and Julie Zhu
BEIJING/HONG KONG (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs (N:GS) and  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS) said on Friday they had received the final regulatory approvals to take majority stakes in their China securities joint ventures, as Beijing continues to open its financial sector to foreigners. 
The approvals come as policymakers and authorities step up efforts to shield the world's second-largest economy, battered by the coronavirus pandemic. 
Goldman and Morgan Stanley received the nods from the China Securities Regulatory Commission to raise their stakes in Goldman Sachs Gao Hua Securities and Morgan Stanley Huaxin Securities from 33% to 51% and 49% to 51%, respectively, the two Wall Street banks said in separate statements.
Majority ownership of the joint ventures potentially allows the U.S. banks to expand operations in China, and better integrate them with their global businesses. 
Goldman in 2004 set up its China securities JV with Beijing Gao Hua Securities, which was co-founded by veteran Chinese banker Fang Fenglei.
Unlike most of the other China JVs, Goldman already has day-to-day operational control of its JV, which offers investment banking services such as equities and bond underwriting and deal advice. 
Despite that managerial control, Goldman has long made it clear it would eventually seek to take a majority stake too.
Shanghai-based Morgan Stanley Huaxin Securities was established in 2011 and its existing operations include underwriting and sponsoring equity and debt offerings as well as proprietary trading of bonds, it says on its website. 
China raised the cap on foreign ownership of securities operations to 51% in 2018. Until then international banks had been allowed only minority stakes in their Chinese joint ventures. 
Swiss lender UBS (S:UBSG) became the first foreign bank to hold a majority stake in a China securities business under the new rules in 2018. Japanese brokerage Nomura Holdings (T:8604) and JPMorgan (N:JPM) got their approvals last year. 
 Credit Suisse  (S:CSGN) is still awaiting approval after it submitted an application for majority-controlled securities JV.
Beijing promised to scrap foreign ownership caps on securities firms and mutual funds for foreign investors from April 1, in an interim Sino-U.S. trade deal signed in January. 
The approvals for Goldman and Morgan Stanley come a day before China temporarily bars entry for most foreigners as an interim measure in response to the coronavirus epidemic.
Market participants said the thumbs up was a sign the country is continuing with the formal opening up of financial markets, despite the virus. 

Last Friday, Shanghai said some of the world's top financial institutions, including BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) and JPMorgan, were stepping up investments in China's financial hub, undeterred by the pandemic.

(Reuters) - With fewer planes flying and more security and traffic control officers testing positive for the coronavirus, airports are closing terminals, concessions and checkpoints, even while trying to retain jobs with the hope of a post-crisis pickup.
Orlando International Airport managers in Florida were this week considering turning a construction site for a runway rehabilitation into a parking lot for jets, while figuring out necessary staffing for increasingly deserted concourses.
People movers, for example, need maintenance even if they are not being used.
""You can't just let it sit there,"" said Phillip Brown, chief executive of the Greater Orlando Aviation Authority, which normally oversees millions of visitors a year to theme parks like Disney World and Universal Studios.
Those parks are closed into April and Orlando airport was instead setting up zones for screening passengers arriving from New York-area airports for the coronavirus following self-quarantine orders from Florida's governor.
Florida, nicknamed the Sunshine State, has seen an increase in people fleeing New York with ""shelter-in-place"" orders.
Delta Air Lines (N:DAL) has closed terminals in New York and Los Angeles, and is using a runway in its hometown of Atlanta to park jets that are not flying.
More than 30 jets were parked at Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport this week, a spokesman said. 
Twenty-nine U.S. Transportation Security Administration (TSA) screening officers have tested positive at airports across the country in the past two weeks, the agency says, prompting checkpoint closures.
Even with the closures, U.S. airport screening wait times - often a source of public anger - are now routinely less than 10 minutes, reflecting dramatic falls in passenger numbers.
This week, TSA screened 454,000 passengers on Sunday, down 82% from a year ago, 331,000 on Monday, 279,000 on Tuesday, and 239,000 on Wednesday.
Still, airports are hoping that $10 billion in government aid under a massive relief package expected to pass on Friday can help keep employees on payroll and ready to work once operations ramp back up, Brown said.
The stimulus deal includes $3 billion for 125,000 contracted airport workers.
But until the health crisis has passed and people start flying again, airports that only a month ago were in the midst of expansion projects will continue to downsize as the industry weathers its biggest ever downturn. 
San Francisco International Airport said it was closing some security checkpoints, creating a single Customs & Border Protection entry for international arrivals and delaying opening new gates at the revamped Harvey Milk Terminal 1, while evaluating other measures.

Fitch Ratings on Thursday revised its outlook for U.S. airport bonds to ""negative.""

MUNICH/BERLIN (Reuters) - Shares in ProSiebenSat.1 Media (DE:PSMGn) rallied by 9% on Friday after the abrupt departure of Chief Executive Officer Max Conze ended a drama-filled tenure that unraveled after his deputy denounced a ""soap opera"" at the German broadcaster.
ProSieben announced in a late-night statement that Conze, 50, was leaving with immediate effect and Chief Financial Officer Rainer Beaujean - who joined last July from a packaging company - would also assume his responsibilities.
In a statement issued after a supervisory board meeting on Thursday evening, Beaujean said ProSieben ""will now return to focusing more strongly on our core segment of entertainment and on sustainably profitable business"".
Conze had sought to accelerate a pivot to digital commerce and advertising to offset a relentless decline in ProSieben's core commercial TV franchise, but while this preserved top-line growth it squeezed profitability and pushed up debt.
The recent announcement of the $500 million takeover of New York dating app developer Meet Inc (O:MEET) incurred the disapproval of Italian broadcaster  Mediaset  (MI:MS), which took advantage of a precipitous decline in ProSieben's share price to up its stake to 20%.
Sources familiar with the matter say that Mediaset, controlled by the family of former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, wanted ProSieben to change course and concentrate on its core media business.
The Italian company has exerted steady pressure on ProSieben, resisted by Conze, to join a European media holding it is setting up to fight back against U.S. streaming giants led by Netflix (O:NFLX). Mediaset declined comment on Friday.
TAKEOVER PLAY?
Analysts at Citi said it was possible that Mediaset could partner with Czech investor Daniel Kretinsky, who owns a 10% stake in ProSieben, to make a takeover bid.
Conze's grip on the business had visibly loosened of late, with hand-picked allies he brought in from Dyson, the UK vacuum cleaner maker he headed before joining ProSieben in mid-2018, exiting the business.
Deputy CEO Conrad Albert dealt a decisive blow to Conze's prospects by criticizing ProSieben's ""boardroom soap opera"" in a newspaper interview. The company took no action for days before saying Albert would leave by mutual consent.
On a personal level, Conze is nursing losses after backing his own turnaround plan by investing 2 million euros ($2.20 million) of his own money in ProSieben stock. 
ProSieben's e-commerce bets bundled into its NuCom division - which include dating, sex toys and price comparison sites - will be sold off in due course, the company said. 

Investor General Atlantic is a minority partner in NuCom.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are set to open lower Friday, with investors adopting a cautious stance ahead of the weekend after recent strong gains and as the number of coronavirus victims rise.
At 7:50 AM ET (1150 GMT), futures for the S&P 500 traded 71 points, or 2.7%, lower, futures for the Nasdaq down 197 points, or 2.5%, while the Dow futures contract fell 619 points, or 2.8%. 
All three major indexes have posted strong double-digit gains this week despite a difficult start, with the S&P 500 and Dow posting their best three-day run since the 1930s. This is on the back of unprecedented policy easing by the U.S. Federal Reserve and hopes of a $2.2 trillion government stimulus aid bill.
Still, there’s much to be cautious about. 
The U.S. initial claims data Thursday showed the number of Americans applying for unemployment benefits surged to a record 3.28 million last week, showing the extent of the economic damage being caused by the coronavirus outbreak.
Additionally, the U.S. has now recorded the highest number of coronavirus infections of any nation, including China, according to the Johns Hopkins tracker.
In corporate news, the Cheesecake Factory (NASDAQ:CAKE) disclosed Friday that it has furloughed about 41,000 hourly employees, citing closing of dine-in restaurants on the back of the coronavirus outbreak.
ViacomCBS (NASDAQ:VIAC) pulled Friday its forecast for the year due to the impact from the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. The media company also said it experienced production delays, but saw a rise in viewership across its broadcast and cable properties.
Additionally,  Marathon Oil  (NYSE:MRO) will be in the spotlight after its debt was downgraded to BBB- by Standard & Poors, citing weak market conditions and a poor outlook. The rating agency also downgraded United States Steel Corporation (NYSE:X). to B-, citing a weaker cashflow and a negative outlook.
Investors could keep an eye on the University of Michigan’s March consumer confidence release, at 10 AM ET (14:00 GMT). 
The March consumer sentiment index is expected to drop to 90 from the preliminary measure of 95.9, according to economists’ forecasts compiled by Investing.com. 
Oil traded largely lower Friday, as the coronavirus pandemic continues to slow economic growth and oil demand.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Money managers rebalancing their portfolios to boost equity exposure into the end of the quarter may support the nascent stock rally that has followed the steep coronavirus-fueled market drop.
With the S&P 500 having lost around a third of its value in the recent selloff, investors may need to step up their equity purchases and sell bonds in order to maintain allocation targets. 
A portfolio that had stock allocations at 60% and bond allocations at 40% in mid-February may now be more evenly split between the two asset classes, facilitating the need for some investors to shift exposure toward stocks. 
""Given the many trillions of dollars in assets that follow some sort of multi-asset class approach, the coming rebalance could well be in the range of a few hundred billion,"" Jurrien Timmer, director of global macro in Fidelity's global asset allocation division, wrote in a note to clients this week. 
Funds can raise stock allocations in several ways, including selling bonds to buy stocks, using the cash in their portfolios or putting fresh money toward equities, said Leo Acheson, director of multi-asset ratings at Morningstar.
From speaking with portfolio managers, Acheson said many have not been waiting for quarter-end to make adjustments and instead are revisiting their portfolios daily and adjusting the split between equities and bonds to maintain their desired risk exposure.
""As managers rebalance and reallocate toward equities to get back toward their strategic weights ... that would be a support for equities,” he said.
U.S. stocks have bounced more than 17% from their lows this week following unprecedented stimulus measures from the Federal Reserve and U.S. Senate passage of a $2 trillion bill aimed at helping unemployed workers and industries hurt by the coronavirus pandemic. Few believe the volatility in markets has ended, as the outbreak's trajectory remains uncertain and the economic fallout potentially massive. 
Still, the Fed's pledge to buy billions of dollars worth of bonds, including $75 billion in U.S. Treasury securities a day this week, may be a boon to those looking to rebalance.
""You are buying equities at significantly lower prices than they were and you are selling bonds that are being artificially bid up by the Federal Reserve,"" said Michael O'Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading in Stamford, Connecticut.
The flows generated by rebalancing appear to have a noticeable impact on asset prices, especially when bond performance trounces that of equities, as has occurred so far in March.
On average, the S&P 500 has climbed nearly 7% over the final five days of a month in which bonds outperformed stocks by at least 10% during the month’s first few weeks, according to Christopher Murphy, co-head of derivatives strategy at Susquehanna Financial Group, citing eight such previous occurrences in data back to 1990.
The iShares Core US Aggregate Bond ETF (P:AGG) has fallen just 1% so far in March, against an 11% slide in the S&P 500 (SPX), as of Thursday, though that performance gap narrowed this week.
Pensions, endowments and foundations - overseeing as much as $15 trillion in assets - are among those that often look to adjust their portfolios around quarter end, said Steve Foresti, chief investment officer at Wilshire Consulting.

""All else equal, these institutions are fairly significantly under their target weight to equities, meaning they need to purchase to get back to their target,"" Foresti said. ""There is no question there is some natural buying and selling around those rebalancing activities.""

406,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 27, 2020 07:00AM ET</span>","U.S. airlines to dash for cash grants, not loans, even with potential government stake","By Tracy Rucinski and David Shepardson
CHICAGO/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. airlines are preparing to tap the government for up to $25 billion in grants to cover payroll in a sharp travel downturn triggered by the coronavirus, even after the government warned it may take stakes in exchange for bailout funds, people familiar with the matter said.
After the U.S. House of Representatives approves the airline bailout and President Donald Trump signs it as early as Friday, airlines are to receive initial payments within 10 days.
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin can demand equity, warrants or other financial instruments in order to ""provide appropriate compensation to the federal government."" A Treasury spokeswoman declined to comment on a report that Mnuchin would demand equity.
Airlines can ask for the equivalent of their payroll between April 1 and Sept. 30 of last year, according to the terms of the bill, meaning some large airlines could get $4 billion or more in total.
Delta Air Lines (N:DAL), for example, paid roughly $5.6 billion in salaries and related costs over the last six months of 2019 to around 91,000 full-time employees, according to regulatory filings.
Despite the prospects of payroll grants, airlines including Delta have already moved to reduce employee costs through temporary voluntary unpaid leave and early retirements.
More than 17,000 Delta workers such as flight attendants have already volunteered for unpaid leave for 30, 60 or 90 days, and Chief Executive Ed Bastian has asked employees to work only three or four days a week between April and June to save around 25% in payroll costs, according to a memo seen by Reuters.
With operations sharply cut back, airlines' biggest expense right now is employee wages and the government grants give them around six months to reassess whether air travel demand is really returning.
In a company memo on Thursday,  American Airlines Group  Inc's (O:AAL) leaders said they were extending voluntary leave options to non-union employees after negotiating agreements with groups representing union jobs such as pilots and flight attendants. 
""We are hopeful the uptake will be robust and are working hard to make sure all have the ability to continue employment, even if at reduced levels, while this crisis runs its course,"" Chief Executive Doug Parker and President Robert Isom told their employees.
American had around 133,000 full-time employees in 2019, about 85% of whom were unionized. Executives at American and Delta are also forgoing or cutting their pay.
Aside from the grants, airlines without other available financing options can also apply for $25 billion in loans and loan guarantees under the rescue package.
Some major airlines, which continued to tap debt markets this week while lobbying Washington for aid, have told U.S. officials they may skip the government loans entirely, people familiar with the discussions said.
The 5-year government loans would carry tougher terms than grants or loans from private banks, and could burden balance sheets just as companies are trying to recover from the crisis.
""However, if demand trends don't improve during the second half of 2020, we would not be surprised if some of the carriers began to express an interest in the loan program,""  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) analyst Michael Linenburg said in a note. 
If they do, companies would have to restrict executive compensation and suspend dividend payments until 12 months after loan re-payment.
With the grants, limits on executive compensation would expire on March 24, 2022, and dividends and share buybacks can resume on Sept. 30, 2021. 

Between loans and grants, American would be eligible for $12 billion, Parker said on Thursday. Despite uncertainty over exact funding conditions, he said he was ""optimistic that the terms will not be onerous.""

TOKYO/LAUSANNE (Reuters) - Officials in charge of staging Tokyo's Olympic Games crowded around a low table inside Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's residence late Tuesday, wincing as they spoke by phone with the head of the International Olympic Committee (IOC).
Minutes later, Abe emerged to inform a gaggle of reporters that he had just spoken with Thomas Bach, the IOC's president, and that they had agreed to officially delay the Tokyo Olympics.
The evening call between Abe and Bach concluded days and weeks of negotiations between Tokyo and Lausanne, where the IOC is based, and came after repeated public denials by Japanese officials that a pandemic might derail the Games.
Through interviews with more than a dozen people involved in the process over recent weeks, Reuters has pieced together an account of the frenetic days that led to Tuesday's announcement. 
It was an extraordinary turnaround for an Olympics that was expected to be held without major issues by a country known for public safety and economic stability. It also revealed a fatal miscalculation by Japanese and IOC officials of public sentiment at a time of heightened fears over the coronavirus.
In the days leading up to the decision, organizers of the Games were under pressure from major players in global sports: sponsors wanting updates on event plans, powerful sports federations worried about athlete safety, and Japanese officials seeking to maintain a united front to support the 2020 Games. 
But ultimately, it was the growing chorus of concerns from famous athletes and nations under lockdown that sunk Tokyo's hopes to hold the Olympics as planned in July, according to senior officials at the IOC and on Tokyo's organizing committee. 
Japan's government did not respond to an emailed request for comment. 
BREWING TROUBLE
The first inkling of trouble came in February as the coronavirus began to spread outside of China, where it emerged late last year.
When asked on Feb 14 about the rising number of cases in China, John Coates, a member of the IOC's Coordination Commission for Tokyo, brushed off questions from reporters about contingency plans, saying the country had been able to monitor its athletes ""since day one"". Most of them had been preparing for the Games overseas and would therefore not need to be quarantined on arrival in Japan, he said.
A few weeks later, after Abe had taken the unprecedented step of closing schools across the country, Yoshiro Mori, the head of the 2020 organizing committee, spoke in unusually blunt terms when asked by a reporter about making changes to the Olympic schedule. 
""I'm not God so I don't know,"" he said on March 4. 
But behind the scenes in early March, government and central bank officials in Japan were already weighing the risk of cancellation as they drafted projections for this year's economic outlook, sources with direct knowledge of the matter said.
Japanese corporate sponsors who had spent a record $3 billion to participate in the Olympics were also growing increasingly anxious as the number of virus cases ticked upward, according to multiple sources at various companies. 
Those corporations, already holding regular meetings with organizers to discuss the evolving situation, privately voiced concern about flip-flopping public messages coming from officials, representatives from half a dozen sponsors said. 
Various sponsors involved in the talks felt hamstrung in the chaotic situation, saying they had not been given assurances about what would happen to funds they had contributed to the Olympics if there was a cancellation or postponement, they said.
""We've already spent a lot of money on Olympics-related marketing campaigns and pre-Games events, and we are not going to get the money back,"" said one source at a major Japanese sponsor. She said employees involved in the event were ""floored"" upon hearing Abe's remarks. 
A representative at another Japanese sponsor said they still had not heard specifics about the delayed Games.
Another official at a top-tier Japanese sponsor said it seemed as if decisions were being made in ""a black box"". 
In an emailed response to Reuters' questions, Tokyo 2020 organizers said they were unable to disclose details of individual contracts with sponsors for confidentiality reasons. 
""We are reviewing all individual aspects of the postponement of the Games and will announce information as soon as possible,"" the committee said. 
TIDE TURNS ON OLYMPICS 
On March 16, Abe held a video conference with leaders from the Group of Seven nations and used it to lay the groundwork for a postponement of the Olympics, a government source close to Abe said. 
Abe had already spoken to U.S. President Donald Trump after the American leader referred to a one-year postponement.
By that time, Japanese Olympic officials had realized the event could not go on as planned in July, but they could not talk about it publicly, a senior official at the organizing committee told Reuters.
Two days after the G7 call, it was announced that the deputy head of the Japanese Olympic Committee tested positive for the coronavirus. 
Kozo Tashima, who also heads the country's football association, attended a meeting with Mori and other influential leaders of Tokyo 2020 a week prior. 
""It was definitely the moment it all became real for us,"" a Japanese national committee official said. 
By mid-March, the number of deaths caused by the coronavirus had more than quadrupled to 7,980 worldwide from a month prior. The death toll is now over 22,000.
Meanwhile in Lausanne, sources familiar with deliberations within the IOC said Bach and other officials had underestimated the tide of public opinion turning against the event.
When asked for comment from Bach, the IOC's press office did not respond to specific questions and directed Reuters to a transcript of a recent conference call in which he said that the decision to postpone the Games was based on ""the developments with the dynamic spreading of the coronavirus"".
The IOC asked various national Olympic committees over the weekend to open up training centers so their athletes could prepare for Tokyo, the sources in Lausanne said, even as countries like Germany and Spain were sealing borders and ordering large-scale lockdowns.
Representatives from some of the countries had tried explaining to Bach how it wasn't possible for their athletes to train, citing travel restrictions and curfews, they said. 
""But Bach was only thinking about holding the Games in July as planned,"" one of those sources said. 
Bach, who was a lawyer by profession before ascending to the top IOC position in 2013, told The New York Times on March 19 that the Olympics were four and a half months away, and that speculation on alternate plans was ""premature"".
But on Sunday, the sources said the IOC called an emergency meeting of its executive board after more athletes began voicing health concerns. 
The IOC initially hoped the board meeting might ""buy it a bit more time,"" one of the sources said. 
A Canadian IOC member, Dick Pound, said Tokyo and the Olympic committee weren't ready to make the decision until they saw the ""logarithmic increase"" in cases in the United States and elsewhere, which contrasted with more settled conditions in Japan and China.
""I think they eventually realized that even if Japan was under control the rest of the world was not,"" he said.
It became clear that athletes were not able to properly train, especially in team and combat sports in which establishing ""safe distance"" is difficult, Pound said. 
THE UNRAVELING
Tokyo 2020 was unraveling quickly. 
Reiko Chinen, who oversees preparations for weightlifting at the 2020 games, said that pressure was mounting on Tokyo to make a decision as countries like Canada and Australia started dropping out.
The Olympic torch had already arrived in Japan and was being taken around areas of Japan struck by the tsunami and earthquake in 2011, when Nahomi Kawasumi, a well-known women's soccer player selected to run in the relay, pulled out.
A senior organizing committee official said he knew a delay was inevitable.
""We had to keep preparing for the torch relay because if we had canceled it, then it would be clear that we intended to delay the Olympics,"" he said.
Then came Tuesday night. One by one, black sedans carrying the leaders of Tokyo 2020 arrived at the prime minister's private residence. 
Behind closed doors, a deal was underway. 
An hour before Abe was set to speak with Bach, IOC's Coates and the chief executive of Tokyo 2020, Toshiro Muto, convened a conference call, a senior organizing committee official said. 
""The premier's wishes for a delay of about a year was communicated to Coates and both sides confirmed that they wanted the same outcome,"" the official said.
Soon after, the two leaders sealed the deal.
A day later, the Olympic clock installed outside Tokyo Station stopped counting down the days and minutes until the Summer Games.
It now displays the day's date and time, just like any other clock in the city.

411,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 27, 2020 06:30AM ET</span>",Coronavirus delays Royal Mail 'Journey 2024' turnaround plan,"By Muvija M
(Reuters) - Britain's  Royal Mail  (L:RMG) on Friday became the latest company to say the coronavirus had delayed plans for a radical turnaround and also canceled its dividend and suspended financial forecasts for the next year.
The former monopoly and one of the world's oldest postal companies last May pledged to invest 1.8 billion pounds ($2.19 billion) to transform itself into a sustainable, profitable operation by 2024. It has since been locked in negotiations with its labor union.
""Uncertainty around the length and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, means we now believe it will take longer than expected to achieve the targets laid out in our Journey 2024 plan,"" the company said in a statement.
It was too early to predict accurately the financial impact from the virus-related disruptions, but it said it expected its British business to be loss-making in the financial year 2020-21 and business-to-business volumes to continue to decline.
Shares in Royal Mail were down 8.4% at 148 pence by 1003 GMT.
The company, which provides letter and parcel deliveries to more than 30 million businesses and households, said it cannot rule out scaling back its services as the situation develops.
It also said volumes of advertising mail had fallen heavily since the outbreak and its international operations have seen lower volumes following restrictions in many countries, especially China, where the coronavirus began in December.
Its parcels business, however, has experienced increased activity over the last two weeks, as more people shop online to avoid public spaces because of their fear of infection. 
The Royal Mail's announcement follows similar news from other major companies.
The banking group HSBC (L:HSBA) is delaying the ""vast majority"" of its planned redundancies to deal with the fallout from the coronavirus, a memo to staff seen by Reuters said.
Britain's BBC has also suspended plans to cut 450 jobs as it faces the demands of delivering news on the outbreak.
Following guidance from the Financial Conduct Authority and Financial Reporting Council to British companies, the Royal Mail said it will postpone its fiscal 2019-20 results, which had been scheduled for May 21.
The company has more than 800 million pounds ($973.76 million) in cash as well as a 925 million pounds credit facility.

Diess told the Markus Lanz talkshow that the German company, which employs 671,000 people worldwide, was not making any sales outside China and was looking for ways to resume production elsewhere that wouldn't endanger its staff.
""We need to rethink production. The discipline which we had in China we do not yet have at our German locations,"" he said.
""Only if we, like China, Korea or other Asian states, get the problem under control then we have a chance to come through the crisis without job losses. It requires a very sharp intervention,"" Diess said.
Demand in China is picking up again but production is only at half the level prior to the crisis, he said.
Volkswagen, the world's biggest automaker by vehicle sales, has 124 factories around the world of which 72 are in Europe, with 28 in Germany alone. It suspended production in Europe earlier this month because of the pandemic.
Volkswagen was working on ways to resume manufacturing with workers maintaining safe distances from one another, including by stepping up hygiene and disinfecting, Diess said.
""We are not making sales or revenues outside of China,"" Diess, adding that Volkswagen still had to cover a high level of fixed costs of ""around 2 billion euros a week"", he told ZDF late on Thursday.
The carmaker, which owns the Audi (DE:NSUG), Bentley, Bugatti, Lamborghini, Porsche, Seat and Skoda brands, sold 10.96 vehicles last year. It also makes Ducati motorbikes as well as MAN (DE:MANG) and Scania trucks.
PRESSURE ON REFINANCING
VW's Chief Financial Officer Frank Witter called on the European Central Bank (ECB) to accelerate purchases of short-term debt, the Financial Times reported on Friday.
He said the ECB should send ""clear signals"" and purchase the short-term debt, which often matures in as little as six or nine months, ""as soon as possible"". (https:// The ECB said last week it would prop up markets, including through the purchase of commercial paper, as part of a 750 billion euro plan to boost asset purchases to contain the financial fallout from coronavirus.  It remains unclear whether the ECB has started buying commercial paper. VW is one of Europe's most regular corporate issuers of commercial paper.  ""There's a lot of pressure on the incoming money flow,"" said Witter. ""We have different diversified funding sources available but not all of them are as liquid as they were."" VW has the capacity to issue up to 15 billon euros of commercial paper under its main funding programme, with another 5 billion euros earmarked for short-term debt in Belgium. Its ringfenced financial services division has a separate commercial paper programme with a 2.5 billion euro limit. Witter said Volkswagen, which has yet to tap bank credit lines worth in excess of 20 billion euros, considered those facilities only as a back-up for when capital markets are shut. In a separate interview with German paper Boersen-Zeitung, Witter said Volkswagen did not see the need to tap state aid to weather the crisis.  Passenger car sales were down 40% in March, Witter told the newspaper, adding that the company was reviewing whether its annual general meeting could take place on May 7. For now, Volkswagen is sticking to its forecast of paying a dividend but it was looking closely at all investment and spending needs, Witter told Boersen-Zeitung.  A VW spokesman confirmed the remarks made to the papers.

MUMBAI/SEOUL (Reuters) - Crashing markets are driving the biggest rush from Asian retail investors into stocks in a decade or more, brokers say, as bargain-hunting and a fear of missing out prompts a scramble to ""buy the dip"".
Even as global coronavirus infections and deaths continue to mount and more companies issue profit warnings, stockbroker switchboards from Sydney to Singapore have lit up with calls from erstwhile punters wanting to invest.
Indian brokerages say they have never signed on so many new customers so quickly, while deposits at their South Korean peers have jumped to a record high as investors hunt for bargains after a $12 trillion wipeout in world stocks.
""If people were waiting for a pullback, well they got it and then some,"" said Chris Brankin, chief executive at brokerage TD Ameritrade in Singapore, where a 50% monthly jump in new accounts was the best since setting up there nine years ago.
""The one thing that has been difficult for us, is that as soon as people register for an account, they say 'Can I trade now?' I'm like...it's a couple-day process to be able to get the account open and then get money into it."" 
Driving the interest has been wall-to-wall coverage of both the coronavirus crisis and a plunge in global markets.
About a fifth of the value of world stocks has been lost in the past six weeks and no asset class has been spared. Many small investors seem to feel this is an unrivalled opportunity - particularly as markets have rallied hard in the last few days.
Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) searches for the bargain-hunter's catchcry, ""buy the dip,"" hit an all-time high on Wednesday, Google Trends data shows.
And where Asian indexes have fallen the furthest, interest from mum-and-pop investors has jumped the most as they deploy long-held savings or draw down loans to buy shares.
In India, brokerage Zerodha has already opened a record 140,000 new accounts this month - double the average. The S&P Sensex index's (BSESN) 30% drop since January makes it one of the world's worst performing markets. 
CommSec, Australia's largest retail broker, said account openings had increased fourfold in March. Brokers in Manila, Hong Kong, Bangkok, Tokyo, Kuala Lumpur and Jakarta reported surges as well.
In Korea, where the benchmark Kospi (KS11) is down by a quarter since January, retail investors lifted their broker deposits 53% to a record 41 trillion won ($34 billion).
""This is the best opportunity I have seen in 10 years to get into stocks,"" said Cho Hyun-suk, a 40-year old office worker in Seoul, who had been steering clear of the market since the global financial crisis.
""I was a fresh graduate when many of the mutual funds just halved in value, too many. I plan to make a big investment with my seed money I have been saving up, at the right timing,"" she said, without disclosing the size of her planned purchases.
Investors have looked to previous crises for clues on a rebound.
After the 2002-2003 SARS outbreak, which was mostly confined to Asia and hit Asia's markets hardest - the rebound was sharp. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index (HSI) dropped 18% in about four months, then surged by almost a third in the second half of 2003. The decline in the 2008/2009 financial crisis and the recovery both took much longer. The MSCI All-Country index (MIWD00000PUS) lost 56% over 10 months, with plenty of false dawns along the way. It was nearly five-and-a-half years before it regained 2008 levels.
Falls over the past few weeks, though, have outpaced even Wall Street's 1929 crash.
The breadth and scale of the lockdowns and business closures across the globe are also unprecedented, prompting governments to pump in trillions of dollars in support and central banks to slash interest rates, fuelling the supply of cheap cash.
NO WARREN BUFFETS
It is less clear what exactly these investors are doing with their money, though blue chips at home and abroad are common themes.
In China, where the number of stock trading accounts rose nearly 12% through February, inflows have swamped funds that facilitate international investment.
Moleonoto The, CEO of Indonesian brokerage IndoPremier, said some clients who usually invested through mutual funds now want to buy big-cap stocks directly.
TD Ameritrade's Brankin said many Asian investors were hoping the hardest-hit travel and energy sectors may have hit bottom. Cruise line Carnival Corp (N:CCL), down 65% this year, has become one of the most popular buys.
Others though, were speculative, or seeking to hedge pension fund investments by making bets on further market falls.
""It is not Warren Buffet style buy and hold investing - it is short term,"" said Louis Tse, managing director at Hong Kong based VC Asset Management, which also offers brokerage services.
It is also risky against a backdrop of increasingly dire news about the pandemic and a global recession analysts say is all but certain.
More than 24,000 people have died from the virus so far, three million people filed jobless claims in the United States last week and professional investors caution against calling the end of a bear market.
""It's absolutely impossible to know when the bottom has been reached - ever,"" said Oaktree Capital Management founder Howard Marks in a note to investors last week.
""I believe this is a good time to invest, although of course it may prove not to have been the best time.""

Investing.com -- For weeks, the property-obsessed British public has been accused of not taking the Covid-19 seriously enough. It will now.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson late on Thursday to effectively suspend the nation’s housing market, due to the pandemic, and that has put shares in the country’s estate agents and housebuilders under particular pressure on Friday.
The move is rational enough – viewings of properties and the whole business of removals pose a clear and present danger of accelerating transmission of the disease, especially when those carrying it can remain without symptoms for weeks.
But it will extend the ‘sudden stop’ of business to builders and their suppliers, to banks who depend heavily on mortgage lending and the commissions it generates, to estate agents and to insurance companies.
By 6:15 AM ET (1015 GMT),  Persimmon  (LON:PSN) shares were down 8.2% and Redrow  (LON:RDW) shares were down 7.1%, the latter after an announcement that it will close all its building sites and sales offices for the foreseeable future.  Taylor Wimpey  (LON:TW) shares and  Barratt Developments  (LON:BDEV) shares were down 4.2% and 4.1% respectively.
Things were no better for the estate agents, with online specialist Rightmove shares losing 6.3%.
The broader FTSE 100 and FTSE 250 indices were down 4.0% and 3.4%, respectively, while the benchmark Stoxx 600 was down 2.7% on some profit-taking after a record-breaking week.
The standout performer was Berkeley Group (LON:BKGH), which concentrates on upper-market construction in London and the south of England. In contrast to many, it said it will pay its dividend for the year ending next week as planned and also reiterated its intention to pay out another 140 million pounds to shareholders through dividends and buybacks by September. Berkeley shares were down only 1.4%
That’s a stark contrast to the succession of cash conservation measures announced by others – not just in the housing sector – over the last two weeks. Berkeley will still have over 1 billion pounds of net cash after the full-year dividend payment and total accessible liquidity of 1.75 billion pounds.
Another relative outperformer in the sector was Countrywide, although its 1.6% bounce was of the dead-cat variety. Countrywide shares have fallen 79% in the last month after LSL abandoned its intention to buy the company and a separate proposed sale of its commercial property arm also fell through."

BOSTON (Reuters) - Talks between First United Corp and Driver Management to settle a fight for board seats at the bank holding company broke down when the activist investor rejected the offer, two sources familiar with the matter said on Thursday.
""Your 'best and final' offer failed to meet what I clearly described as the minimum acceptable conditions for any cooperation agreement,"" Driver Management founder Abbott Cooper wrote in a letter to the board's lead director and seen by Reuters. ""I think it is appropriate to suspend those discussions.""
They two sides now appear headed for a showdown at a time a number of companies have pushed to settle with activists amid the panic selling that battered their stock prices as the coronavirus has spread.
First United, the holding company for Maryland community bank First United Bank & Trust, said it was offering Driver a say in picking more than a quarter of its 11-member board, including two independent directors who would be appointed before this year's annual meeting.
Driver, which owns roughly 5% of the company, would pick one director from the company's nominees and the company would pick one of Driver's proposed candidates, according to First United's proposal.
A third independent director would be named before next year's meeting. Each of the new directors designated by Driver would be given a committee assignment.
Driver has for months been pushing the company to sell itself, saying it has fallen behind peers in making new loans. In September, Driver forecast the company could be sold for between $26 and $33 a share. It traded at $12.88 on Thursday.
Driver this week criticized the company for missteps during the 2008 financial crisis and said it was poorly positioned for the current downturn. Cooper, Driver's founder, said he wants two people to hold the positions of chief executive and board chairman, both currently held by CEO Carissa Rodeheaver.
And he said he would like a full board refreshment to eliminate directors who have served more than 10 years.
Driver nominated three directors last year.
Since September the fight has heated up with barbs often directed at the board and Rodeheaver, lawyers and bankers said.
Cooper previously wrote to the lead independent director that they could speak by phone. But ""spare me the false indignation and just get to business,"" Cooper's letter said.

416,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 27, 2020 06:10AM ET</span>",European banks should halt 2020 dividends due to epidemic: trade body,"By Huw Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - Banks should halt 2020 dividend payments to preserve capital and keep lending to businesses and households until the impact of the coronavirus epidemic is clearer, the European Banking Federation (EBF) said.
The EBF said the European banking sector remained ""fully committed"" to helping businesses and households cope with the fallout from the health crisis and it would prioritize solvency in order to be able to fund the economy.
Most banks acknowledge paying 2020 dividends may be unlikely. However many are wary of pulling payouts for 2019 they had already told investors would be coming, setting up a potential battle if governments try to push them to. 
""It is the strong view of the European Banking Federation that any decisions by a listed bank to withhold its 2019 dividends at this stage needs to take into account the perception of investors about the solvency of the European banking sector and the expectations of shareholders,"" the EBF said in a letter sent to the European Central Bank's top banking regulator Andrea Enria late on Thursday.
""Banks should be prudent when deciding about dividends and have a forward-looking view on risks to avoid a situation where capital needs would arise,"" an ECB spokeswoman said on Friday.
The EBF, a trade body which represents banks across Europe, said that where 2019 dividend distributions and share buybacks have not yet been voted by shareholders, some banks could decide to put part or all the amount into reserves until the impact of coronavirus is clearer. 
""For 2020 the EBF believes that listed banks should not accrue dividends or undertake share buybacks so as to maintain maximum capital preservation and bank boards will be deciding on dividend policy and any distribution amounts at year-end,"" the EBF said.
Germany's Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) said it was considering its 2019 dividend. ""We are looking at it and will decide responsibly,"" it said. Germany's  Aareal Bank  (DE:ARLG) is also considering its dividend.
In Spain, Caixabank (MC:CABK) is cutting its dividend, while Santander (MC:SAN) has said it would hold off paying its interim dividend, due in November.
The ECB is allowing banks to tap some of their capital to ensure they keep lending during the epidemic and has said they should not use it to increase dividends or bonuses.
The French government on Friday called on companies in which the state has a stake not to pay dividends as they deal with the coronavirus crisis.

BEIJING (Reuters) - China's auto industry has gone from zero to sixty in its post-pandemic campaign drive, with manufacturers and dealers quick to woo back lockdown-weary consumers through campaigns as unusual as a makeup-promoting personality touting car leasing.
Social media celebrity Lipstick King urged millions of fans on a live-streamed shopping show to sign up to a lease deal for General Motors Co's (N:GM) Cadillac CT4 compact sedan.
""This color has the sense of 'I'm in charge' independence,"" he said, displaying a scale model of a chocolate-colored car.
The plug is just one part of an eruption of promotional campaigns featuring steep discounts, cold-calling and gimmicks, from an industry obliterated by government restrictions on movement imposed in January to curb the spread of a virus which in China has infected 81,000 people and caused 3,300 deaths.
The economy shrank 21% in January-February with sales in the world's biggest vehicle market last month plunging 79%. Retail sales of passenger cars dropped 45% in the first three weeks of March, and the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers does not expect demand to normalize until the third quarter.
With authorities gradually easing restrictions, automakers and dealers have started the engines on their promotional machinery to undo what consulting firm IHS Markit described as an ""unprecedented and almost instant stalling of demand"".
U.S. electric vehicle (EV) maker Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) has launched test-drive and delivery services involving no staff contact, while Zhejiang Geely Holding Group Co Ltd is delivering disinfected cars and dropping off keys with drones.
The EV unit of Guangzhou Automobile Group Co Ltd (SS:601238) is even testing a system to perfume its Aion LX SUV with the aroma of traditional Chinese medicine.

FREE MASKS
SAIC-GM-Wuling (SGMW) - a venture between SAIC Motor Corp Ltd (SS:600104), U.S. maker GM and a local partner - on Feb. 25 started offering up to 11,000 yuan off purchases of its Wuling and Baojun brand vehicles, until the total discounts given reach 1 billion yuan ($141.69 million). Buyers also get medical masks.
Seeing the promotion, restaurateur Wang Zhiyuan, 37, visited an SGMW dealership in Beijing earlier this month and received a 2,000 yuan discount on a Wuling Hongguang commercial minivan.
Family sauna equipment supplier Mo Xiufeng, 40, was at the same dealership viewing the same vehicle to make a purchase he had been chewing over since before the lockdown.
""I haven't been able to come in the meantime because, fearing the virus, I didn't want to leave my home,"" he said.
The dealership sold just 20 vehicles in February. It targets March sales of 100, versus an average of 500 before the virus.
Due to the campaign, SGMW's nationwide is a picture of even quicker recovery. A spokeswoman said March registered at least five days of sales surpassing 5,000 vehicles, with one day reaching 6,000, exceeding last year's daily average. At the beginning of February, sales were around 200.
NO INVENTORY
Still, industry bodies have called for government help including purchase tax cuts on small vehicles, support for sales in rural areas and eased emission rules. The China Automobile Dealers Association has lobbied for loans to dealerships and temporary liquidity support such as credit lines.
Local authorities in cities that rely heavily on vehicle manufacturing, such as Guangzhou in the south and Ningbo in the east, have also started to offer purchase incentives.
Visits to showrooms by a Reuters reporter and telephone interviews with 50 dealerships across China indicate the campaigns are indeed bringing shoppers back.
A Beijing dealership for a joint venture between  Dongfeng Motor Group  Co Ltd (HK:0489) and Japan's Honda Motor Co Ltd (T:7267), however, has a problem beyond footfall that is likely to leave March sales in ""single digits"" versus the usual 100.
""The problem now is we don't have enough cars in inventory,"" the sales manager told Reuters.
Dongfeng Honda is based in the city of Wuhan where the virus was first reported at the end of last year, and where business activity has been restricted for two months. A Honda spokesman said production at the venture was gradually increasing.
""The manufacturer said new cars would not arrive until mid-April,"" the sales manager said, standing in a deserted showroom.

Ferrari this month closed factories in Maranello and Modena, in the northern Italian region of Emilia-Romagna, for two weeks until March 27 in a response to the coronavirus outbreak and a shortage of parts.
Investment firm Exor (MI:EXOR), which controls Ferrari, on Wednesday said that current plant closures at Ferrari as well as at other controlled companies  Fiat  Chrysler (MI:FCHA) and  CNH Industrial  (MI:CNHI), though temporary, might continue.
Ferrari - which cited ""the huge uncertainty and lack of predictability that the COVID-19 has created"" - said it would continue to cover all days of absence for those employees who could not work remotely.
The company added it would give further financial guidance during a conference call on its first-quarter earnings, scheduled for May 4.
In February, Ferrari said it planned its adjusted core profit to increase to between 1.38-1.43 billion euros this year, compared to a previous guidance of over 1.3 billion euros.
Ferrari said on Friday it remained confident that it would ""continue to create value for all stakeholders beyond the near-term uncertainties"".

Investing.com - European stock markets traded lower Friday, with investors taking stock after recent hefty gains and as the coronavirus pandemic continues to reap damage throughout the region. 
At 04:10 ET (0510 GMT), the U.K.'s FTSE index was trading 3.9% lower, France's CAC 40 was down 3.0%, while the DAX fell 1.9%. The broader based Stoxx 600 Europe index dropped 2.5%.  
The benchmark Stoxx 600 index has recovered almost 17% since hitting a low on March 16, but still remains more than 26% below its all-time high last month.
The number of Covid-19 infections have continued to mount worldwide, to well above 500,000, but the news from Italy, the epicenter of the outbreak in Europe, has been disappointing as infections surged Thursday by 6,153, the most in five days.
Recent numbers from the northern region of Lombardy suggested the epidemic might be slowing in this key area. But poorer southern parts are now seeing a sharp rise in deaths, raising fears the health service there could be overwhelmed.
The news in Spain isn’t much better, while Germany is feeling the impact of the pandemic with cases rising Friday by 5,780, compared with the previous day.
In corporate news, online property portal  Rightmove  (LON:RMV)said Friday that it will cancel its proposed final dividend for 2019 and suspend its financial guidance, due to the uncertainty surrounding the coronavirus pandemic. Rightmove shares dropped by 5.9%. The U.K. government intervened to effectively suspend the whole U.K. housing market on Thursday evening.
Shares in SSE (LON:SSE) also fell 4.7% as the energy company reaffirmed its dividend guidance for fiscal 2020, but added that it expects adjusted earnings at the lower end of its previous guided range.
There is little economic data of note due in Europe Friday, but market participants could look to the release of the University of Michigan’s March consumer confidence number, at 10:00 AM ET (14:00 GMT), for guidance.
The March consumer sentiment index is expected to drop to 90 from the preliminary measure of 95.9, according to economists’ forecasts compiled by Investing.com. 
Investors will also be keeping a wary eye on the passage of the $2 trillion U.S. stimulus package through the House of Representatives Friday.
Oil has rebounded to a degree Friday, with gains in the U.S. contract, helped by the idea of additional stimulus in order to support demand as the coronavirus pandemic continues to slow economic growth.  However, newswires reported Russia's deputy energy minister as saying that a 'fair' price for oil was between $45-$55 a barrel, lower than the $60 level on which most European majors have based their planning in recent years.
At 5:10 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.9% higher at $22.81 a barrel. The international benchmark Brent contract fell 1.1% to $26.07.
Elsewhere, gold futures fell 1.9% to $1,620.70/oz, while EUR/USD traded at 1.1016, down 0.2% on the day.

424,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 27, 2020 04:27AM ET</span>","Virus Bill Set for Swift House Passage, But Stimulus May Be Slow","(Bloomberg) --The success of a massive stimulus package set for House passage on Friday will depend on how quickly the aid can get to beleaguered consumers and businesses -- a huge challenge for federal and state agencies that aren’t built to move quickly.
Congress has moved at a remarkable pace for such an enormous piece of legislation. The Senate unanimously approved the $2 trillion package of loans, aid and payments Wednesday night, and House is expected to quickly pass the bill Friday.
“We’ll have a strong bipartisan vote and hopefully by noon be finished,” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in an interview Thursday on Bloomberg Television. That will send the bill to President Donald Trump for his signature.
Then the hard work begins. Government institutions, especially the Treasury, will be asked to deliver enormous amounts of aid, racing against skyrocketing jobless claims.
Investors reacted positively to the action in the Senate, even with Thursday’s report that 3.28 million Americans filed for unemployment last week. The S&P 500 closed near session highs Thursday, posting its first three-day rally since February. The Dow Jones Industrial Average saw its biggest three-day gain since 1931 -- and is now 21% above its March 23 trough.
Douglas Holtz-Eakin, who was on President George W. Bush’s economic team during the 2001 recession, said he’s “cautiously optimistic” about the impact of the coronavirus package, but it probably won’t prevent a dramatic drop in the economy.
“I hope it works. It’s designed sensibly on paper. Now we have to get the money out the door,” Holtz-Eakin said. Even still, “we’re probably going to have a second quarter growth rate that is double-digit negative.”
It Takes Time
For pure scale, as well as speed, the virus rescue package dwarfs the stimulus plan President Barack Obama signed into law in February 2009 -- a roughly $800 billion package designed to last about two years and pull the country out of a deep recession triggered by the financial crisis.
It took time for that money to flow. Just $114 billion of the spending side of Obama’s package was spent by Sept. 30 of that year, according to the Congressional Budget Office.
By contrast, this plan is intended to deliver a larger and more compressed jolt to the economy until the crisis abates. New programs, like the $377 billion in fresh subsidies for small businesses, are intended to get out the door in weeks, not months or years, though it will be a challenge for the banking system and the government to quickly process the millions of transactions expected.
The biggest single portion of the stimulus is the billions earmarked for large companies and state and local governments. But the rules for deciding who will get that and how it will be distributed are a work in progress. The legislation specifies that 10 days after it becomes law, Treasury will publish guidelines on application requirements and how to get loans.
The Fed’s Role
Holtz-Eakin said Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin should let the Federal Reserve handle the entire corporate bailout. That would be the best way to distribute the aid according to need rather than based on political influence or popularity, said Holtz-Eakin, now president of the American Action Forum, a conservative issue advocacy group. The Fed is less likely to favor, for example, a coal mining company over a solar energy business.
The Fed already announced an initiative that provides a framework for backstopping bank loans to businesses, and the role mirrors actions it took in the 2008 financial crisis, Holtz-Eakin said.
“They have stood up everything they need, they are experienced at it, having done it in 2008-2009. People will come to the Fed out of need, who will then provide it to the people who need it the most,” he said. “The Treasury, in contrast, doesn’t lend to people. They borrow.”
Small businesses, which employ about half the private sector workforce, will be supported with a aid and federal loan guarantees going through banks and the Small Business Administration.
There is concern about whether the SBA can handle the strain of the demand and move quickly enough to deal with the urgency of the financial pressure facing many small businesses.
North Carolina Representative Patrick McHenry, the ranking Republican on the House Financial Service Committee, said the banking component is especially important because the SBA may not be able to move quickly enough.
“It is going to be a week to 10 days before they can access SBA programs,” McHenry said on Bloomberg Television. “Those community bankers will have greater capacity to work with people to structure their loans to get them through this cash crunch for the next month to three months that they are experiencing.”
Speed is Key
Mnuchin said he has authority to create regulations to allow FDIC-backed banks to give quick loan approvals.“By the end of next week we want all the banks to be able to originate loans same day,” Mnuchin said.
Speed is also key for millions of workers have lost jobs and are counting on unemployment insurance to cover housing costs, auto payments, student-debt payments, as well as other daily costs.
But that could be a choke point for the stimulus.
The record number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits last week was more than quadruple the previous high in 1982, according to Labor Department figures released Thursday. That is putting a heavy burden on state websites and other systems to process them.
The money available is significant. The stimulus bill provides funding to allow states to boost weekly unemployment benefits by $600 through July 31. Maximum state benefits range from $235 in Mississippi to $823 in Massachusetts depending on income. The added boost would be four months for those laid off now, but less time for those losing their jobs closer to July 31.
”We want people to take advantage of all of this quickly,” Pelosi said Thursday. Some of that will “depend on how the states do it, and they are not all uniform.”
‘Stressed Systems’
Seth Harris, who was deputy secretary of labor in the Obama administration, said the expanded coverage in the legislation, especially to contractors and those employed in the gig economy, may be a logistics challenge for some states.
“These under-resourced, strapped, stressed systems in many cases do not have the latest technology or data systems,” he said. “Now they’re being hit by the largest tsunami of unemployment claims in the history of those data being collected. Now Congress is asking them to change the way they do things.”
Andrew Stettner, a senior fellow with The Century Foundation and an expert on jobless benefits, said getting bigger checks to current unemployment recipients should be accomplished in a matter of weeks. Adding in new classes of workers like contractors may take longer.
“States are dealing with unprecedented volume and went into this crisis with very low staffing levels and more than half have ‘80s-era mainframe computers,” he said. “However, the fact that 3.2 million people were able to file a claim last week is evidence to their scalability.”
The House vote Friday will be conducted under unusual circumstances after two House members tested positive for the coronavirus, and others are in self-quarantine after possible exposure.
Leaders of both parties are working together to make sure enough members are in Washington Friday to constitute the quorum needed for a recorded vote -- which is at least 218 in the 435-seat chamber -- just in case there are objections raised on the floor to a voice vote.
Those lawmakers who make it back to the Capitol will vote in groups of 30 to maintain social distancing. The House’s sergeant at arms and attending physician urged members to avoid elevators, refrain from gathering in groups and to clean their hands before going into the chamber.

SEOUL (Reuters) - For  Samsung Electronics Co Ltd  (KS:005930), the 2020 Tokyo Olympics were going to be its springboard to attain a long-held goal - making significant inroads into Japan's lucrative smartphone market where Apple Inc (O:AAPL) dominates.
But after the Games were postponed to 2021 due to the coronavirus pandemic, the long-time sponsor's marketing plans - centered on its new S20 smartphone now out too early - have gone awry.
The delay may also mean the South Korean tech giant has lost a crucial window of opportunity. It had been expected to tout its 5G capability in its Olympics ads, aiming to attract a population excited to watch the Games with cutting-edge technology before Apple had a 5G product on the market.
""Samsung was keen to use the Olympics opportunity to get it right in Japan. In that sense, it's a bad situation,"" a person familiar with Samsung's operations told Reuters, noting that Samsung and other sponsors would have to adjust plans.
""A lot of the momentum for smartphone demand in the lead-up to the Olympics will also be gone,"" said the person, who was not authorized to speak on the matter and declined to be identified.
Former Samsung officials and analysts said Samsung will likely go back to the drawing board to promote a new flagship phone due out next year.
When asked about the impact of the Olympics postponement on its strategy for the Japan market, Samsung declined to comment, saying only it would continue to provide innovative technology for Japanese customers regardless of when the Games commence.
Samsung may be the world's No. 1 smartphone maker by volume but it has just a fraction of the Japanese market.
In contrast, Apple which first began selling the iPhone in Japan in 2008, gained share thanks to an aggressive advertising and pricing campaign from SoftBank (T:9984) - at the time its sole distributor. Japan has since become a loyal premium market and key profit center for the U.S. firm.
Apple currently commands 53% of the Japanese market, Sharp Corp (T:6753) has 12% and Sony Corp (T:6758) has 7%, according to Counterpoint Research. Samsung, which has lost ground since 2013, has 4%.
HARAJUKU HOPES 
Indicative of Samsung's struggles was its 2015 decision to drop its name from smartphones sold in Japan and just go with Galaxy branding - the only market where it does so. It's a move some analysts attribute to historical tensions that often flare up between South Korea and its neighbor. 
""I believe they did so due to the growing number of Japanese consumers who take political factors into account in their purchase considerations,"" said Shengtao Jin, a research analyst at Canalys. 
In its run at Apple's stronghold, Samsung had laid the groundwork for a concerted campaign.
In March last year, it opened the world's biggest Galaxy store in Harajuku, Tokyo's popular shopping district for youth fashion and pop culture. Boasting eight floors, the glitzy building has an exterior decorated with more than 1,000 smartphones. Samsung's mobile and network division chief Koh Dong-jin, officials from the International Olympic Committee and Tokyo 2020 organizers attended the opening ceremony to mark 500 days until the Games.
Then in May, Samsung's heir and de facto head, Jay. Y Lee traveled to Japan, meeting with executives from mobile carriers NTT DoCoMo Inc (T:9437) and KDDI Corp (T:9433) to discuss 5G cooperation.
DoCoMo and SoftBank Corp (T:9434), the domestic telecom arm of SoftBank Group, are currently rolling out 5G services. But the delay of the Games means 5G is not expected to gain momentum until Apple launches a 5G-capable iPhone, analysts said.
That phone is expected to arrive by end-2020, though some media reports have said it may be delayed by the pandemic.
""Samsung could have taken an early lead in 5G but the Games postponement is a setback,"" said Jeong Ok-hyun, a former LG mobile executive and a professor at Sogang University in Seoul.
""The virus could also lead to delays in the development of the 5G market, which will be a relief to Apple.""
For the time being, it remains to be seen if Samsung will proceed with plans to sell a special Olympics edition S20 phone with 5G capability. The phone to be sold by DoCoMo was due to be launched in June and Samsung began taking pre-orders this month.

Asked if the plan is on track, Samsung said details will be determined after discussions with the IOC and DoCoMo.

Leaders from the Group of 20 economies also pledged to pump $5 trillion into the world economy at a meeting Thursday.
European governments are also spending billions of euros trying to shore up their economies amid the coronavirus crisis, noted ING analyst Bert Colijn, in a research note, and “although there's little coordination between eurozone member states, the plans are similar and it's likely we'll see yet more financial pledges before this is over.”
The need for stimulus was amply illustrated with the release of the U.S. initial claims data Thursday, which showed the number of Americans applying for unemployment benefits surged to a record 3.28 million last week.
There’s little in the way of economic data due in Europe Friday, but investors could keep an eye on the University of Michigan’s March consumer confidence release, at 10:00 AM ET (14:00 GMT).

429,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 27, 2020 02:54AM ET</span>",Bull-Market Gain in Stocks Seen as Trivial Without Sustained Buying,"(Bloomberg) -- After meltdowns and lockdowns, some Asian equity markets are inching close to breaking out of bear territory. But the rebound doesn’t mean much without seeing sustained buying, market participants say.
Asian stocks rose again on Friday, following the U.S. higher after the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed out of its bear market overnight. The MSCI Asia Pacific index has risen 13% from its March low after losing about a third of its value from a record high in January. Benchmark gauges in the Philippines, South Korea and India have all advanced more than 15% from recent lows, drawing closer to a 20% gain defined as a bull market. Japan’s Topix closed at 18% above its March low on Friday.
“The 20% yardstick does not matter unless we start seeing higher highs and sustainable buying at lows,” said Jaiganesh Balasubramaniam, a market technician at Cashthechaos.com. “We need higher highs and higher lows on different time frames before we can say that we are out of bear markets.”
Balasubramaniam added that the S&P 500 Index has yet to mark a 20% gain from its recent trough so “investors should not go berserk about attaching bull market titles.”
Meanwhile, some investors have been hunting for bargains after historic drops in the region’s equities. The Asian gauge is set for its fourth straight day of gains amid unprecedented monetary and fiscal stimulus across the globe in a bid to contain the economic damage caused by the coronavirus pandemic.
Volatility, however, remains high, with the 10-day realized measure on the Asian equity benchmark still around the highest since data going back to 2010.
“It’s foolhardy to jump into a volatile market that has only risen for a few days after falling so heavily,” said Dale Gillham, chief analyst at Wealth Within. “It is very dangerous.”

The crisis has nearly shut down worldwide air travel and is destroying fuel demand, which could fall by 15% to 20% globally in coming months. 
The virus had not hit Latin America with the same intensity as Europe or the United States, but it is increasingly spreading there, and a growing number of nations are imposing travel restrictions. 
The region's largest importers in recent days began cutting orders of fuel cargoes, which are mostly executed on the volatile spot market, as consumption falls, according to sources at trading and refining firms. 
Latin America's two largest fuel importers, Petroleos Mexicanos and Brazil's Petrobras (SA:PETR4), have reduced the number of cargoes of gasoline and diesel to be imported in the coming weeks, according to traders. 
The United States exported 2.9 million barrels per day of fuel to Latin America and the Caribbean last year, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, making the region the largest buyer of American refined products, and a steady customer for U.S. refiners.
In Mexico, which bought 1.19 million bpd of fuel from the United States in 2019, retail demand contracted 15% in the last two weeks, according to its fuel sellers association, Onexpo, while prices began falling at gas stations. 
U.S. fuel exports to Latin America have been affected by a ""super lockdown,"" one refined products trader at a global merchant said. Another said exports have been hit as the ""world is stopping."" 
""Most opportunistic purchases motivated by falling prices have disappeared as the largest importers in the region don't have large capacity to store gasoline or diesel,"" said another trader. 
U.S. refiner Phillips 66 (N:PSX) on Tuesday said that some of its Latin American customers were asking if they could back out of purchases, which is one reason the company's refineries are working at reduced rates. 
Mexico's largest importer, Pemex, had already cut fuel imports by 14% in January to 733,600 bpd, according to official data. The state firm's fuel imports from the United States have also declined at the expense of new entrants such as ExxonMobil (N:XOM),  BP  (L:BP) and  Valero Energy  (N:VLO), said Michael Upchurch, chief financial officer at U.S. railroad company Kansas City Southern (N:KSU), an active shipper of fuels to Mexico.
In Brazil, the largest Latin American buyer of diesel, domestic fuel sales recently fell by an average of 50% in cities with more than 300,000 inhabitants, a union representing more than 40,000 gas stations said on Wednesday. Local Brazilian authorities are trying to restrict travel to combat the virus, even as President Jair Bolsonaro opposed shutdowns.
Venezuela, a regular importer of diluent naphtha, gasoline and diesel, has reduced purchases this month to about half, mainly due to U.S. sanctions limiting the suppliers that can work with state-run PDVSA, but also because of plummeting demand following gas station closures. 
In Colombia, state-controlled Ecopetrol (CN:ECO) noticed a fall in domestic fuel demand, which already motivated processing cuts at its Cartagena and Barrancabermeja refineries.

Pemex and PDVSA did not respond to requests for comment. Petrobras declined to comment.

432,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 27, 2020 02:35AM ET</span>","Mini-bull, tired bear, or something in-between","By Saqib Iqbal Ahmed and Noel Randewich
NEW YORK/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Investors could be forgiven for doing a double-take: Wait, we're back in a bull market? 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average's surge of over 20% from its coronavirus-induced recent low this week, by one definition used on Wall Street, suggests a new bull market. The surge came on hopes a $2 trillion stimulus measure would flood the country with cash in a bid to counter the economic impact of the intensifying pandemic.
But that definition should be treated with a large piece of caution. The very definition of bull market is debatable, and given the market's volatility on news about the pandemic, some said that calling the move upwards a ""bull market"" was tantamount to missing the forest for the trees.
""Labeling it a bull market when it fits a definition of being up 20% kind of removes any perspective from where we have been over the past month, and more importantly, where we might be going over the next few months,"" said Willie Delwiche, an investment strategist at Robert W. Baird.
Other definitions say the index should crest the previous high and that a bull market can only be identified a long time after the event.
For example, a mini-bull market has occurred previously during a bear market - providing a false hope of relief. The S&P 500 logged a gain of 24% over a period of 30 trading days starting on Nov. 20, 2008, even as the bear market continued during the height of the financial crisis, and the index did not bottom till March 9, 2009, marking the start of the bull market.
Ed Yardeni, president and chief investment strategist at Yardeni Research, said that while there is consensus about the definition of a bear market - a 20% decline from a peak - the definition of a bull market is less widely agreed upon.
""Bull markets occur between bear markets,"" Yardeni said.
Part of the confusion about whether the Dow is indeed out of the bear market is because while one group is widely recognized for determining U.S. economic cycles - the National Bureau of Economic Research - no such body is uniformly accepted for defining bull and bear markets.
(GRAPHIC: S&P 500 bear markets - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/3992/3948/Bear%20Markets.png)
Analysts warn against putting too much stock in strict definitions of market cycles. Factors like the velocity of the market’s rise or fall, how much average stocks have changed, and the reasons behind the moves also contribute to whether investors view a major move as a turning point in sentiment or a short-term interruption to an existing bull or bear market.
Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices in New York, said he still sees the Dow in a bear market. The Dow would need to hit 29,551.42, the high of Feb. 12, to be technically in a bull market, he said.

""If we keep going up, eventually we could have a bull, but until it hits the record, it's a bull run in a bear market,"" Silverblatt said.

433,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 27, 2020 01:50AM ET</span>",Asia shares rise on more stimulus hopes but dollar loses steam,"By Stanley White
TOKYO (Reuters) - Asian stocks rose on Friday as investors wagered policymakers will roll out more stimulus measures to combat the coronavirus pandemic after U.S. unemployment filings surged to a record.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.8%. Australian shares gave up gains to fall 4.55% after a strong week, but Japan's Nikkei rose 1.92%.
E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 reversed course and fell 1.58% in Asia following three consecutive days of gains in the S&P 500 on Wall Street.
Pan-regional Euro Stoxx 50 futures were down 1.41% , German DAX futures fell 1.38%, and FTSE futures were down 2.21% , suggesting gains in Asian shares will not carry over into Europe.
The dollar fell against major currencies as central banks' steps to solve a dollar shortage in funding markets started to gain traction.
The U.S. House of Representatives is expected to pass a $2.2 trillion stimulus package that will flood the world's largest economy with money to stem the damage caused by the pandemic.
The U.S. Federal Reserve has already slashed rates to zero and launched quantitative easing. The Fed will also take the unprecedented step of offering a direct backstop for corporate loans.
The United States is now the country with the most coronavirus cases, surpassing even China, where the flu-like illness first emerged late last year. Policymakers may need to offer more stimulus as the virus slams the brakes on economic activity and increases healthcare spending.
""I'm not sure what measures are left, but the reaction in stocks shows some people hoping for more stimulus thought the market was a little oversold,"" said Yukio Ishizuki, FX strategist at Daiwa Securities in Tokyo.
""Currencies tell a different story. The dollar is the lead actor. The mad rush to buy dollars due to liquidity concerns is starting to fade.""
The number of Americans filing claims for unemployment benefits surged to a record of more than 3 million last week as strict measures to contain the virus pandemic ground the country to a sudden halt, data showed on Thursday.
The jobless blowout was announced shortly after Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said the United States ""may well be in recession"", an unusual acknowledgement by a Fed chair that the economy may be contracting even before data confirms it.
Global equity markets took the data in their stride, partly as most central banks have already aggressively eased policy and governments are backing this up with big fiscal spending.
Chinese shares, battered this month because of the virus, rose 1.6% on Friday. Shares in South Korea, another country hit hard by the pandemic, rose 0.42%.
Leaders of the Group of 20 major economies pledged on Thursday to inject over $5 trillion into the global economy to limit job and income losses from the coronavirus.
CURRENCY MARKET
In the currency market, the greenback fell 1.16% to 108.34 yen in Asia, on pace for a 2.2% weekly decline.
The dollar was also headed for steep weekly declines against the Swiss franc, pound, and euro.
The U.S. currency's fall after two weeks of gains suggests the Fed's efforts to relieve a crunch in the dollar funding market are working, some analysts said.
The yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes fell in Asia to 0.7979%, while the two-year yield edged up to 0.2829%. 
Yields were headed for a weekly decline, taking cues from the Fed's extraordinary steps to bolster markets and the huge stimulus package.
U.S. crude rose 2.04% to $23.06 a barrel. Brent crude rose 0.84% to $26.56 per barrel. Energy markets have been caught in a tug-of-war between hopes for stimulus spending and worries about excess oil supplies.
Gold, normally bought as a safe haven, was slightly lower. Spot gold fell 0.34% to $1,626.01 per ounce. 

Gold market participants remained concerned about a supply squeeze after a sharp divergence between prices in London and New York. The virus has grounded planes used to transport gold and closed precious metal refineries.

434,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 26, 2020 11:45PM ET</span>",Investors Are Exiting Some Risky Asia ETFs With Over 40% Returns,"(Bloomberg) -- Investors are fleeing exchange-traded funds betting against stock index performance in some Asian markets, even as some vehicles generate returns of more than 40% amid the global coronavirus pandemic.
So far this year, international and domestic investors have withdrawn about $2.9 billion in net flows from inverse ETFs across Japan, South Korea and Taiwan, Asia’s biggest markets for such products, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s about 70% of last year’s total inflows.
Using derivatives such as futures and total return swaps, inverse ETFs are designed to move in the opposite direction of their benchmark on a daily basis. The health crisis has dragged down benchmark indexes in the three North Asian jurisdictions by about 20%, thus boosting returns for these instruments. The outflows mean some investors are cashing out, either to book profits or to avoid riskier investments.
The outflows are “common in leveraged products after very large returns,” said James Seyffart, an analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence. “We often see outflows in highly volatile or leveraged products because they are risky and investors tend to pull money and take profits when they get them.”
Another trigger for the exits may be that “people are simply viewing this as a potential bottom or at least short-term bottom and don’t want to hold inverse products,” Seyffart said.
Stock Traders Are Searching Ruins for Gems as Calm Descends
As of March 26, inverse ETFs run by Nomura Asset Management Co. had endured net outflows so far this year of about $1.7 billion, the most, followed by products from Yuanta Securities Investment Trust Co. and Samsung (KS:005930) Asset Management Co.
Even the best-performing vehicles haven’t been spared, with Japan-focused funds such as Rakuten ETF-Nikkei 225 Double Inverse Index, Simplex - Nikkei Average Bear Double Exchange Trade Fund and NEXT FUNDS Nikkei 225 Double Inverse Index Exchange Traded Fund witnessing redemptions even while generating returns of more than 40%. Currently, inverse ETFs investing in the three markets manage a combined $7.3 billion, Bloomberg data show.
Riskier ETFs were scrutinized as part of the broader passive investment industry during the global financial crisis for their role in market volatility. Furthermore, due to compounding, the returns of inverse ETFs can veer from targets if a fund is held for multiple days without rebalancing. BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK)., a global leader in ETF products, has argued that leveraged funds should not even be described as ETFs, given their complexity.

435,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 26, 2020 11:10PM ET</span>",End-of-week Gains for Asian Stocks,"By Gina Lee
Investing.com - Asian stock markets were up on the last trading day of the week despite drops in Chinese industrial profits and a huge rise in U.S. jobless claims.
China’s National Bureau of Statistics reported that industrial profits for January and February dropped 38.3% year on year, compared a 6.3% drop in December 2019. The steepest drop in a decade was due to lockdowns to curb the spread of COVID-19.
Despite the news, China’s Shanghai Composite was up 0.8% by 10:24 PM ET (2:24 AM GMT) while the Shenzhen Component was up 0.97%.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index was up by 1.07%.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 led the gains as it rose 1.55%, whilst next door South Korea’s KOSPI gained 1.75%.
The ASX 200 gave up earlier gains, losing 1.95%.
The United States announced an unprecedented 3.28 million jobless claims last week, triple the one million in forecasts compiled by investing.com.
Expectations that the House of Representatives will pass a $2.2 trillion stimulus package buoyed investor hopes and equities. United States Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell told NBC’s Today program on Thursday that: “When it comes to this lending, we’re not going to run out of ammunition, that doesn’t happen.”
“We still have policy room in other dimensions to support the economy.”
But Joseph Capurso, senior currency strategist at Commonwealth Bank of Australia, warned in a note: “We judge markets are pricing‑in a short sharp US recession. Our fear is the surge in jobless claims – even if the benefits paid will soon be increased – will draw-out the recession longer than markets expect.”"
436,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 26, 2020 10:30PM ET</span>",U.S. banks borrow at discount window after Fed offers stigma relief,"By David Henry
NEW YORK (Reuters) - With encouragement from the Federal Reserve, U.S. banks have turned to a long-shunned lending facility known as the discount window to borrow $50.8 billion, according to data the central bank released on Thursday.
The outstanding balance was the most since April 2009 and a reversal from negligible sums since the financial crisis. 
Borrowing at the discount window has long carried a stigma because of speculation about which banks were using it and whether they on verge of dumping assets at fire sale prices.
The Fed changed its disclosure practices last week to help curb such speculation. It will no longer show which of the 12 district banks in the Federal Reserve System made the loans in the national total. 
No longer, for example, can someone see a big increase in discount window borrowing through the Federal Reserve Bank in Kansas City and guess which bank might be having trouble with energy loans.
The Fed, in a note on its prior weekly release, said the change was made to support its goal announced on March 15 to use the discount window with other tools to encourage banks to lend to households and business during the coronavirus pandemic.
At the same time, the Fed slashed its target for its key interest rate by 1 percentage point to a range of 0% to 0.25%. It set the rate on discount window loans at 0.25%, basically eliminating the usual 0.50% extra penalty.
Healthy banks can get instant cash from the discount window in exchange for collateral, usually pools of loans. If the banks had to asked other lenders for cash it could spark doubts about their condition and feed a selling panic.
JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co Chief Executive Jamie Dimon said last month that his bank would use the discount window to help reduce the stigma.
Under the Dodd-Frank financial reform law, the Federal Reserve must disclose within two years which banks used the window, how much they borrowed and when.
Walker Todd, a visiting professor at the University of Akron and a former lawyer for regional Fed banks, said the Fed's shift to obscure details from weekly borrowing amounts violates the spirit of transparency of the law. 
""The Fed misreads the situation if it thinks this is in the public interest. Everyone expects the numbers to be large, so disclosure would cause no panic.""

UTC agreed in June to combine its aerospace business with U.S. contractor Raytheon and create a new company worth about $121 billion, in what would be the sector's biggest ever merger. It won EU antitrust approval earlier in March.
To win U.S. approval, the companies agreed to divest Raytheon's military airborne radios business, including facilities in Indiana and Florida, and UTC's military global positioning systems, including a facility in Connecticut. 
The businesses are to be sold to BAE Systems (LON:BAES) Inc or another buyer approved by the Justice Department.
The companies are the only Defense Department suppliers for military airborne radios and military GPS systems for air and sea, the Justice Department said.

The Justice Department said that the two companies were among the few companies that made components for certain military satellites, including those that warn of missile launches. Because of this, the department also required the companies to sell UTC's big space-based optical systems businesses.

DETROIT (Reuters) - The two largest U.S. automakers on Thursday announced measures to shore up their finances as the coronavirus pandemic takes a deep economic bite, with  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) aiming to resume production next month of its most profitable vehicles while cutting costs further.
General Motors Co (N:GM), the No. 1 U.S. automaker, said it planned to keep its plants closed indefinitely and was reducing the pay of salaried employees and executives and suspending some future product programs to conserve cash.
GM's chief executive and chief financial officer issued a stark warning to company employees in an internal video, saying that ""significant austerity measures"" were needed to preserve the company's long-term viability.
To generate cash, Ford said it was poised to restart production at some plants in North America as early as April 6, bringing back such profitable vehicles as its top-selling F-150 full-sized pickup, the Transit commercial van and SUVs. The plants that produce those vehicles are located in the U.S. states of Michigan and Kentucky and in Mexico.
To save cash, Ford said it was temporarily cutting top executives' salaries, among other actions. This came a day after Standard & Poor's downgraded the Dearborn, Michigan-based company's debt to ""junk"" status and warned more downgrades could be necessary. 
""The actions we're taking now are wide-ranging and substantial,"" Ford's chief executive, Jim Hackett, told employees in an email early on Thursday. ""We hope they will be enough to give Ford the financial flexibility to ride out the economic and business effects of the coronavirus.""
The pandemic, which has killed more than 21,000 people globally, has forced the shutdown of auto plants around the world as entire cities have gone into lockdown to stem the spread of the virus.
Ford previously drew down credit lines to build its cash position and suspended its dividend. GM also drew down its credit line, but did not suspend the dividend.
The U.S. Senate on Wednesday passed a $2 trillion economic rescue package to help unemployed workers and companies, including the auto industry, hit hard by the outbreak. The measure has been sent to the House of Representatives for a vote on Friday.
President Donald Trump, concerned about the economic repercussions of an extended shutdown, has said he wants America to get back to business by Easter, which is April 12.
GENERATING CASH
To get more cash coming in, Ford said it would restart key plants, while introducing additional safety measures to protect returning workers from the coronavirus. It said it would provide details on the new measures later.
To conserve cash, Ford said its top 300 executives would defer 20% to 50% of salaries for at least five months starting May 1, with the executive chairman deferring his entire salary. Hackett will defer half his salary.
However, Ford employees will continue to get healthcare coverage and those exposed to the virus and placed in quarantine will get paid time off, he added.
General Motors Co (N:GM) and  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCA) (MI:FCHA) (N:FCAU) previously said they would shut their North American operations through March 30 and reassess after that.
FCA on Thursday extended its shutdown through April 13, while its parts distribution centers will continue to operate with paid volunteers. Mexico's status is subject to a separate announcement.
GM on Thursday extended its shutdown indefinitely and said it would evaluate on a week-to-week basis.
GM's chief executive, Mary Barra, and chief financial officer, Dhivya Suryadevara, told company employees in the internal video, which Reuters heard a recording of, that it was essential that GM take immediate, aggressive steps to cut costs.
“If we don’t take significant austerity measures, we will do serious damage to the long-term viability of our company,” Suryadevara said. She noted that GM has very little revenue coming in “and we are preparing to operate the company temporarily on credit if necessary.""
Barra said GM was ""aggressively taking costs out of the business,"" including cutting its marketing budget ”and hundreds of other actions.""
To save cash and avoid layoffs, the automaker said salaried employees would have 20% of their pay deferred, executives 25% and senior leaders 30%, starting April 1. GM said the deferred money would be repaid in a lump sum no later than March 15, 2021. Health-care benefits are not affected.
GM also said 6,500 salaried employees, mostly in manufacturing and engineering, who are not able to work remotely are being paid 75% of their salary as part of a ""downtime paid absence"" program in lieu of collecting unemployment benefits.
In an email to employees on Thursday, seen by Reuters, Barra said GM for years has been making ""difficult decisions to strengthen our business and make it more resilient,"" and now those moves ""will be put to the test."" 
United Auto Workers President Rory Gamble said Thursday the union viewed announcements like Ford's with concern, and any decision to restart production should be based on data and each state's position with regards to the coronavirus outbreak.
The UAW has said three union members who worked at FCA plants have died due to the coronavirus.
Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer issued an order on Monday barring non-essential businesses from operating until April 13. 
Ford plans to begin production on one shift at its Hermosillo, Mexico, assembly plant, where it builds the Ford Fusion and Lincoln MKZ sedans. It will restart production on April 14 at its Dearborn plant that builds the F-150 and a Kentucky plant that makes the Super Duty version of the pickup as well as the Ford Expedition and Lincoln Navigator SUVs.

Ford shares closed down 2.4%, while GM rose 4.8%.

Shares of the Vancouver-based company fell about 3% after the closing bell. 
The company is seeing stay-at-home consumers buying more yoga mats and blocks, Chief Executive Officer Calvin McDonald told analysts on a post-earnings call, but online growth has not been enough to counter volumes lost from the store closures. 
In China, where Lululemon operated nearly 40 stores, the company has already reopened most stores except one in Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak, which is expected to open next week.
The company said it is planning for stores in North America to be closed for longer than they were in China.
Lululemon, which has been streaming its popular yoga classes on social media following the store closures, said it would consider redeploying some of those marketing dollars to drive its online business. 
""We know that initially, the business will be lower than it was pre-COVID-19 but we believe that each day and each week, it will keep building,"" McDonald said.
Gabriella Santaniello, founder of retail consulting firm A Line Partners, said Lululemon's efforts to stream yoga classes online and their ability to build a sense of community among customers would be an advantage as it looks to weather the hit from the health crisis.
""Lululemon started as a yoga company and you can actually do yoga inside!"" 
Like all retailers, the Canadian company has shut its stores across the world and focused on selling through its online platform as authorities clamp down on travel and lockdown cities to contain the spread of the coronavirus, which causes the respiratory illness COVID-19. 
""We are planning for multiple scenarios,"" McDonald added, without providing more details. 
Strong digital sales had also helped larger rival  Nike  Inc (N:NKE) beat estimates for its third-quarter and the company also held back from providing an outlook for its current-quarter. [nL4N2BH527]
Lululemon's total revenue rose 19.7% to $1.40 billion in the fourth quarter ended Feb. 2. Analysts on average had estimated revenue of $1.38 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. 
Total comparable sales jumped 20% in the quarter. 
The company's net income rose to $298 million, or $2.28 per share, from $218.5 million, or $1.65 per share, a year earlier. [nBw6jGhSJa]

Investing.com - Wall Street certainly reacted strongly to the record-setting jobless claims today, but maybe not in the way most would’ve predicted.
What the market clearly cares about is what the government is willing to dole out to backstop the economy. The signals are whatever it takes (the White House’s Larry Kudlow said a total rescue package could be closer to $6 trillion).
But the first stimulus bill still has to become law.
Here are three things that could move markets tomorrow.
1. Final Hurdle for Stimulus Bill (or Is it Bull?)
It’s up to the House of Representatives to carry the ball into the endzone tomorrow with its vote on the $2 trillion fiscal stimulus package.
The House will convene at 9 AM ET (13:00 GMT).
There were hopes from House majority Democrats that the bill, once passed by the Senate, could be quickly passed in the House by unanimous consent. But after rumblings that some representatives could object and delay the process further, a voice vote, where the ayes and nays vote out loud in groups, is now planned.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the bill could also be debated publicly.
""If somebody has a different point of view (about the bill), they can put it in the record,"" Pelosi said, referring to the Congressional Record.
What could throw a wrench in the works if there is a roll-call vote needed, which would require a quorum, with several lawmakers in quarantine and transportation limited.
2. Major Announcement as Trump Talks to Hannity?
Sometimes, like with postmarket earnings, what happens late today could affect trading tomorrow.
President Donald Trump will be interviewed by Fox’s Sean Hannity tonight and there could be some new White House policies revealed regarding the pandemic and the economy.
In his Fox town hall earlier this week Tuesday, Trump first floated the idea of reopening the U.S. economy on Easter. Rather than being an off-hand reply, that looks like what the president is shooting for now, based on later remarks.
Hannity is known to be a close adviser to the president, so a major policy announcement wouldn’t be out of the question. Trump told governors in a letter today that the federal government would rank counties on their risk of a Covid-19 outbreak, in a view to meeting the Easter deadline.
Hannity’s show airs on Fox News at 9 PM ET Thursday (01:00 GMT Friday).
3. Economic Data
Insofar as anyone can know right now how markets will react to economic data, there is more scheduled for tomorrow.
The University of Michigan will release its final measure of March consumer confidence at 10:00 AM ET (14:00 GMT).
The March consumer sentiment index is expected to drop to 90 from the preliminary measure of 95.9, according to economists’ forecasts compiled by Investing.com. The expectations measure is expected to remain at 85.3.
At 8:30 AM ET, the Bureau of Economic Analysis reports February personal spending and income numbers, which may be most of interest as the reference point before the jump off the cliff.
Spending is expected to have risen 0.2% for the month, while income is expected to have risen 0.4%.  "

In an email to suppliers seen by Reuters, the largest U.S automaker said ""given the unprecedented circumstances, exactly when we will resume production is unclear."" 
The company also said compensation of board members will be reduced by 20%, while executives will see a cut of 25% to 30%.
All employees will have 20% of their cash compensation deferred, beginning April 1, the company added stating that healthcare benefits are not impacted. 
GM also said deferment in salaried employees' compensation will be repaid in lump sum no later than March 15, 2021.

""Due to the impact that COVID-19 is having across the globe, and the rapid and continuous developments, we are not providing guidance for fiscal 2020 at this time. We will provide additional updates as the situation warrants,"" Lululemon said.
Lululemon Athletica shares lost 1.8% in after-hours trade following the report.
Lululemon Athletica announced earnings per share of $2.28 on revenue of $1.40 billion. Analysts polled by Investing.com anticipated EPS of $2.25 on revenue of $1.38 billion. That compares to EPS of $1.85 on revenue of $1.17 billion in the same period a year before. Lululemon had reported EPS of $0.96 on revenue of $916.14 million in the previous quarter.
The beat on the bottom line was supported by a 70-basis-point increase in gross margin to 55.9% year on year and growing comparable sales.
Comparable-store sales increased 9% and direct-to-consumer net revenue jumped 41%.
The better-than-expected performance comes as the Covid-19 pandemic has forced the retailer to shutter is stores in the U.S. and abroad. But there is a glimmer of hope in China, where the company is on the path to resume operations after the country went into lockdown for several weeks to contain the outbreak.
""In February 2020, we temporarily closed all of our retail locations in Mainland China. All but one of these locations have since reopened.

445,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 26, 2020 04:45PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Retailers start to cancel vendor orders following coronavirus hit,"By Melissa Fares
NEW YORK (Reuters) - After closing stores around the world to curb the spread of the coronavirus, retailers are now telling some vendors to immediately cancel orders.
On Thursday, discount store operator  Ross Stores Inc  (O:ROST) sent a letter to its vendors, notifying them it would cancel all merchandise purchase orders through June 18 due to the impact the novel coronavirus has had on its business.
""This is the first time in our history that we are unable to deliver exceptional merchandise to our customers,"" the memo, which was reviewed by Reuters, reads.
The Dublin, California-based discount store operator said it would also extend payment terms on all existing merchandise payables by 90 days.
A company spokesperson was not immediately available for comment.
Paul Rotstein, President and Chief Executive of Gold Medal International of New York City, which supplies accessories like socks and gloves to Ross Stores, said other retailers are making similar moves.
""We've had pretty much 100% cancellation from all major retailers,"" he said, naming Macy's Inc (N:M),  Nordstrom Inc  (N:JWN), TJX Companies Inc (N:TJX), and Burlington Coat Factory (UL:BCF) among his customers who have pressed pause on orders.
Macy's said on its website on Wednesday that the heavy toll from coronavirus is forcing it to freeze both hiring and spending, reducing receipts and extending the terms for payment of all goods and services.
The three other retailers were not available for comment.
""I've been doing this 38 years - this doesn't compare to anything I’ve experienced,"" Rotstein said. ""Just the loss of income, I mean, I think we’re looking at no income for at least 8 weeks.""
More than 470,800 people have been infected by the coronavirus across the world and over 21,200 have died, according to a Reuters tally. Earlier in the day, the U.S. government reported that the number of Americans filing claims for unemployment benefits surged to a record of more than 3 million last week, as strict measures to contain the coronavirus pandemic brought the country to a sudden halt.
Rotstein said that some retailers are asking him to ""just pause maybe another week or two to try and figure out what the receipts are going to look like in the third and fourth quarter.""
Last week, many government officials ordered all non-essential businesses to close in hopes of reigning in the spread of the virus, forcing retailers to dangle steep online discounts on clothing, shoes and accessories.
Some are ceasing online operations, too.
Shoppers searching TJX's tjmaxx.com, marshalls.com and sierra.com are directed to a statement from Ernie Herrman, CEO and President of The TJX Companies, alerting them that the retailer's thousands of store operations have been closed globally to reduce the spread of the virus.
""The company is also temporarily closing its online businesses tjmaxx.com, marshalls.com and sierra.com during this time, as well as its distribution and fulfillment centers and offices, with associates working remotely when they can,"" Herrman said.
Yoox (MI:YNAP) Net-a-Porter, which sells designer clothes, shoes, bags, and accessories online, notified customers visiting its U.S. site that it closed its warehouse ""in line with local government guidelines, and for the health and safety of our community.""
UK shoe retailer Schuh said on Thursday it had decided to close its online site as well as its stores to keep its staff, customers and community safe.
For some, demand online ""has picked up, but it hasn't picked up nearly as much as the loss of the brick-and-mortar"" sales, said Steve Sadove, a senior adviser for Mastercard (NYSE:MA) and former CEO and chairman of Saks Fifth Avenue.
Europe's biggest pure online fashion retailer Zalando said on Wednesday that restrictions on public life were hitting demand. A spokeswoman said demand for athleisure and gear for yoga and running has risen as people are forced to work – and exercise – at home.

Investing.com – The swashbuckling gains on Wall Street saw the Dow enter bull-market territory again as investors cast aside a record jump in jobless claims on growing hopes that stimulus will ensure that a widely-expected U.S. recession is short-lived.
The Dow jumped 6.38%, or 1,351 points. The Dow is up about 21% since its most recent low. The S&P 500 surged 6.24% and the Nasdaq Composite rose 5.60%.
In an interview with NBC, Federal Reserve Jerome Powell conceded the U.S. ""may well already in a recession,"" but boosted investor expectations for more stimulus by insisting the central bank had plenty of ammo after it pledged earlier this week to ramp-up its bond-buying program.
""When it comes to lending, we are not going to run out of ammunition,” Powell said. ""That just doesn’t happen.""
Main Street, meanwhile, could be next up on the Fed's agenda. Powell reportedly said the central bank is working on a Main Street Lending Facility to support smaller businesses, Bloomberg reported.
With the well of monetary policy seemingly at little risk of running dry, and a fiscal boost expected imminently as Congress readies the launch of its $2 trillion stimulus package, investors raised their bullish bets on stock, with the more defensive names like utilities and real estate among the biggest gainers.
Industrials, meanwhile, continued to get a lift from Boeing (NYSE:BA), up 13.5%, as the stimulus bill -- expected to be approved by the House -- will provide the aviation sector with a much-needed fiscal boost.
The rally on Wall Street comes even as Covid-19 infections continued to mount worldwide, with cases in the U.S. surging to nearly 76,000 and deaths topping 1,000. In Italy, the epicenter of the outbreak in Europe, infections surged by 6,153, the most in five days, taking the global tally to above 500,000.
Financials also supported the broad-based rally, led by banking, even as Treasury yields dropped.

453,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 26, 2020 03:05PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Cirque du Soleil explores options including bankruptcy - sources,"By Mike Spector and Jessica DiNapoli
(Reuters) - Cirque du Soleil Entertainment Group is exploring debt restructuring options that include a potential bankruptcy filing, after it was forced to cancel shows because of the coronavirus outbreak, people familiar with the matter said.
The famed Montreal-based circus company, largely known for its regular shows in Las Vegas venues, had to temporarily lay off most of its staff after social distancing measures put in place to prevent the spread of the virus nixed its performances.
Cirque du Soleil is working with restructuring advisers to address a cash crunch and its roughly $900 million in debt, the sources said on Thursday.
Creditors are also in talks with advisers as they prepare for possible negotiations with the company, the sources said. 
Cirque du Soleil has not yet decided how to address its strained finances, the sources cautioned, requesting anonymity to discuss confidential deliberations. The company declined to comment.
Entertainment companies that put on shows in confined spaces, such as movie theaters and theme parks, are reeling in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, which has sickened nearly 500,000 people and caused more than 22,000 deaths around the world.
Attempting to slow infections, governments have banned large gatherings, ordered people to remain at home and shut businesses deemed nonessential, including casinos. 
Cirque du Soleil's layoffs affected more than 4,600 employees, or about 95% of its workforce, the company said.
Cirque du Soleil's current woes have been exacerbated by debt taken on to fund a $1.5 billion deal in 2015 that resulted in private equity firm TPG acquiring a majority stake in the company. TPG has enlisted its own restructuring advisers to work through the company's deteriorating finances, the sources said. The private equity firm declined to comment. 
Moody's Investors Service earlier this month cut Cirque du Soleil's credit rating deep into junk territory and said there was a ""high risk"" the company would default on its debt. Canceled shows this year are expected to result in steep financial losses for the company ""with limited prospects for a tenable capital structure thereafter,"" the ratings firm said in a March 18 note. 
Cirque du Soleil had about $105 million in funds available as of December, consisting of $20 million in cash and the rest from a revolving credit line, Moody's said. Cirque du Soleil is expected to spend about $165 million over the next year, including on ticket reimbursements for canceled shows and debt payment, the ratings firm said. 

A portion of Cirque du Soleil's term loan was trading at 48 cents on the dollar this week, indicating investor concerns about the company's ability to repay its debts.

Investing.com – The Dow neared session highs on Thursday underpinned by a wave of optimism that Federal Reserve and Congress will continue to rescue the economy at a time when nationwide containment measures have brought business activity to a halt and sparked a record jump in unemployment claims.
The Dow jumped 4.97%, or 1,053 points, the S&P 500 surged 4.83% and the Nasdaq Composite rose 4.09%.
With Congress expected to pass a $2 trillion stimulus package and Fed Chairman Jerome Powell reiterating the central bank's pledge to ramp up its bond-buying program, investors are betting big on stocks once again.
In an interview with NBC News earlier Thursday, Powell conceded that the U.S. ""may well be in a recession,"" but the Fed is ""working hard"" ensure that an eventual recovery will be strong as possible.
""When it comes to lending, we are not going to run out of ammunition,” he added. ""That just doesn’t happen.""
The pledge from the Fed chief came as Covid-19 infections in the U.S. surged above 75,000, with deaths topping 1,000. The lockdown measures to combat the virus has forced major disruptions across businesses, the effect of which was seen in the weekly initial jobless claims figures, which came in at 3.3 million. Claims hadn't topped 700,000 before. 
Industrials, meanwhile, continued to get a lift from Boeing (NYSE:BA), up 14%, as the stimulus bill - expected to be approved by the House – will provide the aviation sector with much-needed fiscal boost.
Financials, led by banking stocks also joined in on the rally even as Treasury yields fell sharply.
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) rallied more than 5%.  
Lower interest rates are typically a headwind for banks, weighing on net interest margin – the difference between the interest income generated by banks and the amount of interest paid out to their lenders.

463,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 26, 2020 01:35PM ET</span>","U.S. banks to score accounting, capital relief in $2 trillion rescue package","By Pete Schroeder
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. banking industry is set to get relief from a new global accounting rules standard, a small-bank leverage charge and other lending rules with the expected passage of a record $2 trillion congressional stimulus package in coming days.
The financial services industry, including big banks, community lenders, credit unions, and payday and auto financing lenders, joined a frenzy of lobbying on Capitol Hill in recent days as lawmakers rushed to craft the record package to prop up the economy amid chaos wrought by the novel coronavirus.
While many of the industry wins in the legislation, which awaits approval by the U.S. House of Representatives, are temporary, lobbyists hope the measures will pave the way for longer-term relief on a number of regulations they have long opposed. 
""Although banks will face a number of market headwinds, there are a handful of notable victories in this package for depositories,"" said Isaac Boltansky, director of policy research at Washington-based Compass Point Research & Trading. 
In particular, the bill allows banks to delay complying with a new accounting standard which the industry has been trying to kill for years, saying its requirement that lenders estimate potential future losses on loans could exacerbate liquidity stresses. 
Community banks also scored a win with a temporary lowering of their leverage ratio from 9% to 8%, the level the industry had been pushing for when the rule was finalized last year.
In addition, the bill reprises a measure from the 2008 financial crisis by allowing the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) to temporarily guarantee debt issued by banks it oversees, as well as guaranteeing all deposits in non-interest bearing bank accounts. 
That is on top of the interest-bearing accounts with up to $250,000 in deposits that the agency already insures.
The bill would also temporarily direct the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency to scrap limits on how much banks can lend to a single client, and cements regulatory guidance issued last week temporarily waiving higher capital charges when banks restructure distressed debt.
The legislative relief follows a flurry of measures from banking and markets regulators to ease up on lenders so they can continue to dole out credit amid a sharpening economic slump. While the measures are temporary, analysts, lobbyists and consumer groups believe some may ultimately stick.

In a statement on Thursday, government watchdog Public Citizen said that while flexibility was warranted amid the coronavirus outbreak, it was ""concerned about exemptions that can create systemic risks.""

467,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 26, 2020 01:27PM ET</span>",A Bull Market in Banks and Other Weird Facts of the Stock Bounce,"(Bloomberg) -- Moves in stock sectors that ordinarily take months and years to play out are happening in days as investors struggle to establish prices in the age of the coronavirus. Beneath the turbulent surface of major benchmarks, individual industries are moving with bone-shaking speed.
Take a look at this chart of the biggest S&P 500 groups since the index hit its low point three days ago. Going by one admittedly hackneyed definition, it shows energy producers, industrial companies and banks have pulled out of the bear market they entered earlier this month.
Of course, take the starting point back a little ways, to the February top, and the same three groups fall straight to the bottom.
It’s not just certain sectors. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 20% since its March 23 low, after an 11% surge on Tuesday, the biggest in nine decades, and a 7.2% run in the next two days. The gauge’s biggest constituent, Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co, has jumped 91% this week.
Industrials, energy and financial companies were the three worst performers in the S&P 500 between Feb. 20 and last week. That’s prompted investors to rush in to take advantage of discount valuations as a combination of fiscal and monetary stimulus fuel aggressive risk-taking.
It doesn’t mean we’re out of the woods yet, but it seems that days of an unprecedented sell-off such as the one from earlier this month are behind us. To Chris Harvey, Well Fargo Securities’ head of equity strategy, the S&P 500’s close on Monday at 2,237 marked the market bottom. It can be retested if politicians keep on dickering about an unprecedented stimulus package, he said.
‘Animal Spirits’
The S&P 500 is up 12% since Friday, on track for its best week since 1974, after the Federal Reserve unveiled an unprecedented monetary stimulus and the White House and Senate struck a deal on fiscal aid.
This seems to be “a delayed reaction to the Fed and Treasury backstopping a whole range of assets and the benefits from the $2 trillion package,” said Ilya Feygin, senior strategist at WallachBeth Capital. “On the other hand, this is a tough entry point to go out and buy” after assets “have already rallied so much.”
These types of rallies are not uncommon in periods of extreme volatility. During the height of the financial crisis, in October 2008, the S&P posted two single-digit gains of more than 10% in a matter of two weeks. To Miller Tabak’s Matt Maley, the current price action means that the stock market’s recent lows could be retested in the short run.
“These three groups are washed out, there’s no one else to sell, but it doesn’t mean new sellers aren’t coming in,” Maley said. “It’s an unprecedented jump after a historic slump. Animal spirits are running high.”

470,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 26, 2020 01:00PM ET</span>","Signet Jewelers in $240 million settlement over sexual harassment, loan portfolio","By Jonathan Stempel
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Signet Jewelers Ltd (N:SIG) has reached a $240 million settlement of a shareholder lawsuit accusing the company of concealing sexual harassment allegations against senior executives and losses in its customer financing credit portfolio.
The preliminary settlement of the proposed class action was filed on Thursday with the federal court in Manhattan, and requires approval by Chief Judge Colleen McMahon.
Signet, whose brands include Jared, Kay Jewelers and Zales, also posted higher-than-expected operating profit and revenue in its fiscal fourth quarter ended Feb. 1, with same-store sales rising 2.3%.
It said it expects to pay about $35 million of the settlement, with insurers funding the remainder.
Shares of Signet soared, and in early afternoon trading were up $2.86, or 39%, at $10.19.
The settlement resolved claims that Signet concealed how it had once been ""rife with sexual harassment"" of female employees, including by senior executives, and downplayed its alleged misconduct as involving merely allegations of gender discrimination in pay and promotions at individual stores.
Shareholders led by the Public Employees' Retirement System of Mississippi also said Signet concealed losses on subprime loans that once comprised 45% of its $1.7 billion customer loan portfolio, and which it later sold at a roughly $160 million loss.
The accord covers shareholders from Aug. 29, 2013 to May 25, 2017 who said Signet's violation of federal securities laws caused them to suffer losses on their stock.
In a statement, Signet said it takes its legal disclosure obligations seriously and believed the lawsuit lacked merit, but settled to eliminate ""the risks, ongoing resource needs, and the distraction of this litigation.""
In its fiscal fourth quarter, Signet posted net income of $187.1 million, compared with a year-earlier $107.9 million net loss.
Adjusted profit totaled $3.67 per share on revenue of $2.15 billion. Analysts expected profit of $3.47 per share on revenue of $2.12 billion according to Refinitiv IBES.
To bolster financial flexibility during the coronavirus pandemic, Signet said it has drawn down an additional $900 million from a secured credit facility, and temporarily suspended its common stock dividend.

Canada will purchase C$150 billion (C$137 billion) in insured mortgage backed securities from financial institutions, the agency said Thursday. That’s triple the initially planned C$50 billion, and represents about 80% of the value of government-guaranteed mortgage backed securities on bank balance sheets.
“It’s a substantial commitment,” Andrew Kelvin, senior Canada rates strategist at TD Securities, said in an email.
The increase in proposed acquisitions, which will take place via Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation’s newly created Insured Mortgage Purchase Program, highlights the speed at which Canadian authorities are upping the amount of liquidity they plan to inject into the country’s financial institutions, as markets struggle to keep adequate credit flowing through an economy slammed by the coronavirus.
Thursday’s announcement adds to a growing list of measures officials are taking to deal with the disruption to credit markets. That includes a purchase operation of C$24 billion in assets by the Bank of Canada on Thursday through term repos, double the amount a couple of days ago.
Last week the government also said it would allow lenders to add previously uninsured mortgages into into the pool of securities eligible to be bought by the government.
That widening of eligibility means the number of mortgage backed securities available will likely grow beyond the current C$186 billion figure.
CMHC also said Thursday it’s ready to expand the issuance of Canada Mortgage Bonds up to C$60 billion, a move that adds to the total amount of mortgage debt available for transactions in the system.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - WeWork told investors on Thursday the $4.4 billion in cash and cash commitments it had on hand at year-end 2019 is sufficient to execute its five-year plan, including managing the challenges posed by the recession-bearing coronavirus crisis.
WeWork, whose losses more than doubled to $1.25 billion as of the third quarter of 2019, told bond investors in a letter reviewed by Reuters that it was in a sound financial position to execute its previously announced plan through 2024. 
WeWork said it had $1.3 billion in cash at year end, $800 million of cash that became unrestricted when it closed on a new letter of credit facility in February and $2.2 billion senior unsecured debt funding from major shareholder SoftBank Group.
WeWork said there was another $100 million of remaining capital commitments from SoftBank, according to the letter. WeWork did not indicate the size of its losses by year-end.
The company has said it will release full-year 2019 results to bond holders after markets close at 4 p.m. on Thursday.
WeWork faces a tough business environment as its costs rise due to the coronavirus outbreak. The yield on its junk bonds in the past month has tumbled by more than half as markets plunged on pandemic-induced recession fears, a slowdown that is likely to further erode WeWork revenues and increase its costs.

S&P Global's credit rating unit on Monday cut WeWork's 7.875% bond further into junk territory and put the company on watch for possibly another downgrade over concerns about the commitment to WeWork of major shareholder SoftBank Group (T:9984).

Most of FCA's plants around the world are currently shut in response to the virus emergency. Italian investment firm Exor (MI:EXOR), which controls FCA, said on Wednesday that the temporary closures might continue and increase depending on how the coronavirus outbreak develops.
Fiat Chrysler (FCA) said the credit facility would be available ""for general corporate purposes and for working capital needs"" of the group and that it was structured as a ""bridge facility"" to support its access to capital markets. 
""This transaction confirms the continued strong support of FCA's international key relationship banks in the current extraordinary circumstances,"" the automaker said in a statement, without making any explicit link between the new facility and the impact the virus is having on the global economy. 
The facility can be drawn in a single tranche of 3.5 billion euros ($3.8 billion), with an initial 12-month term which can be extended for further six months. It adds to existing credit facilities worth 7.7 billion euros, including lines for 1.5 billion euros that the company has started to draw down, FCA said.
FCA is in merger talks with  Peugeot  owner PSA (PA:PEUP) to create the world's fourth biggest carmaker. The deal is expected to be finalised by the first quarter of next year.
Equita's analyst Martino De Ambroggi said that, based on his new assumption of a 10% drop of global auto market this year, the crisis triggered by the coronavirus would impact the merged automaker's free cash flow by over 5 billion euros.

494,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 26, 2020 10:18AM ET</span>",U.S. Mortgage Rates Slip While Home Sales Head for Deep Freeze,"(Bloomberg) -- U.S. mortgage rates fell for the first time in three weeks. But for would-be homebuyers frozen in fear of an economic meltdown, borrowing costs are no longer a prime concern.
The average rate for a 30-year fixed loan was 3.5%, down from 3.65% last week, Freddie Mac said in a statement Thursday.
Americans hunkering down in coronavirus quarantine are in no mood to shop for homes. Even if they can buy, many worry about how bad the coming recession will be, and how long it will last.
In an early sign of slipping demand, a index of applications for home-purchase loans tumbled 15% last week to its lowest level since August, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association.
Home sales are going to drop, no matter what mortgage rates do, said Matthew Speakman, an economist at Zillow. Eventually, the virus will pass and loan costs will start to matter again.
“In the short term, the impact of mortgage rates on home sales has weakened due to the fact there are these shelter-in-place initiatives and consumer confidence has taken a hit,” Speakman said. “Where mortgage rates are going to help is when we find ourselves ready and in place to recover.”
The virus has roiled financial markets, sending mortgage rates and the Treasury yields that guide them on a roller-coaster ride. The average rate for a 30-year loan had tumbled to a record-low 3.29% three weeks ago.
The Federal Reserve, which dropped its benchmark lending rate to near zero, has pledged to buy unlimited amounts of mortgage bonds. That move may help calm some panicked investors who seek to free up cash as Americans lose jobs and fall behind on loan payments.
The Fed’s “swift and significant efforts to stabilize the market were much needed,” Sam Khater, Freddie Mac’s chief economist, said in a statement. “Real estate demand is softening. However, the combination of the Fed’s actions and pending economic stimulus will provide substantial support to the mortgage markets.”

The Swiss company also said it would temporarily raise wages by $3 per hour for on-duty factory and distribution center workers in Canada, retroactive to March 16, 2020.
Additionally, it would pay bonuses to salaried employees of its Canadian factories who cannot work from home, and salaries for up to eight weeks to those in retail operations, which have been temporarily closed, Nestle Canada said in a statement.

499,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 26, 2020 09:45AM ET</span>",Ford’s Plan to Gradually Reopen U.S. Factories Concerns UAW,"(Bloomberg) -- Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co.’s plan to restart production at some of its most important U.S. plants roughly a month after they shut down will have to overcome immediate skepticism from the United Auto Workers union.
After halting North American production as of March 19 amid the spread of the coronavirus, Ford said in a statement that it’s aiming to restart production at a sedan factory in Mexico on April 6, then several facilities in the U.S. on April 14. The UAW quickly issued a statement of its own saying the union is uneasy about the scheduled resumption of work.
“We are reviewing with great concern and caution today’s announcement,” the UAW said Thursday. “Our priority is the health and safety of our members, their families and the American public.”
Tension between the UAW and carmakers is likely going to be high as Ford, General Motors Co (NYSE:GM). and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV seek to get assembly lines running again. Two union members who worked at Fiat Chrysler plants in Michigan and Indiana died after contracting Covid-19, and the companies have confirmed several other coronavirus cases among their staff.
Ford said it will put in place additional safety measures to protect returning workers as it brings the plants back online. A Ford employee at a plant in Wayne, Michigan, tested positive for the virus earlier this month.
The shutdowns have pressured Ford’s finances and contributed to S&P Global Ratings downgrading the automaker to junk on Wednesday. After suspending its dividend, fully drawing down $15.4 billion from two credit lines and retracting the earnings guidance given to investors on Feb. 4, management is sharing in the sacrifice.
Effective May 1, top executives’ base salaries will be put off by at least five months, Ford said in a regulatory filing Thursday. The deferrals apply to Executive Chairman Bill Ford’s entire salary and half of the base pay for Chief Executive Officer Jim Hackett, Chief Operating Officer Jim Farley and Chief Financial Officer Tim Stone.
The executives will receive their deferred salary amounts after the company has repaid at least $7 billion of its automotive debt, according to the filing.
CEO’s Memo
Hackett, 64, said in a letter to employees Thursday that the deferrals will apply to the top 300 senior executives at Ford.
While the company may pare back work schedules and compensation for people whose jobs can’t be done effectively away from Ford’s facilities, the goal is to manage through the crisis without eliminating jobs, he said.
“If the effects of the coronavirus on the global economy and Ford go on for longer -- or are more severe -- than we currently anticipate, we may have to take tougher actions,” Hackett wrote. “But not today.”
Ford shares rose as much as 4.8% shortly after the start of regular trading. The stock has dropped about 40% this year.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock market opened higher on Thursday, weighing the biggest-ever weekly surge in initial jobless claims against the prospect of the U.S.’s biggest-ever stimulus package being signed into law by the end of the week.
By `10:25 AM ET (1425 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 870 points, or 4.1% at 22,071. The S&P 500 was up 3.9% and the NASDAQ Composite was up 3.2%.
The indices had posted their first back-to-back gains in six weeks on Wednesday in anticipation of the $2 trillion stimulus package drafted by the Senate coming into law by Friday. The bill, which earmarks some $540 billion for payments to households and $1 trillion in loans to businesses, state and local governments, passed 96-0 in the upper house, lifting hopes that there will be no further delay.
The Bureau of Labor Statistics said Thursday that 3.283 million Americans filed for unemployment benefit last week, twice the expected 1.65 million, as companies across the country laid off workers due to the Covid-19 epidemic.
That’s over 1% of the entire U.S. population, over 2% of a workforce measured last month at 164.6 million. For comparison, 5.8 million people were registered as unemployed in February.
“Sadly, this isn't peak as many more layoffs occurred in recent days,” Greg Daco, U.S. economist with Oxford Economics, said via Twitter. He said unemployment was likely to surge well above 10% in April. St. Louis Fed President James Bullard had said at the start of the week that the jobless rate could hit 30% in the second quarter as the virus peaks.
Among individual stocks, Boeing (NYSE:BA) stock was up 12.8% amid reports that up to $17 billion of government loan guarantees and other aid would be made available to it under the terms of the stimulus package.
CEO David Calhoun said earlier this week that Boeing doesn’t need the government to take an equity stake in the company, something that would dilute existing shareholders.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock was up 1.9% despite a report by the Japanese newspaper Nikkei alleging that it was preparing to postpone the launch of its new 5G iPhones in the fall.
Among airline stocks, American (NASDAQ:AAL), Delta (NYSE:DAL) and United (NASDAQ:UAL) were all up by between 4.6% and 11% as the prospect of government assistance drew nearer.

Caterpillar said it was executing business continuity plans and warned of likely supply constraints, and that it could use alternative sources to redirect orders to other distribution centers.
U.S. factory manufacturing activity slowed in February as new orders contracted, reflecting worries about supply chain disruptions related to the fast-spreading coronavirus outbreak, which has revived financial market fears of a recession.
Caterpillar in January said it expected adjusted profit in 2020 in the range of $8.50 to $10 per share on the back of a further decline in equipment sales. The forecast is lower than $11.06 per share last year.

DETROIT (Reuters) -  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) said on Thursday it planned to restart production at some plants in North America as early as April 6, bringing back its most profitable vehicles at a time when U.S. demand has slumped and the No. 2 U.S. automaker is conserving cash to survive the coronavirus pandemic.
The Dearborn, Michigan-based company said it was bringing key plants back online, while introducing additional safety measures to protect returning workers from the coronavirus pandemic. 
Among the vehicles Ford will begin production of again are the sales-leading F-150 full-sized pickup and heavier-duty versions of the truck, as well as commercial vans and SUVs.
""We will continue to assess public health conditions as well as supplier readiness and will adjust plans if necessary,"" the company said https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2020/03/26/ford-aims-to-restart-production-at-key-north-american-plants.html in a statement. 
The global coronavirus outbreak, which has killed more than 21,000 people, has forced the shutdown of auto plants around the world as companies attempt to curtail the spread of the disease among factory employees.
The outbreak has put pressure on companies, including Ford, which drew down credit lines to build its cash position. That move led Standard & Poor's on Wednesday to downgrade the company's debt to ""junk"" status and warn Ford was at risk of another downgrade.
The U.S. Senate on Wednesday passed a $2 trillion economic rescue package to help unemployed workers and companies, including the auto industry, hit hard by the outbreak.
U.S. President Donald Trump, concerned about the economic repercussions of an extended shutdown, has said he wants America to get back to business by Easter, or April 12, suggesting some efforts to slow the spread of the outbreak will no longer be needed by then.
General Motors Co (N:GM) and  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCA) (MI:FCHA) (N:FCAU) previously said they would shut down their North American operations through March 30 and then reassess after that. 
""The situation is fluid and can change week to week,"" GM spokesman Jim Cain said on Thursday. ""We don’t have firm return-to-work dates at this time.""
FCA spokeswoman Jodi Tinson said on Thursday the Italian-American automaker was evaluating the situation.
UAW President Rory Gamble said on Tuesday in a letter to union members that Ford and FCA had no plans to reopen manufacturing operations on March 30. The UAW has said three union members who worked at FCA plants have died due to the coronavirus.
Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer issued an order on Monday barring non-essential businesses from operating until April 13. A spokeswoman for Whitmer was previously unable to clarify whether auto production was considered essential or not.
Ford plans to begin production on one shift at its Hermosillo, Mexico, assembly plant, where it builds the Ford Fusion and Lincoln MKZ sedans.
It will restart production on April 14 at its Dearborn plant that builds the F-150 and a Kentucky plant that makes the Super Duty version of the pickup as well as the Ford Expedition and Lincoln Navigator SUVs. 

The Ford Transit van line at its Kansas City, Missouri, plant, the Ohio plant that builds Econoline vans and heavy duty trucks, and several stamping, transmission and parts plants also will restart on that day.

(Reuters) - BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) and  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) reckon it is time to get back into equities after markets rallied this week following massive government and central bank stimulus packages to fight fallout from the coronavirus crisis.
The $2 trillion U.S. fiscal stimulus has triggered big gains in global stocks, sending investors rushing to dust-off models from the 2008 crisis to gauge the right time to buy.
World stocks (MIWD00000PUS) have risen nearly 8% so far this week and were on track for their best weekly gain since December 2011. They have recouped more than $5 trillion in the past two days.
Spotting an inflection point is not easy when the virus is still spreading rapidly across Europe and the United States, but BlackRock and Credit Suisse said on Thursday they had turned slightly bullish on risk assets.
""The unprecedented actions represent the type of decisive policy response we have been calling for – and set the scene for an eventual economic recovery,"" Jean Boivin, head of BlackRock Investment Institute, said on Thursday.
The world's top asset manager said the market sell-off had created significant value for long-term investors and told clients it now favored ""rebalancing into risk assets."" 
Within the equity space, BlackRock said it preferred U.S. markets due to strength of Washington's policy response and the quality of the market.
Many investors are still trying to work out when will be the right time to re-enter markets. At least one model from JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) shows the correct time would be now, based on a view that a recession would be shortlived. 
Credit Suisse, which is positive on developed market equities, said: ""There is merit in being an early mover rather than wait until a market bottom has become apparent for all.""
The Swiss bank said that over a six- to twelve-month horizon, equities offered ""attractive value.""
Notably, U.S. and European stock valuations based on a 12-month forward price-to-earnings ratio now have dipped well below historical averages, according to Refinitiv data.

The Ohio-based restaurant chain also reported same-store sales growth of only 2.8% so far in the first quarter and withdrew its forecasts, suspended share buybacks as the company prepares to battle the financial fallout of the pandemic.
The U.S. restaurant industry is likely to be among the most severely hurt by the outbreak, as scared customers cook at home instead of dining out and governments force restaurants to shut dining rooms and switch to drive-thru, delivery and take-out only. 
The company said same-restaurant sales in the week ended March 22 fell about 20%. Analysts had anticipated a 4% growth in same-store sales for the quarter ending March, as the restaurant chain was expected to benefit from the launch of a breakfast menu earlier this month. 
The breakfast launch saw sales rise about 15% in the first week of March. However, Wendy's said on Thursday it now plans to scrap any additional marketing spend on its breakfast menu this year. 
The company joins a list of fast-food operators, who are providing some relief to its franchisees. Dunkin' Brands Group Inc (O:DNKN) last week vowed to ease royalty payments, while McDonald's Corp (N:MCD) is considering a reduction in some payments, including rent for franchisees. 
""This is an unprecedented time, and we are focused on the actions where we can make a positive difference,"" Wendy's Chief Executive Officer Todd Penegor said.
Wendy's said it would extend payment terms for royalties and marketing funds by 45 days for the next three months and also defer base rent payments on properties owned by the company and leased to franchisees by 50% over the next three months.

As seen across the globe, Wendy's is also seeing a surge in its delivery business and drive-thru services. It said that in the United States, the services saw a ""significant increase"", especially through last week.

LONDON (Reuters) - Share markets across the world fell on Thursday as nerves over jobs data likely to lay bare the economic carnage from the coronavirus pandemic outweighed a $2 trillion U.S. stimulus package.
The U.S. Senate on Wednesday backed the massive bill aimed at helping jobless workers and industries reeling from the disruption caused by the outbreak, with the package heading for the House of Representatives for a vote on Friday.
Yet already questions flew over whether the bill would do enough to soften the disease's economic hammer blow, with investors bracing for a U.S. jobs report to show a huge spike in unemployment in the world's biggest economy.
Europe's broad Euro STOXX 600 fell 1.8%, with bourses in Frankfurt, London and Paris all down around 2.5% as a two-day rally faltered.
The sour mood was worsened by slumping consumer morale in Germany and data showing stagnant retail sales in Britain last month, even before the virus hit.
E-mini futures for the S&P 500 last traded down 1.3%, pointing to a weaker start on Wall Street, while the MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 49 countries, was flat.
Global markets have lost about a quarter of their value in the last six weeks of virus-driven selling. 
And while markets have found a measure of sustenance as governments and central banks launch unprecedented support measures, investors were struggling to work out how bad the coronavirus impact would be. 
""No-one is sure how long things are going to be locked down for, how wide the virus will spread in the U.S., what the death toll and hit on the economy will look like,"" said Salman Baig, portfolio manager at Unigestion. 
Earlier, Asia saw a mixed session. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 1.1% but regional performances varied. 
The Nikkei snapped three days of gains in Tokyo with a 4.5% drop, while Australia's benchmark rose for a third day - its longest winning streak in six weeks. 
UNEMPLOYMENT TO SURGE
Markets were to get a glimpse of the on-the-ground damage to the U.S. economy, with data on jobless claims due at 1230 GMT. Forecasts in a Reuters poll ranged from 250,000 to 4 million unemployment claims.
RBC Capital Markets economists had expected a national figure of more than 1 million, but say ""it is now poised to be many multiples of that"", as lockdowns drive deep lay-offs.
""Something in the 5-10 million range for initial jobless claims is quite likely,"" they wrote in a note. That compares to a 695,000 peak in 1982.
""In less than two weeks, we have moved from full employment to a number of job destruction we have never experienced in a period of peace,"" wrote Christopher Dembik, head of macro analysis at Saxo Bank.
Though the money at stake in the stimulus bill amounts to nearly half of the $4.7 trillion the U.S. government spends annually, it comes against a backdrop of bad news as coronavirus spreads and signs of growing economic damage across the globe.
Tokyo's governor asked residents to avoid going out and to ""act with a sense of crisis"". Spain's coronavirus death toll has overtaken China's, while deaths globally have reached more than 21,000.
In Singapore, the economy suffered its biggest contraction in a decade in the first quarter and factories posted their largest output drop since records began in 1983.
The growing sense of unease over the U.S. jobs figures also played out in currency markets. 
The dollar lost 0.8% against a basket of six major currencies to 100.150 as its recent rally continued to lose steam. It also slumped 1.4% against the perceived safety of the Japanese yen, extending losses through the morning.
The softer greenback buoyed emerging market currencies, with MSCI's index touching a one-week high. 
Oil fell as fears of plunging demand outweighed expectations of support from the U.S. stimulus. Brent crude futures fell 0.5% to $27.25, clawing back some of their earlier losses.

 HSBC Holdings  Plc (LON:HSBA) warned it still expects to book higher credit losses on the back of the pandemic even after the Bank of England gave lenders leeway to deal with unpaid loans.
In an update to investors contained in the prospectus for its latest debt sale, HSBC said it would have to take into account the impact of virus on economies, when it measures potential losses in its upcoming financial results. The lender, which generates most of its revenue in Asia, added the economic disruption caused by the virus could have “adverse impacts” on the value of its assets, including its holding in China’s Bank of Communications Co Ltd.
The disclosure was made in a U.S. filing on Wednesday. Last week, the Bank of England said financial institutions should be flexible when applying the accounting rules, as part of a package of measures, which included canceling its annual banking industry stress tests.
“An immediate impact in early 2020 will be higher expected credit losses driven by a change in the economic scenarios used to calculate ECL,” said the bank. HSBC cited the new IFRS9 accounting standard, which requires banks to forecast their outlook for gross domestic product.
Europe’s largest lender said the actions taken by central banks and governments across the world to dampen the impact of the outbreak could lead to restrictions on the movement of capital. “These may limit management’s flexibility in managing the business and taking action in relation to capital distribution and capital allocation,” according to the bank.
 Barclays  (LON:BARC) Plc has already said the pandemic is likely to mean the bank will miss its profitability target. Speaking at a virtual conference last week, Barclays’ Chief Financial Officer Tushar Morzaria said it would be a “tough year for earnings.”

511,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 26, 2020 07:21AM ET</span>","Detroit's near future based on SUVs, not EVs, production plans show","By Paul Lienert, Joseph White and Ben Klayman
DETROIT (Reuters) - General Motors Co (N:GM) and  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) have widely touted their commitment to emission-free electric cars, but their production plans show a growing reliance on ever-larger gas-powered vehicles. 
The two biggest U.S. automakers will make more than 5 million SUVs and pickup trucks in 2026, but only about 320,000 electric vehicles, according to detailed production plans for North America seen by Reuters. 
That will be about 5% of their combined vehicle production in North America, but less than Tesla Inc (O:TSLA), the world leader in electric vehicles, produced last year.
The plans show that Detroit's Big Two are betting their short-term future on satisfying America’s demand for bigger, petroleum-fueled vehicles which they can sell at a higher profit margin than mostly smaller, expensive-to-develop electric vehicles.
Large SUVs consume about a quarter more energy than midsize cars, meaning the plans will most likely wipe out any gains in overall fuel efficiency or reduction in auto emissions that were targeted over the next six years, according to industry experts. 
The recent collapse of oil prices - pointing toward cheap gas for the foreseeable future - and a dip in demand caused by the coronavirus may only serve to strengthen automakers' commitment to the strategy.
Detroit has tried to latch onto the consumer and investor excitement over electric vehicles made by Tesla, whose market value is double that of GM and Ford combined, even though its sales are much smaller.
GM executives have been repeating a ""zero emissions"" mantra since 2017, and the company's website features a prominent commitment to its ""all-electric future."" Ford's Executive Chairman Bill Ford told the Detroit auto show two years ago: ""We’re all in on this. We’re taking our mainstream vehicles, our most iconic vehicles, and we’re electrifying them.""
But it is hard to detect a major change of direction from the companies' production plans.
According to data from AutoForecast Solutions seen by Reuters, North American production of SUV models by GM and Ford will outpace production of traditional cars by more than eight to one in 2026, and 93% of those SUVs are expected to be gas-fueled. The data has not previously been reported.
GRAPHIC: Greener vehicles: how soon? https://graphics.reuters.com/AUTOS-EMISSIONS-SUVS/0100B5LX477/index.html 
AutoForecast's data is based on planning information provided to suppliers by the automakers, and is widely used across the industry. GM and Ford executives interviewed by Reuters did not dispute the accuracy of the data. 
""GM and Ford understand that buyers want more SUVs and trucks, but they’re also trying to play to Wall Street, which thinks the future is all about electric vehicles,"" said Sam Fiorani, vice president, global vehicle forecasting at AutoForecast. ""The Detroit automakers would love to get a little of that Tesla magic and money.""

'DON'T VIOLATE THE LAWS OF ECONOMICS'
Internal production plans from other industry sources seen by Reuters support AutoForecast's numbers, which show GM and Ford expect to produce about 320,000 pure electric vehicles - powered solely by a battery - in North America in 2026. That is nearly 10 times the 35,000 they have planned to build in 2020, but fewer than the 367,500 Tesla delivered last year. 
It is only a fraction of the 5.2 million SUVs and pickups that GM and Ford expect to make in North America in 2026, according to the AutoForecast data, up 14% from 4.6 million SUVs and pickups in 2019. SUVs and pickups will account for about 87% of vehicles made by GM and Ford in the region in 2026, compared with about 82% last year.
Executives at GM and Ford told Reuters in interviews they are serious about launching more electric vehicles in the United States in the coming years, but they are concerned about getting too far ahead of mass-market demand.
""We’re trying to time this with the natural demand of consumers (so) we’re not forced to do artificial things and we don’t violate the laws of economics,” Hau Thai-Tang, Ford’s chief product development and purchasing officer, told Reuters.
GM Chief Executive Mary Barra said in early March the company planned to spend $20 billion to bring a million electric vehicles a year to market by the middle of the 2020s. A majority of those are expected to be built and sold in China, where a government mandate calls for increasing numbers of electric vehicles. 
""We want to meet customer demand with the best possible (carbon) footprint on the planet to help improve the CO2 (carbon dioxide) situation,"" said Doug Parks, GM's executive vice president of global product development, purchasing and supply chain, regarding GM's production plans for SUVs and electric vehicles in North America.

CHEAP GAS, BIGGER TRUCKS
The long-term battle between electrons and petroleum to be the primary energy source for future transportation took an unexpected turn with a crash in oil this month that sent fuel-pump prices to 20-year lows, with no signs of rising, making the cost of running internal combustion vehicles even more attractive to buyers. 
The spread of the coronavirus will put more financial pressure on automakers, according to analysts, limiting their capacity to develop and build money-losing vehicles. A global recession triggered by the epidemic ""could add strain to balance sheets and ability to fund aggressive technology shifts,"" said  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) auto analyst Adam Jonas. 
In such an environment, automakers are not looking to depart from their winning formula. 
They make more profit on each luxury SUV - such as GM's $80,000 Cadillac Escalade or Ford's $76,000 Lincoln Navigator - than they do on a dozen compact cars, according to analysts. 
Because of that, automakers are replacing compact sedans with small SUVs that share many of the car's mechanical parts, but sell for more. Ford discontinued the Focus compact sedan in the United States, which gets 31 miles per gallon of gas. Ford customers who want a similar-sized vehicle now can buy a 26 miles-per-gallon Ford Escape compact SUV, whose starting price is $6,000 higher.
That may be good for automakers' finances, but probably not for the environment.
SUVs and pickups burn more fuel and emit more carbon dioxide than comparable sedans, and those with larger ""footprints,"" - the area between the points where the wheels touch the ground - are subject to looser emissions standards.
Meanwhile, the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump is threatening to roll back tougher fuel economy and emissions standards proposed by his predecessor, Barack Obama, removing an incentive for automakers to make more fuel-efficient vehicles.
That all indicates that any overall reduction in greenhouse gas emissions enabled by new electric vehicles will be largely, or entirely, offset by the continued substitution of gasoline-fueled SUVs for cars, experts say.
The International Energy Agency (IEA) warned of this outcome in October, in a report that showed growing demand for SUVs across the world was the second-largest contributor to the increase in global carbon dioxide emissions from 2010 to 2018.
""If consumers' appetite for SUVs continues to grow at a similar pace seen in the last decade, SUVs would add nearly 2 million barrels a day in global oil demand by 2040, offsetting the savings from nearly 150 million electric cars,"" said the IEA report. The IEA declined to comment on this story.
The Obama White House predicted that doubling average car and truck fuel efficiency from 2011 to 2025 would cut greenhouse gas emissions by 6 billion tons. That does not look likely to happen. 
Trump's White House is planning to follow through on its plan to roll back the Obama rules by the end of March, administration officials have told Reuters. 

The Environmental Protection Agency, which regulates U.S. auto emissions, did not respond to a request for comment.

512,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 26, 2020 07:12AM ET</span>",Stocks - US Futures Head Lower Ahead of Jobless Claims,"By Peter Nurse    
Investing.com - U.S. stocks are set to open lower Thursday, with investors taking a cautious stance ahead of unemployment data which could vividly illustrate the economic damage caused by the outbreak of the coronavirus outbreak.
At 7:10 AM ET (1110 GMT), futures for the S&P 500 traded 25 points, or 1.0%, lower, futures for the Nasdaq down 64 points, or 0.8%, while the Dow futures contract fell 135 points, or 0.6%. 
Following days of wrangling, the bipartisan Senate unanimously passed a stimulus package to the tune of $2 trillion late Wednesday. The fate of the bill now rests with the House of Representatives, and a vote there is not expected until Friday.
The need for this stimulus is likely to be placed into plain view with the release of the weekly jobless claims report, at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT). This is set to offer the clearest evidence yet of the pandemic’s impact on the U.S. economy. 
A huge number is expected, especially after California’s state governor Gavin Newsom said Wednesday that more than a million people from his state alone had filed for unemployment this month.
“We have already got a few regional initial jobless claims, which unsurprisingly suggest a sharp increase in unemployment, as companies are shutting down and letting people go,” said analysts at Danske Bank, in a research note. 
“If jobless claims increase by the same percentage as in Ohio, national claims will increase to above 6 million.""
“Just to give another example, 11% of all employees work in the leisure and hospitality industry (including arts, entertainment, recreation, accommodation and food services) and all those jobs are in danger in the current situation,” the bank added.
U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell is scheduled to speak on NBC television around 700 AM ET, in an unusual appearance, which may provide more information about policymakers' response to the outbreak.
In corporate news, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is in the spotlight amid reports it is thinking of delaying the release of its latest iPhone model given the economic slowdown caused by the coronavirus pandemic.
Also of interest will be McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD), as the fast-food restaurant chain has decided to pull its all-day breakfast menu as it looks to make things easier for staff during this difficult period.
Additionally, investors are likely to look at Ford (NYSE:F) after S&P Global Ratings downgraded the car maker's debt to junk late Wednesday, saying the auto maker's credit metrics and ""competitive position"" were already borderline for an investment-grade rating before the coronavirus outbreak.
Oil headed lower Thursday, still under pressure as the pandemic continues to slow economic growth and oil demand, the latest blow to which came in the shape of India announcing a three-week lockdown earlier this week.
At 7:10  AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 2.8% lower at $23.80 a barrel. The international benchmark Brent contract fell 1.2% to $27.07.
Additionally, gold futures dropped 0.2% to $1,630.45/oz, while EUR/USD traded at $1.0952, up 0.7%."

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - European Union leaders will on Thursday back plans to defend healthcare, infrastructure and other firms seen as having strategic role from hostile foreign takeovers, draft EU summit conclusions show.
Listed companies worldwide have become easier targets as share prices have crashed during the coronavirus crisis, with vaccine makers and other firms that have emerged as crucial players in the fight against the virus attracting attention.
Leaders of the 27 EU states in a videoconference starting from 4 p.m. (1500 GMT) will agree to take ""all necessary measures to protect strategic assets and technology from foreign investments that could threaten legitimate public policy objectives,"" according to draft conclusions of the call.
The European Commission, the EU executive arm, issued guidelines on Wednesday to boost national defenses against takeovers.
""As in any crisis, when our industrial and corporate assets can be under stress, we need to protect our security and economic sovereignty,"" Commission head Ursula von der Leyen said.
Among the firms that should enjoy special safeguards are those active in health, biotechnology, medical research and ""infrastructures that are essential for our security and public order,"" the commission said.
Brussels promised 80 million euros ($88 million) last week to Germany-based CureVac, a biotech firm which the EU executive said had developed new technology that could slash costs for vaccines and provide a rapid response to COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus.
The move followed reports that the U.S. administration was looking into how it could gain access to the potential vaccine being developed by CureVac.
LASTING CHANGES?
Under EU rules, states can already block takeovers in strategic sectors or impose supply commitments to meet national and EU vital needs. The guidelines are meant to make sure all available protective tools are used.
EU leaders will support Brussels' guidance, which chimes with a push last year from France and Germany to relax EU competition rules and facilitate mergers of EU companies in a bid to boost their size and defenses against foreign raiders.
""This will contribute to the EU's strategic autonomy, during the crisis and afterwards,"" leaders will say, according to the draft text, in a new sign the virus emergency may have lasting effects on how the bloc functions and its global relations.
Countries are already raising their defenses. Italian Economy Minister Roberto Gualtieri said on Tuesday a national shield could cover industries deemed of strategic interest in the case of epidemic, seismic, information technology or geopolitical risks.
France has openly called for repatriating production lines that rely on global supply chains disrupted during the epidemic, which erupted in China, the world's largest manufacturer.
In a bid to reduce disruptions to supplies, EU leaders will pledge to do their utmost to strengthen the sustainability of global value chains and ""to adapt them as necessary.""

516,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 26, 2020 06:19AM ET</span>",StockBeat: Covid-19 and Things That Go Bump in the Night,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- For most of this week, the sound of Europe’s equity markets has been a high-pitched screech of brakes, as companies do their best to stop any spending that isn’t essential to survival.
Buybacks, capital spending, even dividends have been sacrificed at a giddy pace to preserve fortress balance sheet, along with events, marketing and – to judge by the latest updates from Twitter, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and U.K. broadcaster  ITV  (LON:ITV) – advertising.
But a feature of crises like the current one is that, while you can stop the steady drip of outflows,you don't banish tail risks - those potentially catastrophic low-probability, high-impact events.
Take for example the humdrum business of clearing financial transactions, a business that generates mere pennies on the billions of notional deals that it processes for banks who like earning from markets but don't like betting on their direction.
This is the kind of low-risk, low-return life to which Dutch bank ABN Amro pledged itself (under government stewardship) after its high-profile blow-up in 2008, which wrought havoc in the banking systems of north-west Europe.
At the depths of the Covid-19 rout earlier this month, ABN’s equity was trading at barely 30% of its book value, a seemingly exaggerated sell-off in the light of its low risk-profile and decent profitability: it's one of few European banks with a return on equity of 10% or more, and over half its loan book is dull, low-risk Dutch mortgages – exactly the kind of loans that you would expect to be backstopped by a fiscally strong government in a general economic emergency.
Any doubts about the bank's public standing, after a year in which historic money-laundering issues came to light, also receded after it moved quickly in the crisis to restore its public image, giving 55,000 small business customers a six-month holiday on loans up to 2.5 million euros.
But then, something went bump in the night. The bank announced on Thursday that it had made a pretax $250 million loss on a single clearing client whose futures and options strategy appears, in retrospect, to have been sub-optimal.
The client “failed to meet the minimum risk and margin requirements following extreme stress and dislocations in U.S. markets. To prevent further losses, ABN AMRO Clearing decided to close-out the positions of this client,” the bank said in a statement.
The resulting net loss of 183 million euros is nearly 60% of what the bank earned in the fourth quarter.
With a common equity ratio of over 18% at the end of last year, ABN can stomach worse losses than that without too much trouble, but even so, it’s a salutary reminder of how much can – and will – go wrong before the current crisis can be declared over. 
ABN AMRO (AS:ABNd) shares fell 5.3% by 6:15 AM ET (1015 GMT), making it the worst performer among continental European banks. The Dutch AEX was down 2.3% and the benchmark STOXX 600 was down 1.7%."

518,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 26, 2020 06:10AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Capital One got CFTC waiver after oil price plunge increased swap exposure - sources,"By Chris Prentice and Devika Krishna Kumar
WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. lender  Capital One  Financial Corp (NYSE:COF) got a waiver from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) after plunging oil prices increased the bank's derivatives exposure above a key regulatory threshold, according to two sources with knowledge of the matter.
On Friday, the CFTC said it would temporarily exempt a U.S. bank from a requirement to register as a ""Major Swap Participant"" even though its growing energy swaps exposure would technically require it to do so by the end of the next quarter. 
The CFTC did not name the bank on Friday, but the two sources told Reuters it was Virginia-based Capital One, which is best known for its retail lending and credit card business.
The regulator and Capital One declined to comment on the identity of the bank on Wednesday. A spokesman for the CFTC said it issued the waiver to protect the bank and its energy clients from undue disruption, given the unprecedented market conditions over the past month amid the coronavirus outbreak.
""We have actively encouraged all market participants to identify regulatory relief or other assistance that may be needed to help support robust, orderly and liquid markets in the face of this pandemic,"" the spokesman said.
Capital One's waiver lasts until Sept. 30, but if energy prices remain low or the bank's exposure remains above the threshold, it will register as a swap participant or make business adjustments, the CFTC said on Friday. The designation entails a number of complex and costly reporting and compliance obligations, which the CFTC spokesman said could hurt the institution's ability to keep lending. 
The bank is a relatively small player in the energy lending and financing business, with energy loans accounting for just 1.4% of its total loan book, its filings show.
As part of that business, Capital One enters into commodity swaps with its commercial oil and gas clients to help them mitigate the risk of energy price swings and the related borrowing risks. Typically, those trades do not bring Capital One's swaps exposure anywhere close to the CFTC's registration threshold, according to the CFTC's Friday notice.
But a 50% plunge in crude oil prices caused by the coronavirus and a flood of supply by top producers has seen its exposure on those swaps balloon, putting it on course to hit the threshold by the end of this month, the CFTC said. 
Broadly speaking, that threshold kicks in if a bank has $1 billion in daily average aggregate commodity swap exposure that is not secured by collateral, such as cash margin. 
Following the 2007-2009 financial crisis during which several major institutions were toppled by their derivatives exposure, Congress created a slew of swap trading laws to reduce systemic risk and increase the visibility of the market. 
Still, the decision to grant a waiver in this case has sparked worries that regulators are going too easy on banks in a bid to prop up lending, potentially exposing them to more risk down the road if energy prices do not rebound. 
Across the board, regulators have scrambled to grant regulatory relief, worried banks will pull back from lending and exacerbate corporate liquidity stress. 
""The priority of the CFTC is not to prop up an ailing sector. It’s to ensure that the market is protected from risks,"" said Tyson Slocum, a director at government watchdog group Public Citizen and a member of the CFTC's Energy and Environmental Markets Advisory Committee. 
He added he was worried the agency would give exemptions to other banks caught flatfooted by the market turmoil.

""I've got concerns with over-leveraged banks in the oil and gas sector. I don’t want this to spread across the financial sector,"" he added.

The pandemic is all but certain to tip Europe's biggest economy into recession and Chancellor Angela Merkel's government has announced measures to cushion the blow for workers and firms, including buying stakes in companies to protect them.
Scholz has made clear the state does not want to hang on to these holdings longer than necessary and will limit the acquisitions to the most extreme cases.
""When the situation has normalized we want to sell them again. We expect the economic revival to be so great that we will in part sell them making a profit so we can cover losses in other areas,"" he told the paper. 
""A second path is company bonds which funds can take over to support firms and businesses.""

The German lower house on Wednesday approved a massive stimulus package and suspended the country's constitutionally enshrined debt brake to help fund it. The package includes 100 billion euros ($109.4 billion) for a fund that can take direct equity stakes in companies, and 100 billion euros in credit to public sector development bank KfW for loans to struggling businesses.

Daily Mail and General Trust (L:DMGOa) suspended its full-year outlook as it pointed to likely damage to its events business and said 2020 performance would be worse than its existing forecasts.
Daily Mirror-owner Reach (L:RCH) expects the pandemic to hurt its advertising, print circulation and events businesses because of lower traffic, adding that outlet closures and event delays or cancellations may be necessary. It also said it expects advertising revenue deferrals.
The media company said it would only seek to give an outlook for the year in May. Unlike several other British companies, Reach said there was currently no change to its full-year dividend.
The owner of news website MailOnline said its events and exhibitions business, which accounted for 8% of the company's revenue last year, will be particularly hit if more exhibitions are postponed or canceled. But the hit to profit is expected to be partially offset by insurance coverage.

Investing.com - European stock markets pushed lower Thursday, amid concerns about the extent of the economic damage caused by coronavirus pandemic as investors still wait for action from policy makers.
At 04:05 ET (0855 GMT), the U.K.'s FTSE index was trading 2.0% lower, France's CAC 40 was down 1.6%, while the DAX fell 1.2%, all of them paring early losses. The broader based Stoxx 600 Europe index dropped 1.0%.  
The latest economic releases in Europe showed German consumer morale hitting its lowest level since 2009 while French business confidence plunged at a record pace in March, to its lowest since 2014.
The extent of the hit to Europe from the coronavirus, both in terms of lives lost and economic damage, has prompted nine European countries to call for the issuance of so-called corona bonds — a new debt instrument that would combine securities from different countries and enable more fiscally impoverished nations to obtain cash on favorable terms to combat the outbreak.
These bonds would be controversial, and attention now swings to a key conference call between the 27 leaders of the European Union later Thursday.
In the U.S., the Senate finally managed to pass a stimulus package to the tune of $2 trillion late Wednesday, and the fate of the bill now rests with the House of Representatives. A vote there is not expected until Friday.
The weekly jobless claims report, at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT), is set to offer the clearest evidence yet of the pandemic’s impact on the U.S. economy. 
A huge number is expected, especially after California’s state governor Gavin Newsom said Wednesday that more than a million people from his state alone had filed for unemployment this month.
""Markets are expecting bad news but this number will now matter a lot over the next few weeks, as being one of the key drivers of how long the U.S. economic downturn is likely to last,"" said Paul Donovan, chief economist with UBS Global Wealth Management, in a morning call.
The Bank of England hosts its scheduled March meeting later Thursday. However, the central bank has already made two emergency cuts to interest rates this month, as well as boosting its bond-buying program, and thus is likely to hold off on further action.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's financial regulators announced a welter of measures on Thursday to give companies more time to publish results and banks more leeway for handling troubled loans.
Britain's economy has gone into lockdown during the coronavirus crisis and a recession is predicted, making it difficult for companies to assess earnings.
The Bank of England's  Prudential  (LON:PRU) Regulation Authority (PRA), the Financial Conduct Authority and auditing regulator the Financial Reporting Council said the reduction in activity could be ""sharp and large"". But activity was likely to rebound sharply once social distancing measures are lifted, they forecast.
In the meantime, the measures would ensure information continues to flow to investors and the capital market keeps functioning, the three watchdogs said in a joint statement.
Bank of England Deputy Governor and PRA Chief Executive Sam Woods said in a letter to banks that ""all aspects"" of the measures put forward will need ""urgent attention"" as they finalize March/April year-end statements and first quarter reports.
""These measures are aimed at ensuring that banks are able to continue to lend to households and businesses, support the real economy, and provide robust and consistent market disclosures,"" he wrote.
Under a global accounting rule known as IFRS 9, banks are required to provision for losses on loans to businesses as soon as credit risks increase, raising fears that provisioning will balloon given large parts of the economy are at a standstill.
EXTRA TIME
Woods said it was critical banks take ""well-balanced"" decisions that also bear in mind actions already taken by government to help borrowers such as repayment holidays.
""We are thinking about what further steps could be taken to enhance the robustness of, and bring greater consistency in, the application of IFRS 9,"" Woods said.
There was a need to ""tread carefully"" and think through things afresh and in detail, he added. ""That will take time.""
The FRC measures include postponing by up to two years a requirement on companies to hold public tenders every 10 years for an auditor, a time-consuming and costly exercise.
""It addresses the difficulties companies currently face in making forward-looking judgments in their financial statements: for example, in strategic reports and viability statements, with a focus on appropriate disclosure of material uncertainties and going concern issues,"" the FRC said.
The FCA said it will allow listed companies which need extra time an extra two months - to six months after the end of their financial year - to complete their audited financial statements.
The FCA also said it would not suspend a company's listing if it published financial statements within six months of their year-end.

""We urge market participants not to draw undue adverse inferences when companies make use of the extra time our temporary relief gives them. For a great many companies it will be a sensible decision to make in unprecedented times,"" the FCA said.

NEW DELHI/MUMBAI (Reuters) - India's central bank and major lenders are considering shutting down most branches across the country to prevent tens of thousands of employees from getting infected with the coronavirus, four sources familiar with the plan told Reuters.
India is still very much a cash society and banks have been exempted from a 21-day lockdown that began this week as they are considered an essential service.
Under the plan, in major cities there would likely be only one bank open every five kilometers, the sources said, declining to be identified as it has not yet been publicly disclosed.
In the countryside, where 70% of people live and often rely only on cash, banks will likely operate on alternate days and redeploy staff to only allow disbursal of welfare cash to the poor, one of the sources said.
""The general guideline is that branch operation should largely be for villages just to take care of those people who are not familiar with digital transactions,"" a senior banker with a state-run bank told Reuters.

""Informally, banks are talking to each other to cope up with a situation where there will be some rush for cash withdrawal because it is expected the government will provide cash for the poor directly into their accounts.""

Investing.com - European stock markets are set to weaken Thursday, amid concerns about the impact on unemployment from the coronavirus pandemic as investors still wait for a massive rescue package to pass through the U.S. political process. 
At 3:15 ET (0715 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 2.2% lower. France's CAC 40 futures were down 2.7%, while the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. fell 2.5%. 
The Senate finally managed to pass a stimulus package to the tune of $2 trillion late Wednesday, and the fate of the bill now rests with the House of Representatives. A vote there is not expected until Friday.
This would represent the largest emergency aid package in U.S. history and the most significant legislative action taken to address the rapidly intensifying coronavirus crisis, which is bringing much of the U.S. economy -- still seen as the engine for the global economy -- to a halt.
The weekly jobless claims report, at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT), is set to offer the clearest evidence yet of the pandemic’s devastating impact on the U.S. economy. 
A huge number is expected, especially after California’s state governor Gavin Newsom said Wednesday that more than a million people from his state alone had filed for unemployment this month.
According to a Reuters survey of economists, initial claims for state unemployment benefits surged to 1 million for the week ended March 21, which would eclipse the previous record of 695,000 set in 1982. Estimates in the survey were as high as 4 million, which would dwarf the 281,000 applications received during the week ended March 14.

Airlines UK asked Transport Minister Grant Shapps for a six-month suspension in air passenger duty, and a waiver of air traffic control and related charges through the rest of 2020, as well as relief from EU flight compensation rules. 
""We believe a number of such measures are necessary to enable aviation both to deal with the ongoing crisis in the short-term but also to support and accelerate a strong UK recovery later in the year,"" it said in Wednesday's letter. 
The request came after Finance Minister Rishi Sunak's blow to hopes for a specific aviation rescue package when he said the government would only provide support if airlines could not raise capital from other sources, such as existing investors.
Airlines UK also said its members were desperate for more information on how to access a scheme the government said would reimburse 80% of the wage costs of furloughed workers.
""Please can we urge that further clarity is provided as soon as possible owing to the severe cash pressures that airlines are facing,"" the industry body said in the letter.

(Reuters) - Airbnb Inc on Wednesday held a phone meeting with bankers to discuss extending an existing $1 billion debt facility as the home rental start-up grapples with a slowdown due to the coronavirus, a source who participated in the meeting said. 
The deliberations echo that of many U.S. companies that have been rushing to borrow more money and boost their cash coffers as the fallout from the pandemic threatens a prolonged downturn. 
Airbnb's current debt facility was agreed in 2016 and was led by JPMorgan (N:JPM),  Citigroup  Inc (N:C),  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS), Bank of America Corp (N:BAC), Goldman Sachs (N:GS) and  Barclays  (L:BARC). 
Airbnb has never used the credit facility and it is not expiring for another year, but it is looking to extend that period to be prudent, according to the source.
Airbnb has $3 billion in cash, the person added. 
Airbnb's revenue in 2019 exceeded $4.8 billion, up 35% on year, excluding any foreign exchange impacts, and 2019 was the fourth straight year that the company was cash flow positive, according to the source. 
The company, which said in September that it planned to list its shares in 2020, had expected earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization to break even or be positive in 2020 prior to the coronavirus pandemic, he said. 
The source said Airbnb told bankers that models show the number of nights booked would recover from the current slump, reaching 2019 bookings levels again by early 2021. 
Airbnb's bookings in major cities across the world have suffered as travelers cancel trips and stay at home to protect themselves and prevent the spread of coronavirus, data from Airbnb-analytics firm AirDNA shows.
To demonstrate the resiliency of the business, Airbnb executives shared data from Puerto Rico following Hurricane Maria in 2017. 
An internal document shows the number of Airbnb listings in Puerto Rico rebounded from about 7,700 just before the hurricane, to over 8,300 one year later, and now exceed 12,000. 
Airbnb said in a blog post earlier this month that the coronavirus would impact bookings in the near-term. 
Still, Airbnb has received inquiries from potential investors who want to acquire a stake in the U.S. home rental company in the wake of the outbreak, people familiar with the matter told Reuters last week.
Two sources said the interest ranges from $100 million to $1 billion, and that Airbnb was still in ""listening"" mode.

In the United States, Airbnb said it expects its hosts to get some relief from a $2 trillion coronavirus stimulus bill that is nearing a vote in Congress.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Airbnb Inc hosts in the United States could get some relief from a $2 trillion coronavirus stimulus bill that is nearing a vote in Congress, the home-rental startup said on Wednesday.
The travel industry, including Airbnb, has been hard hit as governments worldwide impose restrictions on movement to help slow the spread of the virus, which has infected over 450,000 people across the globe and led to more than 21,000 deaths.
To relieve the economic impact in the United States, a massive federal aid bill that received bipartisan agreement on Wednesday includes temporary unemployment benefits for self-employed and gig workers during the coronavirus crisis.
In an email to Reuters, Airbnb expressed thanks to lawmakers for recognizing those who depend on income earned through renting out short-term accommodation via Airbnb's website.
Under the bill, Airbnb said hosts or hosts with family members diagnosed with COVID-19 - the illness caused by the virus - would be able to apply for unemployment assistance.
Hosts deemed sole proprietors that report Airbnb income would also be eligible for small business loans to cover interest on mortgage payments, rent and utility bills if their business is impacted by the outbreak, Airbnb said.

Hosts who use independent contractors to clean or service properties would also be eligible for those loans to pay workers, the company said.

(Reuters) - McDonald's Corp (N:MCD) said on Wednesday it would temporarily remove some items from its U.S. menu as it focuses on simplifying operations in the face of the fast-spreading coronavirus outbreak. 
Restaurants in the United States have been forced to either shut doors or limit service to delivery and takeaway, pressuring operators that are struggling with staffing and plunging traffic, among other issues.
""To simplify operations in our kitchens and for our crew ... we are working with our franchisees and local restaurants to focus on serving our most popular choices and will begin temporarily removing some items from the menu over the next few weeks,"" said Bill Garrett, senior vice president of operations for McDonald's USA in a statement to Reuters.
The world's largest burger chain, McDonald's, was also considering deferring rent and service fees for its franchisees, who operate a majority of the company's restaurants in the United States.
The U.S. restaurant industry is likely to be among the worst hit by the coronavirus pandemic, as scared customers cook at home instead of dining out and governments force restaurants to shut dining rooms and switch to drive-thru, delivery and take-out only.
McDonald's, along with peers  Yum! Brands Inc  (NYSE:YUM)'s KFC fried chicken chain and Subway sandwich shops, has also closed all locations in the United Kingdom and Ireland to contain the virus' spread.
In the past, McDonald's has discontinued a line of crafted burgers that came with unique ingredients to speed up service at the chain's drive-thru windows.

It has also routinely cut fees during major business disruptions, like a natural disaster or highway construction outside a restaurant.

But as the coronavirus curtails unnecessary human interaction, it’s hammering such businesses and rattling the foundations of Son’s SoftBank Group Corp.
In New York City, the co-working space of SoftBank-backed WeWork stands practically empty as tenants stay home for fear of infection. In Shanghai, drivers for the ride-hailing service Didi Chuxing have seen their pay plummet as customers avoid shared automobiles. In San Francisco, Dara Khosrowshahi, chief executive officer of Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc., another SoftBank investment, said “I wouldn’t put my kids in an Uber.”
Investors are increasingly spooked about the stability of Son’s empire and its $100 billion Vision Fund amid the pandemic. Before this week, SoftBank shares had tumbled about 50% in a single month, including their worst one-day decline since the Japanese billionaire listed his company in 1994. In response, the SoftBank impresario launched one of the most audacious deals of his career: sell part of  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd. and other assets to raise $41 billion to buy back shares and slash debt.
While that envisioned deal put a floor under the share price, it hasn’t changed the fundamental vulnerability of an edifice built on sharing-economy standouts that’ve been walloped since sheltering in place became the norm. SoftBank gained more than 40% since Son revealed that blueprint, which is said to include unloading $14 billion of Alibaba stock for starters. But it remains down about 30% from a February peak. In fact, Moody’s Corp. questioned the wisdom of selling prized assets into a market downturn and pushed SoftBank’s debt deeper into junk territory. SoftBank fired back by accusing Moody’s of bias.
“Right now, investments sensitive to sharing and the economy are not where you want to be, with the pandemic encouraging a stay-at-home mentality,” said Pelham Smithers, whose London-based firm offers research on Asian technology companies, in a note to clients. Companies such as WeWork, Uber and the hotel-booking Oyo “weren’t profitable when times were (relatively) good, begging the question, what will their economics look like in 2020?”

Despite the stock bounce, SoftBank’s credit default swaps -- the cost of insuring debt against default -- are still near their highest levels in a decade. The concern isn’t so much that the Japanese giant won’t be able to pay its own debts -- its cash will cover money due for at least the next two years. Rather, investors fret that Son’s 80-plus portfolio companies will struggle in the current environment, triggering negative headlines and massive writedowns.
Most worrisome for investors, Son -- who saw $70 billion wiped from his net worth in the dot-com crash -- may feel compelled to step in to support some of his startups rather than see them fail. The litany of woes surrounding SoftBank’s highest-profile startups threatens to tarnish Son’s reputation as a tech investor -- one built largely on an early bet on Alibaba before it came to dominate Chinese e-commerce, which he’s struggled to replicate.
Last year, after WeWork’s effort to go public fell apart, SoftBank stepped in to organize a $9.5 billion bailout. Son had to choose between financial aid or bankruptcy, at a time when risk aversion is straining global tech investment.
“SoftBank frustrated investors already with its assistance to WeWork last year,” said Makoto Kikuchi, chief investment officer at Myojo Asset Management Co. in Tokyo. “SoftBank owns many investments such as tech companies that get hit particularly in this situation.”
SoftBank and Vision Fund representatives declined to comment for the story.

Son did vow he wouldn’t step in to rescue any more portfolio companies after WeWork and called for more financial discipline. Among SoftBank startups, Brandless Inc. said in February it would close down while satellite operator OneWeb is mulling a possible bankruptcy filing.
“It’s unlikely that SoftBank portfolio companies will see any of that money, because the announcement was pretty clear on the purpose of the asset sale,” said Justin Tang at United First Partners. “In fact, it would be an opportune time for SoftBank to get rid of its weaker portfolio companies and stick with the leaders.”
On Wednesday, Moody’s said it will watch SoftBank and the extent to which tumbling valuations will hurt its tech-heavy portfolio. Son’s biggest bet to date has been on ride-hailing, with stakes in Uber and the leading companies in China, India and Southeast Asia. The latest to exhibit signs of trouble was European player Getaround, which is now said to be dangerously short of cash and actively seeking a buyer.
Beijing-based Didi Chuxing is another prime example of how the virus is walloping these operations. The startup, once tagged at $56 billion, had struggled to justify its valuation even before the latest crisis because of a government crackdown on its services. Ridership tumbled during the outbreak in China and Didi cut driver subsidies.
Sheng Gang, a 34-year-old Shanghai resident, said he used to earn a 36 yuan ($5) bonus for every four rides during the morning rush hour; now that’s been lowered to just 6 yuan for every three. He expects his income to drop by about half this month to around 10,000 yuan.
“I don’t have a Plan B since I just bought a new car,” Sheng said.
Wen Peng, a 35-year-old Hebei native, earned around 6,000 yuan a month as a part-time driver. But when the coronavirus hit, most people chose to stay inside and he couldn’t sustain himself. He quit in February.
“People didn’t leave their homes, almost no one wanted rides,” he said. “Many others quit for similar reasons.”
A Didi spokeswoman said ridership has rebounded significantly in recent weeks as people went back to work.
Read more: WeWork’s New Crisis: ‘Workplaces Will Never Be the Same’
WeWork is another question mark: SoftBank is said to be considering scaling back its bailout. WeWork has kept its offices open despite the virus, even while other co-working operators have closed them. That may be because revenue would disappear otherwise, just as SoftBank is trying to engineer a turnaround.
One executive who usually uses a WeWork office on Park Avenue in New York said hardly anyone shows up anymore. His WeWork representative has stopped coming to the site and works remotely. He figures customers may be canceling their leases or simply not paying, which would leave WeWork on the hook for rent owed to the landlord, Tishman Speyer. “None of us are going to the office,” he said. “But we’ve decided for now to just kick any decisions down the road for six months.”
Then there’s Oyo, which is in a particularly tricky spot. The Indian company has been expanding rapidly by guaranteeing a certain amount of revenue to hotels if they sign on as franchisees. But with few travelers anywhere, Oyo has to pay hotels even when their rooms are mostly empty.
At the Kawasaki Hotel Park in Japan, more than 400 reservations were canceled for February to April. The result was a drop in revenue of about 25 million yen ($226,000), according to Sanho Miyamoto, the owner.
“Overseas customers disappeared and Japanese businessmen halted business trips. I had to ask our employees to take a vacation for a while,“ Miyamoto said. “I am worried whether Oyo can manage because it guarantees the revenue fall for its members.”
He wouldn’t comment on arrangements with Oyo. But if the startup paid the entire shortfall, it would lose about $240,000 on a single hotel.

There’s opportunity in the downturn too. SoftBank-backed Slack Technologies Inc., a popular work communications tool among home workers, has surged following lockdowns from New York to California. And after a difficult first year in Japan, Oyo has turned to promising cash for hotels that join its platform as bookings plunged. While the company didn’t say how much it was prepared to spend, that kind of opportunism can only shorten its runway of available cash.
Investors fear that companies like Oyo have become too big to fail for SoftBank, Atul Goyal, senior analyst at Jefferies Group, wrote in a report. The WeWork rescue showed that “zero is not a floor” for any SoftBank investment and that Son is willing to throw more good money after bad, he wrote.
SoftBank may soon prove Goyal right. The company is seeking to raise an additional $10 billion so its first Vision Fund can support portfolio companies, according to people with knowledge of the matter. And the list of SoftBank portfolio firms that may soon need help also includes gym company Gympass, Getaround and travel startups Klook and GetYourRide.
“These startups are geared for high growth and high cash burn,” Goyal said. “As revenues fall, they will need further infusions of capital to keep the lights on.”

AMC's 1,000 theaters around the world were closed last week to help prevent the novel coronavirus from spreading.
""This leaves AMC with no revenue, and substantial fixed costs that continue,"" AMC spokesman Ryan Noonan said.
The furloughs apply to Chief Executive Adam Aron and other employees at the company's headquarters in Leawood, Kansas. Some workers will see reduced hours and reduced pay, while others will be cut to no hours and no pay. 
The step was ""absolutely necessary to preserve cash and to ensure that AMC can reopen our doors once this health crisis has dissipated,"" Noonan said.
Movie theaters have gone dark worldwide and some operators are worried they will not be able to reopen if the shutdown extends for months. The National Association of Theatre Owners has called on the U.S. Congress and the Trump administration to provide emergency relief.

AMC's furloughs will extend for the ""hopefully short period of time"" that all of its theaters are closed, Noonan said. Employees will retain health benefits during that time.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Billionaire investor William Ackman, who hedged his Pershing Square (NYSE:SQ) Capital management portfolio weeks ago to guard against coronavirus-inspired panic selling, told investors his private hedge fund is making money this year, an investor said on Wednesday.
The Pershing Square LP fund gained a net 6.8% this month, leaving it up 0.8% after fees for the year to date, the source said. The publicly traded Pershing Square Holdings fund is up 7.9% for the month and 0.2% for the year.
A spokesman declined to comment.
By comparison the average equity-focused hedge fund is down 15.5% for the month through Thursday, with average year-to-date losses at nearly 16%, data from Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) show.
The numbers were released just hours after Ackman wrote to investors to say he had taken off the hedges and was becoming ""increasingly positive"" on stock and credit markets.
The moves helped inoculate his portfolio from the type of losses that many hedge fund investors are bracing to see when managers finalize their March numbers next week.
Ackman earned $2.6 billion in proceeds from the hedges and said that he had reinvested most of the money in existing holdings Agilent (N:A), Berkshire Hathaway (N:BRKa),  Hilton Worldwide  Holdings (N:HLT), and Lowe's (N:LOW).
One week after taking to Twitter, television and text interviews with impassioned pleas for a 30-day shutdown of the United States to stop the virus' spread, Ackman said his outlook had brightened. Moves by states and federal and Treasury monetary helped, he said.
Performance however may remain volatile, the manager warned, saying he might have to sell recently bought holdings or go back on the defensive.

Last year his fund earned a 58% return.

539,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 25, 2020 08:05PM ET</span>",Investors look to 2008 for guidance on when to jump back in,"By Thyagaraju Adinarayan and Sujata Rao
LONDON (Reuters) - Investment banks are dusting off models from the 2008 financial crisis to gauge the right time to buy back into stock markets that have plunged 30% from their February record highs because of the coronvirus crisis.
That inflection point is not easy to model when the virus is still spreading rapidly across Europe and the United States.
But the U.S. government's $2 trillion in fiscal stimulus, coming on top of unprecedented measures from the U.S. Federal Reserve and other central banks on Tuesday triggered one of the sharpest global equity market rallies in decades. 
Wall Street's so-called fear gauge, the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) has also fallen from its highs.
For some, the signals for a reversal are in place. 
Veteran investor Bill Ackman told investors in his listed Pershing fund he had turned increasingly positive on stocks and credit, and taken off hedges he put in place in early March when markets first started cratering.
He said Pershing was ""redeploying our capital in companies we love at bargain prices that are built to withstand this crisis"".
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS)' view was that this week's record stock market rally had been led by ""underweight"" sectors, suggesting many funds had been covering short positions. Indeed, energy, travel and auto stocks were Tuesday's biggest gainers.
At  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), Andrew Sheets, head of cross-asset strategy, said in these situations, including in 2008, markets often trough well before the crisis actually ends.
From the 2008 trough there followed a decade of stunning gains that added more than $25 trillion to global equity value. 
""(The market) won't need to see a peak in U.S. (Covid) cases, it just needs to see some confirmation of the path and it nees to be happy with the path,"" Sheets said.
But so far he remains underweight credit and has only marginally upped equity exposure.
GETTING IT RIGHT
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) says there is more than one way of measuring it, especially given the unique nature of the crisis which hit the real economy first, with financial markets following.
John Normand, JPM's head of cross-asset strategy said one model suggested now is the time to re-enter -- a quarter before a recession is likely to end. His view is that the coronavirus-induced recession will be ""undoubtedly deep but also possibly the shortest-ever.""
Normand also said investors could wait for ""green shoots"" or evidence of an actual upturn -- reflected in a trough for JPMorgan's global Purchasing Managers Index.
A third, valuation-based model triggers a ""Buy"" signal when risk-premia across several asset classes fall to certain ""deep value"" thresholds.
Norman said the latter two models were not yet signalling it was time to buy.
Notably, U.S. and European stock valuations based on a 12-month forward price-to-earnings ratios now have dipped well below historical averages, according to Refinitiv data. 
Meanwhile, credit markets are still sending out distress signals -- yields on junk-rated U.S. bonds are around 10% currently compared to 6% a month ago, meaning many companies may find it hard to service debt. 
In Europe, an index of European credit default swaps,  that measure the default risk of a basket of sub-investment grade companies, is off its peaks but remains elevated at around 520 basis points, almost double end-February levels.
The volatility index's (VIX) 30% drop from recent peaks is a clear positive for riskier assets. But if 2008 is any guide, its decline may not yet signal the market trough. In 2008, the VIX retreated from highs in October, but markets took another five months to bottom out.
The recession in 2008 was a long one -- some economists reckon this time a turnaround in global growth will come by the third quarter.
Yet some also warn that markets are only now coming to grips with how severe a potential downturn could be. 
""We ... haven't fully appreciated how far this recession will go,"" said Andrea Cicione, head of strategy at TS Lombard, in London. Some of her concerns center on potential second-round effects such as rising unemployment and companies slashing their capital expenditures.
For now, the trajectory of the coronavirus and its economic fallout will play a key role in determining the market's path, said Randy Watts, chief investment strategist at William O’Neill+Co.

“In the short run, the market is still going to stay very volatile until one of three things happens - either the number of deaths and the number of new infections in the U.S., peak, there is some kind of a cure or vaccine developed or until the U.S. economy begins to reopen,"" he said.

540,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 25, 2020 07:25PM ET</span>","Coronavirus stress hits Wall Street's bonus pool, layoffs on the table","By Elizabeth Dilts Marshall and Imani Moise
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street bonuses will fall roughly 30% this year, and firms are considering layoffs to preserve profits during the coronavirus recession, according to industry insiders and bank executives. 
Alan Johnson, a compensation consultant whose predictions are closely watched by financial professionals, said on Wednesday that bonuses for 2020 could decline by as much as 40%, as the coronavirus outbreak hit markets hard and put millions of people out of work as non-essential businesses are forced to close. 
With stocks gyrating, bond investors facing liquidity strains and underwriting and merger activity all but dead, Wall Street firms are likely to cut pay for almost everyone and defer more of it to save cash, Johnson said in a report issued by his compensation-consulting firm, Johnson Associates Inc. 
People defined as “great” will likely see a 15% decline in bonuses with “meaningful” deferrals, while those considered “sub-par” will see bonuses drop 50% or more, with no deferrals and could even be terminated, the report said. 
""Now is the time to get rid of the people you probably should have gotten rid of before,” Johnson said in an interview. ""The industry has been carrying some extra weight for a while.”
Some firms are starting to discuss layoffs, executives told Reuters. 
An executive at one Wall Street bank said his division is still deciding whether to cut some staff to lessen inevitable declines in bonuses or to keep headcount steady and offer $0 bonuses to weak performers. 
Another executive from a rival firm said he expected layoffs across Wall Street in the coming months as banks contended with stalled M&A and IPO markets. ""It's really hard to support the expense base,"" he said.
That tone is a sharp reversal from the beginning of the year, when banks reported record or near-record annual profits and executives feeling optimistic about the economy began to start prioritizing business investments over cost cuts. (https://reut.rs/2BiqbuQ)
Last year the top six U.S. banks collectively increased headcount for the first time since 2011 https://tmsnrt.rs/2Jg10xe when the banks emerged from the financial crisis according to filings.
Johnson did not estimate cuts to specific businesses, but he said headcount could be reduced by up to 10% and could include retail divisions. 
The epicenter of the U.S. epidemic https://reut.rs/39nE2yt, New York, is also the center of the American financial industry. The city has nearly 18,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with some at major financial firms including JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM),  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS), BlackRock Inc (N:BLK) and the New York Stock Exchange, which is owned by Intercontinental Exchange Inc (N:ICE)."" Despite the government’s $2 trillion economic rescue package and aggressive moves by the Federal Reserve to prop up markets, economists from Goldman Sachs expect the U.S. economy to contract by 24% in the second quarter before rebounding by year's end.

Wall Street employees who change jobs are lucky compared with other workers, even they get $0 more to make the jump. That ""might reflect a very good increase,"" Johnson said.

541,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 25, 2020 07:05PM ET</span>",U.S. set to grant automakers a lifeline -- but no bailout,"By David Shepardson and Ben Klayman
WASHINGTON/DETROIT (Reuters) - The $2 trillion economic rescue package before the U.S. Senate on Wednesday would send the federal government to the auto industry's rescue for the second time in a dozen years.
Automakers are fearful of being tagged as seeking a new government bailout so soon after the 2009 government-funded auto restructurings. Detroit has not sought industry-specific assistance, instead making the case that the entire economy needs urgent access to liquidity. 
Republican Senator Pat Toomey said Wednesday the deal, which he called ""the biggest government intervention in the economy in the history of the world,"" sets aside $454 billion to make loans or loan guarantees for companies across all sectors, as well as states.
It was more likely the money will be used to leverage even more funds in loans from the Federal Reserve, said Toomey, who told reporters on a conference call that the Treasury would then be able to make loans, purchase loans or purchase corporate debt, which could be a major boost for automakers. 
Industry officials, especially at General Motors Co (NYSE:GM), were eager to avoid the appearance of a federal bailout. Sales suffered and the No. 1 U.S. automaker was nicknamed ""Government Motors"" after its $50 billion bailout in 2009.
The United Auto Workers union and the Detroit Three automakers recently discussed sending a letter to Capitol Hill explaining why the industry needed a source of liquidity, but GM ultimately declined to sign the letter and it was not sent, people familiar with the matter said. 
The final package contained no benefits targeted specifically at automakers. By contrast, U.S. airlines are set to receive $25 billion for payroll costs in cash grants that do not need to be paid back.
On Wednesday, S&P downgraded Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co to ""junk"" status, while the automaker confirmed it had drawn down its $15.4 billion credit facilities. S&P said Ford was at risk of another downgrade.
Moody's warned it was considering cutting GM to junk as it faces sharply lower demand. ""A severe disruption in automotive demand due to the coronavirus, combined with the possibility of a follow-on economic recession, will place considerable pressure on GM's cash flow and credit metrics,"" Moody's said.
Automakers do not rule out seeking additional help if sales or production remain frozen.
But auto and parts makers stand to benefit from other provisions, including a 50% employee retention tax credit and suspension of the employer share of payroll taxes for two years. GM and its employees paid more than $3.15 billion in state, local and payroll taxes in the United States in 2018. 
GM, Ford and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCA) have halted North American vehicle production until at least March 30, and people briefed on the matter said they plan to extend that into April.
Automakers will get some tax benefits, but the government loans are the biggest help, sources said. Aid will also be available to auto dealers and thousands of smaller suppliers. Funds for U.S. consumers also could stimulate new car sales again once stay-at-home orders lift. 
The Detroit auto companies are in far better financial health than they were ahead of the 2008-2009 crisis. Balance sheets at all three companies are healthier, and GM and Ford moved this month to build cash reserves further by drawing down a combined total of more than $30 billion from credit lines.
The global auto industry is bracing for worldwide sales to plummet more than 12% from 2019, worse than the two-year peak-to-trough decline of 8% during the global recession in 2008-2009, research firm IHS Markit predicted on Wednesday.
The Senate package could help badly stressed, smaller suppliers the automakers rely on for parts. 
""I'm working with four middle-market suppliers - $150 million in revenue to about $400 million in revenue - and most of these companies are not all that well capitalized,"" Steve Wybo, auto group practice leader for restructuring consultancy Conway MacKenzie, told Reuters. 
RoMan Manufacturing Inc, based in Grand Rapids, Michigan, is a family-owned manufacturer of transformers and glass molding equipment for automakers and other industries. Co-owner Bob Roth said its balance sheet is ""rock solid,"" but he is clamping down on spending as he sees other manufacturers pleading for relief from bank loans.

Normally, he said, ""we pay all bills on 10th and 25th. Now we're moving to one payment cycle a month."" He told members of the families that own the company ""we won't pay a quarterly dividend for a while.""

542,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 25, 2020 06:07PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch for March 26,"By Kim Khan
Investing.com - Congress really managed to take the wind out of Wall Street’s sales today, with some frantic selling into the close. The Dow was looking like it could add another 1,500 points to Tuesday’s haul of more than 2,100, but closed up 495.
But when it comes to the coronavirus stimulus package, the adage of buy-the-rumor-sell-the-deal seems to have transformed into buy-the-expectation-sell-execution.
It looked like the market was ready to get into the nitty gritty by tomorrow morning at the latest, but new sticking points have arisen.
If it weren’t for stimulus uncertainty, unemployment data would’ve likely been the biggest driver. And there are corporate numbers coming from the housing sector.
Here are thee things that could move the markets tomorrow.
1. Stimulus Vote (the Waiting Game)
A Senate vote on the $2 trillion fiscal package could still come tonight, but Republicans and Democrats seem to be digging in.
Three GOP Senators want to change language in the package regarding unemployment that they believe gives people an incentive to remain out of the workforce. Sen. Bernie Sanders is now demanding more strings on money for corporations if the Republican demand isn’t dropped. (They had an excellent word for this in “Too Big to Fail” if you’re looking for streaming content these days.)
Even if the Senate passed the bill tonight, the House still has to vote tomorrow. That was expected to sail through with unanimous consent, but CNN reported shortly before market close that Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez may oppose the resolution.
2. Jobless Claims to Hit Seven Figures
Weekly initial jobless claims usually get a short shrift on the data front, but tomorrow will be one of the most important ever.
The weekly claims will give the first real glimpse of the effect the Covid-19 lockdowns and closures on the employment landscape.
The Labor Department will issue the numbers at 8:30 AM ET (12:30 GMT).
Economists are expecting a staggering 1 million people claimed for first-time unemployment benefits last week, according to forecasts compiled by Investing.com. In the Reuters poll the high-end forecast is 4 million.
Claims never came in above 700,000 during the recessions in 2009 and 1982.
""Expectations are all over the map and any number we get on Thursday won't give an accurate picture of what is going on out there with downsizing decisions being discussed in corporate America as we speak,"" said Mohannad Aama, managing director at Beam Capital Management in New York.
“I worry that not only will it be a record-breaking one-week change but, even worse, just part of an historical surge in unemployment and income collapse,” Allianz (DE:ALVG) Economic Advisor Mohamed El-Erian tweeted.


3. KB Home Earnings on Tap
KB Home (NYSE:KBH) will report earnings after the bell tomorrow and details on the housing market currently will be crucial.
The stock was up 25% after an upgrade from KeyBanc Capital, but is still down 43% year to date.
KeyBanc upgraded shares to overweight from sector weight with a price target of $25.
The upgrade was based on “1) greater comfort in the policy response of key government entities; and 2) a very reasonable valuation, with book valuation (0.6x) offering a historic support basis,” Briefing.com reported.
The company is expected to reported earnings of 44 cents per share on revenue of about $959 million, according to forecasts compiled by Investing.com."
543,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 25, 2020 05:30PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Amazon pauses sellers' loan repayments amid coronavirus,"By Jeffrey Dastin and Lisa Baertlein
(Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) on Wednesday said it temporarily would not require sellers in its marketplace to repay loans it had made to them, as merchants confront the prospect of declining sales during the coronavirus pandemic.
The world's largest online retailer notified sellers that its program known as Amazon Lending would pause repayments beginning Thursday until April 30. Interest would not accrue during that period, it said. 
The program has offered sums between $1,000 and $750,000 to merchants looking for capital to acquire inventory, expand their product lines and advertise on Amazon. 
""Loan repayments will restart on May 1, 2020 ... You will have the same number of remaining payments once repayment resumes,"" Amazon said in a seller message obtained by Reuters.
More than 20,000 merchants have gotten loans from Amazon, the company said in 2017. By the end of 2019, Amazon stood to receive $863 million from sellers to whom it provided financing through the lending program, according to a company filing. The loans' terms range from three to 12 months, carrying interest rates from 6% to 19.9%.
As Americans turn to online shopping while quarantined, many online sellers, who are small and medium-sized businesses, are facing cash flow constraints amid supply chain and logistics issues caused by the outbreak. EBay Inc (O:EBAY), another major online marketplace, said on Wednesday it will defer most selling fees for merchants for 30 days.
Amazon's offer may provide relief to sellers, some of whom could be hard hit by Amazon's recent decision to restrict its U.S. and European fulfillment services to household, medical and other essential goods during the outbreak.
Merchants of popular items from toys to apparel have worried that the temporary ban on stocking goods in Amazon warehouses, on which they depend for delivery, would mean low sales and difficulty paying back loans.
Jamison Philippi, an Amazon seller of toys and video games in Hackensack, New Jersey, had estimated to Reuters his income could drop by 75% just as he had a roughly $3,500 loan payment due to Amazon on April 1.
""That's super awesome. I cheered when I got that email. That relieves a lot of stress right now,"" Philippi said. 
Amazon's move came after at least one rival offered sellers relief.
Ricardo Pero, chief executive of lending company SellersFunding, last week told Reuters he was easing terms to help sellers on Amazon and other marketplaces navigate the rapidly changing retail market. SellersFunding offers lines of credit and term loans to new and existing borrowers. Both products offer a 90-day interest-only period. 

Amazon, which had won customers by continually making shipping faster over the years, has now slowed delivery to weeks in some cases in order to manage a flood of orders. That could also dampen merchants' sales as shoppers look elsewhere for goods.

545,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 25, 2020 05:20PM ET</span>","Coronavirus exposes U.S. Uber, Lyft drivers' lack of safety net","By Tina Bellon and Nivedita Balu
(Reuters) - As independent contractors, U.S. ride-hail drivers for Uber (NYSE:UBER) and  Lyft  (NASDAQ:LYFT) benefited from soaring trip demand and flexible work hours. 
But as the coronavirus brings large parts of the country to a halt, drivers and companies are facing the downside of an ambiguous contractor model. Many Uber and Lyft drivers depend on the companies, but under U.S. labor law they do not have the protections granted to regular employees. 
Under pressure to ease the plight of its roughly 1.3 million U.S. drivers and food delivery workers, Uber has seized on the crisis to advance its campaign for a larger overhaul of U.S. employment law to permit it to offer more benefits while maintaining workers' contractor status, changes it has requested from state and federal lawmakers for several years.
Uber Chief Executive Officer Dara Khosrowshahi on Monday urged U.S. legislators to use the current crisis as an opportunity to implement changes to existing employment law by creating what the company calls a ""third way"" between employment and contractor status.
A massive federal aid bill agreed upon on Wednesday includes temporary unemployment benefits for self-employed and gig workers during the coronavirus crisis.
But Uber's proposal to change employment laws drew sharp criticism from labor unions. 
""A 'third way' is just a euphemism for creating a new underclass of workers with fewer rights and protections,"" said Art Pulaski, executive secretary-treasurer of the California Labor Federation.
In a statement, Uber said economic forecasts meant more people will need flexible, independent work in the future, which was why it wanted to raise the standard for that work.
Uber's original benefits plan did not include unemployment insurance, the protection drivers seek most. A driver advocacy group in New York on Tuesday called on Uber and Lyft to contribute to emergency unemployment pay.
Uber did not comment on the lack of unemployment insurance, saying only that its proposed model included ""extended benefits for independent contractors."" 
Lyft in a statement said the vast majority of its workers drive fewer than 10 hours per week and 80% have full or part-time jobs offering some level of benefits. Lyft said it was fighting for drivers to receive aid in the federal stimulus package, but did not comment on Uber's push for legal changes.
VULNERABLE GIG WORKERS
Demand for ride-hailing trips in recent weeks has declined by as much as 70% in some U.S. cities and many drivers told Reuters they stopped driving over fears of getting exposed to the virus or infecting others. 
Makela Edwards, an Uber driver from Oakland, California, enjoyed the steady pay and flexible hours driving afforded after leaving her job as a public school teacher at the end of 2018. Now, demand for Uber rides has all but dried up.
""This coronavirus has really lifted the lid about how vulnerable I am and how we as gig workers are being left out of the discussion,"" Edwards said.
Some drivers said they planned to apply for unemployment benefits regardless of their contractor status, hoping for more flexibility under the current circumstances.
Others said they have switched to food delivery as a more reliable source of income with roughly a third of the U.S. population ordered to stay home. Uber on Wednesday said the number of people signing up to deliver food in the United States and Canada doubled last week from the week prior but did not provide additional details.
Uber and rival Lyft have established funds to compensate drivers and delivery people diagnosed with COVID-19 or placed in quarantine by health officials for up to 14 days.
Uber said payments have started to go out, but declined to share additional details. Lyft also declined to share numbers on the payment status of those funds.
The companies have also said they would distribute hand sanitizers. But both have closed their local hubs, places where drivers can go to receive in-person help or use the bathroom, and drivers do not know where to receive disinfectants.
Uber in a statement said suppliers had prioritized orders for healthcare workers, with its orders being moved down the queue several times. The company said it would communicate a distribution plan in light of the hub closures, but did not provide additional details. Lyft said it had distributed many supplies to drivers while its hubs were still open and was working a way to distribute them now, declining to provide additional details.
Most workers' benefits, including health insurance and workers' compensation, are attached to an employment relationship, said Pauline Kim, an employment law professor at Washington University in St. Louis.

Providing contractors with added benefits such as unemployment insurance requires a change or the passage of a new law, Kim said, adding that the current crisis highlighted the gap in protection between gig workers and regular employees.

Investing.com – The Dow notched its first back-to-back wins for the first time in more than two months, despite giving up lots of its gains in late selling Wednesday as lawmakers tussled on Capitol Hill over the U.S. $2 trillion coronavirus stimulus package, denting hopes of a speedy rollout.
The Dow rose 2.39%, or 495 points, marking its second-straight session of gains for the first time since Feb. 5-6. The Dow had been up more than 1,000 points intraday. The S&P 500 rose 1.15 %, but the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.45%.
Events of Capitol Hill continued to dominate direction as ongoing disagreements over the provisions included in the stimulus package threatens fast-track voting.
Three Republican U.S. Senators, Tim Scott, Lindsey Graham and Ben Sasse said in a joint statement that legislative language included in the bill encouraged layoffs and would need fixes, Reuters reported.
But Sen. Bernie Sanders reportedly has threatened to hold up the vote on the bill and demand new restrictions on companies receiving bailouts unless the three Republican Senators drop their objections to unemployment insurance expansions, Jeffrey Stein at the Washington Post reported.
Companies that take a loan through the stimulus package, however, will be restricted from buying back their stock until one year after the loan is repaid and also will not be allowed to pay any dividends if their loan is outstanding, CNBC reported.
The rally on Wall Street was led by a standout performance from Boeing (NYSE:BA), up 24%, as investors anticipate virus-hit sectors like aviation will be rescued by the government. Boeing's surge accounted for 210.6 points of the Dow's rally today.  
Energy, meanwhile, was also in demand, driven by a 2% rise in oil prices as U.S. stimulus hopes have helped to offset concerns about falling demand amid the outbreak.
In tech, meanwhile, chip stocks gave back some of their gains from a day earlier, falling 1.6%, paced by a slump in Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) and Xilinx (NASDAQ:XLNX).
Micron jumped in after-hours trade, however, after the chipmaker topped second-quarter revenue and earnings estimates.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) fell 1% amid reports the company is preparing for a potential delay of its 5G iPhone lineup expected to be launched this autumn, Nikkei Asian Review reported, citing sources.

548,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 25, 2020 03:18PM ET</span>",Stuck-at-Home Shoppers Aren’t Using E-Commerce as an Escape,"(Bloomberg) --
The coronavirus outbreak has stalled American retailers’ e-commerce growth, sparked traffic declines and pushed many to lower quarterly guidance, according to a survey published Wednesday by CommerceNext, an e-commerce marketing and consulting firm.
Since mid-February, when coronavirus began impacting the U.S., about half of retailers said their e-commerce traffic has been trending downward. This is a concerning development for retailers that are relying on web sales for a lifeline as mandatory closures of nonessential businesses shutter wide swaths of the industry. Many of these companies, including department stores and apparel chains, have reminded shoppers that online operations are open for business.
But consumers seem uninterested, even with large portions of the population stuck at home. A majority of companies -- almost two thirds -- with stores said sales from physical locations haven’t shifted online during the outbreak, the survey found.
“It seems intuitive that if people were at home, that would lead to more e-commerce sales,” Scott Silverman, founder of CommerceNext, said in an interview. “The fact that we’re not seeing sales shift from stores to online is an indication of just general consumer uncertainty and being preoccupied with watching the news, taking care of their families and all the other things that become priorities during crisis situations.”
E-Commerce Shutdown
Supply chains have also been challenged, with executives reporting disruptions of varying degrees from the pandemic, the survey found. Retailers like Victoria’s Secret, T.J. Maxx and Marshalls have opted to shut down online operations in addition to stores.
“There are things that nobody would ever anticipate, like e-commerce shutting down,” Silverman said. “You would think that this would be the one part of their business that they could keep up in running.”
The study compiled interviews from 100 e-commerce executives at both traditional retailers and direct-to-consumer brands during March 16 and 17, which coincides with the period many retailers scaled back operations. Categories of retailers included apparel, personal care, consumer electronics and food and beverage.

550,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 25, 2020 02:55PM ET</span>",When will virus-hit markets heal? 12 charts to monitor,"By Mike Dolan
LONDON (Reuters) - Assessing the longer-term financial impact of the coronavirus spread worldwide now hinges on the success of lockdowns in containing the pandemic and trillions of dollar of support in easing the burden, thereby limiting the duration of the deep freeze and hastening any rebound. 
Since the virus exploded beyond China in early March - triggering shutdowns of the biggest economies in the world - financial markets have gone into tailspin. Stock markets lost almost a third of value, volatility spiked, credit stress soared and a dash for dollar cash worldwide amplified the anxiety.
That shock has been met with a rapid and unprecedented pushback from economic policymakers, pledging trillions of dollars to ensure containment efforts do not lead to permanent fracture of both the economy and markets that keep it moving.
Investors now need to assess whether, like China, draconian lockdowns work in stopping the virus and so limiting the length of the deliberate sudden stop in activity to the second quarter. And, in the meantime, whether gigantic government rescue programmes can prevent markets crystallizing crises of their own by choking funding, forcing bankruptcies and mass unemployment.
Following are a dozen charts that tell the story of the financial and economic crisis so far. Investors can monitor them for signs that markets are healing and seeing through the crisis:
1) The collapse of world equity indices accelerated as the COVID-19 spread well beyond China's borders and the case count continues to climb even as policy support has broken the fall of stock markets:
Graphic: Virus vs World Stocks - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/3877/3833/COVSTOCKS.png
2) The scale and speed of the market drawdown outstripped everything seen for more than 30 years as the extent of the coming recession became clear:
Graphic: Worse than the 'Great Financial Crisis'? - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/3879/3835/Pasted%20Image.jpg
3) With forecasts mounting of deep double-digit contractions of the world's major economies in the second quarter, the first business surveys to reflect the shock outside China reflected the gloom:
Graphic: Coronavirus pandemic hits global business - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/3868/3829/Pasted%20Image.jpg
4) While policy support efforts may keep many businesses afloat, the wider demand shock will hinge on how many retain their workers and avoid a mass spike in unemployment:
Graphic: Unemployment benefits claims will soon surge - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/3677/3638/Pasted%20Image.jpg
5) Critical to a calming of financial markets is preventing a spike in credit downgrades and defaults while keeping government funding channels open and cheap to ease the official backstops. As U.S. Treasury yields plumbed below 1% this month, the relative cost of credit for everyone else surged. 
Graphic: Global bond yields spike higher as US Treasury yields slide - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/3876/3832/BByields.png
6) Corporate credit concerns and a dash to draw down credit lines and secure dollar funding saw the relative cost of borrowing dollars balloon in tandem with the overall spike in volatility levels - forcing the Federal Reserve to unleash unlimited dollars into the world economy via daily and more varied swap lines with other central banks:
Graphic: Stress Seismograph - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/3874/3830/Stress%20Seismograph.png
7) The scramble for dollars worldwide has sent the dollar exchange rate sky-rocketing, amplifying the stress on a world economy with huge dollar debts:
Graphic: Dash for dollars - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/3925/3881/DOLLAR.png
8) Massive support from the Federal Reserve and via a $2 trillion U.S. government support package has helped draw a line under losses in U.S. credit funds:
Graphic: US credit shock - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/3929/3885/Pasted%20Image.jpg
9) European Central Bank and Bank of England supports alongside serial European Union and national government fiscal rescues have helped cap the surge in European credit default swap rates:
Graphic: European credit shock - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/3932/3888/euro%20credit%20shock.png
10) Emerging markets currencies have borne the brunt of the dollar surge as investors withdrew money due to the looming world recession, fears for low grade credits, the shock to world supply chains and the oil price collapse due partly to a parallel price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia:
Graphic: Emerging market currency shock - https://reut.rs/2QL5Eav
11) The scale of the investment outflows from developing economies surpass the withering withdrawal of the financial crisis of 2008/2009:
Graphic: Emerging market outflows - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/3934/3890/EMFX.png
12) For global business sectors, the hit has been near universal but some have been more damaged than others - with airlines, energy, construction and banks bearing the brunt of the hit - while defensives since as household goods, IT, healthcare, telecoms and utilties doing relatively better:

552,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 25, 2020 02:30PM ET</span>",Coronavirus-stricken U.S. companies pop poison pills,"By Svea Herbst-Bayliss
(Reuters) - More U.S. companies are rushing to adopt so-called poison pills, dusting off a nearly 40-year-old takeover defense tool to ward off hostile bidders and activist shareholders eager to exploit the coronavirus-induced market sell-off.
The S&P 500 Index has lost about a quarter of its value in the last month, as large swathes of the U.S. economy shut down and people stay at home to prevent the spread of the virus. This has made the shares of many companies cheaper and more vulnerable to approaches by corporate rivals and hedge funds.
Ten U.S. companies have announced poison pills in March, setting a record, according to FactSet Research Systems Inc and Deal Point Data LLC. Over the last 12 months through March 25, 44 poison pills have been adopted, double the number during the previous 12-month period, according to FactSet.
Poison pills prevent other companies and investors from amassing ownership stakes above a certain threshold, by authorizing the targeted company to sell new stock to its shareholders at a discount. Pioneered by corporate lawyer Martin Lipton in the early 1980s, their use can make amassing a stake in a company much more expensive.
Poison pills are often criticized by shareholders, as well as proxy advisers such as Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass, Lewis & Co, for their dilutive effect on ownership. As a result, they have been deployed sparingly by most companies in recent years, and are regarded as an emergency measure that enables the boards of targeted companies to remain in control. 
Most poison pills, which are also referred to as shareholder rights plans, are adopted for a limited time, until the takeover threat subsides. Only rarely are they exercised once announced. Nevertheless, the spike in their adoption in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak highlights how vulnerable many U.S. companies feel to hostile bids and corporate agitators after their shares nosedived, corporate governance experts said.
""Companies have been adopting poison pills at a faster pace than we have ever seen in recent years. We expect more will be coming, many more,"" said Lawrence Elbaum, co-head of law firm Vinson & Elkins LLP's shareholder activism practice. 
Oil and gas exploration and production company Occidental Petroleum (N:OXY), entertainment and restaurant company Dave & Buster's Entertainment Inc (O:PLAY), petroleum refiner  Delek US Holdings Inc  (N:DK), natural gas pipeline operator Williams Companies (N:WMB), in-flight video content company Global Eagle Entertainment (O:ENT) and gourmet food and restaurant supply company Chefs' Warehouse (O:CHEF) are companies that announced the adoption of poison pills in the last 10 days.
Occidental and Delek adopted poison pills to defend against billionaire investor Carl Icahn, while the other four companies unveiled poison pills following a plunge in their stock price, without disclosing a specific threat. All of them declined to comment or did not respond to requests for comment by Reuters.
Many companies have mobilized following warnings from their advisers.  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS) warned clients in a memo last week that cash-rich hedge funds were buying stocks in the downturn with an eye to making demands on companies later, according to one of the memo's recipients. The investment bank urged companies to discuss adopting poison pills with their lawyers. 
Law firm Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP told clients in a memo last week that, while most poison pills cap ownership of any shareholders to around 15%, ""a meaningfully lower threshold may be appropriate now.""
HEDGE FUNDS SEEKING TO CUT LOSSES 
To be sure, many activist hedge funds that had significant stakes in companies suffered losses when the stock market plunged. Yet many bought more shares following the market sell-off, lowering their cost basis in hope of offsetting or reversing earlier losses when the stocks recover. This unnerved the companies they have been targeting.
""Unlike the bedrock American companies drained by the (coronavirus) crisis, there is ample dry powder in the coffers of some funds and companies to support the continuance of activist attacks and takeover raids,"" Lipton, who is the founding partner of law firm Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz LLP, wrote in a note to clients on Wednesday. 
Among the recent examples, Jana Partners raised its stake in restaurant chain Bloomin' Brands (O:BLMN) two weeks ago to 9.2% from 7.4%. ValueAct Capital last week disclosed it increased its ownership of adventure cruises company Lindblad Expeditions Holdings (O:LIND) to 9.8% from 7.4%. Pershing Square (NYSE:SQ) Capital Holdings bought  Starbucks Corp  (O:SBUX) shares after having sold a previous stake earlier in the year, fund manager William Ackman told Reuters earlier this month. 

""Hedge funds don't see an economic crisis of epic proportions, they see an opportunity,"" said Kai Liekefett, co-chair of law firm Sidley Austin's shareholder activism practice.

553,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 25, 2020 02:26PM ET</span>",Stocks - Dow Keeps Rolling on Stimulus High,"By Yasin Ebrahim 
Investing.com – Wall Street surged on Wednesday, building on its biggest one-day rally since the Great Depression a day earlier, as investors continued their bullish bets on stocks. The White House and Congress reached a deal on a $2 trillion stimulus package to support the economy through the Covid-19 pandemic, though voting has reportedly been held up by a drafting error in the bill that encouraged layoffs.
The Dow jumped 5.35%, or 1,106 points, the S&P 500 gained 4.00% and the Nasdaq Composite added 2.26%.
The coronavirus stimulus package, which could include one-time checks worth $1,200 to Americans, tax breaks and bailouts to industries hurt by the impact from the virus such as aviation and hospitality, is expected to clear the Senate in a vote later today, with a vote in the House reportedly slated for Thursday. 
The progress on the stimulus package comes after days of negotiations after it failed to secure enough votes earlier this week.
Companies that take a loan through the stimulus package, however, will be restricted from buying back their stock until one year after the loan is repaid and also will not be allowed to pay any dividends if their loan is outstanding, CNBC reported.
Energy and industrials were among the biggest gainers on the day, putting the broader market on pace for two-straight daily wins for the first time since Feb. 5-6.
Energy, one the hardest hit sectors during the coronavirus pandemic so far, has caught a bid lately, with investors piling into beaten-down stocks in the sector such as  Valero Energy  (NYSE:VLO) and Marathon Petroleum (NYSE:MPC).
Boeing (NYSE:BA) continued its surge on expectations it would get a large amount from the stimulus package. And CEO David Calhoun has allayed fears about the company's balance sheet, insisting that the company has other options to raise funds if the government bailout comes with strings attached.
In an interview on Fox News a day earlier, Calhoun insisted that the company had plenty of alternative options to raise funds if the U.S. government demanded a stake in the company in exchange for a bailout."

555,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 25, 2020 02:18PM ET</span>",An Extra $2 Trillion? Treasury Market Says No Problem.,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- If there were ever a time for bond traders to be fearful of out-of-control U.S. deficits, it would have been Wednesday.
After all, the Trump administration and congressional leaders agreed overnight to an unprecedented $2 trillion stimulus package to help mitigate some of the economic damage caused by the coronavirus outbreak. No one is asking “how will we pay for it?” The answer is obvious: piling on to the $23.5 trillion national debt. 
 Barclays  (LON:BARC) Plc strategists Anshul Pradhan and Andres Mok were among the first to put hard estimates to the expected surge in sales of U.S. Treasuries, and the figures are as staggering as expected. The Treasury Department will have a $2.6 trillion financing need in 2020, they wrote, and about half of that will likely be covered by short-term T-bills. The net issuance of longer-term notes and bonds will rise to $1.35 trillion this year, up from about $1 trillion in 2019, and it’ll grow to $1.8 trillion in 2021. As a reminder, the largest U.S. deficit in modern history was $1.4 trillion in fiscal 2009, which shrank for five of the next six years to as little as $442 billion by 2015. It’s hard to see this gap winnowing anytime soon.
And yet, the world’s biggest bond market rallied. Benchmark 10-year and 30-year yields fell by about four basis points, settling into what appear to be their new comfort zones of 0.8% and 1.35%, respectively. A month ago, those levels would have easily represented new record lows. Even five-year notes gained, despite Barclays forecasting that “the bulk of the increase” in new debt would be around that point. A $41 billion auction of the maturity on Wednesday was strong, with the yield lower than the market indicated before the sale. The S&P 500 Index is up, so the Treasury market’s advance could hardly be chalked up to a pure bid for haven assets.
So, what’s going on? Exactly what you’d expect when a price-insensitive buyer like the Federal Reserve pledges to buy as much as necessary for the Treasury market to function normally.
It’s starting to look as if that “whatever it takes” number is going to be almost as huge as the fiscal stimulus package. “Despite unprecedented U.S. Treasury purchases as part of the Fed’s new QE program, there is little to no risk that the central bank will run out of securities to purchase,” BMO Capital Markets’s Jon Hill wrote Wednesday.
BMO agrees with Barclays that much of the deficit spike will be financed with short-term debt. That’s important because the Fed’s policy bars it from owning more than 70% of any single Treasury — soon it will need new ones to buy. “These borrowing needs will eliminate any skepticism that the Fed will be able to source securities to complete their QE purchases as the federal government will always make more USTs,” Hill said.
For now, the Fed is adding about $25 billion a day in debt due within 27 months, according to Hill. At its current pace of buying $75 billon or more a day across maturities, the central bank would add a whopping $1.6 trillion to its balance sheet in a month. The previous record for a month was March 2011, at $120 billion.
Let those last two lines sink in for a moment. The Fed is on pace to buy Treasuries in an order of magnitude 13 times greater than any other time in its history.
I wrote earlier this week about the Fed’s “infinite cash” and how it will be put to the test like never before given the huge increase in debt over the past decade. This is precisely what I meant. The U.S. Treasury market has grown to $17 trillion from less than $5 trillion around this time in 2008. Yes, foreign investors bought bonds, as did Americans in search of safe income. But in times of distress, the central bank has shown it will gobble up much of what the Treasury sells to keep the world’s borrowing benchmarks in line. It’s going back to that tried and true method in a big way to offset any incoming pressure from the federal government’s stimulus bill.
“People don’t realize: the Fed will win. The Fed has unlimited bullets,” Rick Rieder, BlackRock Inc.’s global chief investment officer of fixed income, said Wednesday. Bond traders, at least, are getting the picture.

565,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 25, 2020 01:18PM ET</span>",Is Vince McMahon Ready to Tap Out?,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Vince McMahon was once tossed into a grave and almost buried alive by the Undertaker. But that’s nowhere near as bad as the year he’s having now. 
The burial, of course, was staged, while the agony of 2020 is very real. The coronavirus pandemic has temporarily taken down the business of live sports — both real and fake. That’s left McMahon’s World Wrestling Entertainment Inc. to hold matches in empty arenas, making the spectacle feel even more theatrical than sports-like, with dramatic monologues delivered directly to the camera instead of to the shouting fans that normally line the stands. Meanwhile, McMahon’s XFL football league, which he rebooted earlier this year, had to cancel the rest of its season. XFL is privately held by McMahon; however, shares of WWE have plunged more than 40% since December.
McMahon, the 74-year-old chairman and CEO of WWE, is now looking to free up funds without relinquishing his control over the wrestling empire. On Tuesday, the company disclosed that McMahon entered into a prepaid variable forward contract, which essentially functions as a cash advance from a bank. The way it works is, McMahon agrees to eventually sell some of his shares at some future date — March 2024, in this case — receiving the money now, but without having to actually turn over the stock or pay taxes on the sale yet.
According to Bloomberg News’s Drew Singer, the bank was  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) and the deal priced 2.26 million shares at $38 apiece, representing more than $80 million in freed-up liquidity. In the meantime, McMahon gets to collect the usual dividends on those shares, and he can keep the holdings by settling the contract for cash. The agreement also doesn’t affect McMahon’s other 25 million or so class B shares, which represent just over 70% of the company’s total voting power.
Even before the coronavirus began sweeping through the U.S., WWE was having a tough year, amid a shrinking number of subscribers to its streaming-TV service, WWE Network, and setbacks with international distribution deals. After the latest earnings disappointment, McMahon fired co-presidents George Barrios and Michelle Wilson, citing “different views” on how to achieve the company’s strategic goals, in what came as a disconcerting sign to investors. 
McMahon, as revered as he is by wrestling fans — his own ring persona, Mr. McMahon, is based on the real him — he has faced some criticism lately for not keeping the franchise fresh enough. He also came under fire last year following John Oliver’s scathing “Last Week Tonight” segment on the health and treatment of WWE’s wrestlers. Notably, while other sports leagues aren’t having their teams play to protect them from the spread of the virus, WWE’s cast is still having to work — and in close contact, too. 
WrestleMania, the company’s biggest annual event, is still being held April 4-5 — though without any fans allowed to attend in person, it will lose out on important ticket and merchandise sales. Viewers can watch on the $10-a-month WWE Network app or on pay-per-view. (Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co.’s ESPN, struggling to fill its own programming schedule, has been airing WrestleMania classics.)
In bringing back the XFL, which played just one season in 2001, McMahon was hoping to inject some of the WWE flavor into a sport that he sees as dull under the National Football League’s rules and style. When he announced the XFL would return in February 2020, news stories questioned whether it would work this time, giving McMahon something to prove. Now both his babies are hurting, and his wealth is tied up in them. 
For years, WWE has been considered an attractive takeover candidate for media giants and live-events companies. It holds a ton of valuable intellectual property in its characters and story lines, which in theory leaves open a realm of possibilities for a buyer with Disney-like ingenuity, building on WWE the way Disney has with the Marvel comic books. Likewise, WWE might appeal to those looking to invest more in sports, as Fox Corp. has stated it’s doing. Media companies are also paying big sums for content with which to stock their new streaming services, such as the Peacock app being introduced next month by Comcast Corp (NASDAQ:CMCSA).’s NBCUniversal. 
McMahon has long been opposed to selling the company, wanting it to stay in the family. His daughter Stephanie McMahon manages the brand, and her husband Paul “Triple H” Levesque oversees talent and live events — both are wrestlers. The PVF contract helps protect that ownership. It may also help to have Donald Trump connections: McMahon's wife, Linda McMahon, runs the pro-Trump super PAC called America First Action, after stepping down as the president's head of the Small Business Administration last year.
That said, with money tight, the outlook for traditional cable networks souring and McMahon’s XFL passion project meeting an untimely finish once again, now may be the time for any interested buyers to take their shot.

566,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 25, 2020 01:17PM ET</span>",Coronavirus slowdown starts to rival Fed's doomsday bank stress test scenario,"By Pete Schroeder
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The unfolding market shock and economic crisis wrought by the coronavirus disruption is shaping up to be a nightmare for the Federal Reserve – literally. 
Over the past month, rapidly deteriorating economic and financial conditions have begun to rival the central bank's doomsday scenario against which it will test big banks' resilience during their annual ""stress test"" exams next month. 
Of the 16 dire domestic indicators the Fed dreamt up for this year's test, including plunging stock markets, record low Treasury yields, slumping economic growth and mass unemployment, five have been breached while others are skirting close.
The meltdown, which at one point wiped roughly $6 trillion off U.S. stock markets and clogged up short-term funding markets, is so bad that some bankers have privately grumbled that the Fed should follow its peers in Europe and the United Kingdom and scrap the tests altogether this year.
On Tuesday evening, though, the central bank moved to squash that idea, reminding banks that they will still be required to submit their stress test capital plans on April 6 as scheduled. 
""They need to understand where the banks are heading into this,"" said Tim Clark, a former senior Fed official who helped build the stress tests after the last crisis.
""The Fed needs to understand where the major pockets of vulnerability are in the system,"" said Clark. 
Since the 2008 financial crisis, the Fed has put large banks through their paces each year by testing a snapshot of their balance sheets against a hypothetical market shock. 
A central plank of the Fed's post-crisis safety and soundness regime, the tests dictate how much capital and liquidity a bank needs to go about its daily business in the eye of a storm. As the country's economic expansion continued over the past decade, the tests have gotten progressively harsher. But for the first time, reality may be worse than fantasy.
MARKET DISTRESS 
In this year's tests for example, the stock market would shed more than 25% of its value, the U.S. economy would shrink by nearly 10% in one quarter, and the unemployment rate would nearly triple to 10% in 2021. 
So far in 2020, the Dow Jones Total Stock Market Index, which the Fed uses as its stress test gauge, has already lost 25% of its value since the beginning of the year, even accounting for an 11% surge on Wednesday.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) projected on Friday, meanwhile that the U.S. economy would shrink by 24% in the second quarter, and St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard warned the jobless rate could hit 30% before the pandemic pain passes. 
That's not all. The yield on 10-year Treasury notes, a key safe-haven asset, has fallen twice as hard as the Fed envisioned, hitting a record low of 0.39% this month. It now overs around 0.8%, slightly above the 0.7% Fed's floor.
Wall Street's fear gauge, the VIX, tops 70 in the Fed’s doomsday scenario. It hit 85 earlier this month.
But this is not a cause for panic, according to Clark, who is now a banking adviser for Better Markets, an advocacy group that urges for tougher financial rules.
For one thing, 10 years of stress tests have helped push banks to more than double their common equity capital to roughly $800 billion, Fed data shows, meaning no banks failed the tests last year.
In addition, the exams don't merely ensure the banks could survive a crisis, but that they could continue to operate normally, dishing out dividends and making share buybacks.
The Fed's scenarios also envision a steep recession over 2-3 quarters, followed by a gradual recovery, whereas the present economic slump is expected to be much sharper and, hopefully, short-lived.

""They’re trying to make sure the banks have capital to withstand a variety of bad scenarios,"" said Clark.

567,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 25, 2020 01:15PM ET</span>",First UK-listed firms edge towards BoE loan scheme,"By Patrick Graham and Muvija M
(Reuters) - A handful of large British companies had emerged on Wednesday as likely candidates for the government's emergency lending scheme aimed at helping them tide over the coronavirus shutdowns afflicting many of the world's biggest economies.
The Covid Corporate Financing Facility (CCFF) aims to offset any squeeze on large private sector employers by offering firms with investment grade credit ratings easy access to 12-month loans issued as commercial paper by their banks.
Travel-food company SSP Group (L:SSPG), hammered by the virtual shutdown of commercial air travel globally, and student housing operator  Unite Group  (L:UTG) were the latest on Wednesday to signal they were likely to make use of the facility.
Power company  Aggreko  (L:AGGK), as well as bakers  Greggs  (L:GRG), a mainstay of UK high streets, and property firm NewRiver REIT (L:NRRT) have already said they expect to qualify.
The first official data on the scheme is due from the Bank of England on Thursday.
""I think a huge number of companies will apply for the scheme,"" CMC Markets analyst David Madden said.
""It should provide some much needed support to firms in these challenging times. Let's hope the process to apply for assistance is easy, and that there is a quick turnaround time too.""
UK firms have been scrambling to deal with the immediate funding pressures caused by the shutdowns, now widespread across big Asian and western countries as well as at home.
Dozens of major listed companies have canceled dividend payments, cut back on investments and pruned other areas of spending, while the government has promised to cover the bulk of wages for most British employees.
But with some dealing with an almost total collapse in revenue amid the lockdowns, their ability to secure even short-term backing from banks and creditors is unclear.
The government and the Bank of England on Wednesday told banks they must keep lending to businesses through the crisis to ensure viable companies do not fail.
Many of the hardest hit firms have already drawn down all of the credit available to them under existing agreements with banks and only a handful have unveiled deals for additional funds.
Unite, which houses 74,000 students across 177 properties in 27 university towns and cities, said it would withdraw the remaining 150 million pounds from its revolving credit facility, and was exploring CCFF as an option for additional funds if needed.
It expects a significant fall in summer bookings and would also allow any foreign students left stranded by the crisis to stay on free of charge.

SSP, on the other hand, said it was in advanced discussions with HM Treasury and the Bank of England to access the scheme.

(Reuters) - Wall Street on Wednesday was unable to sustain strong gains from the previous session as fears about the economic toll of the coronavirus pandemic overshadowed optimism from sweeping fiscal and monetary stimulus to aid businesses and households.
All three main indexes had snapped higher in early trading as Washington reached a deal on a $2 trillion economic rescue package following aggressive liquidity moves by the Federal Reserve earlier this week. 
But both set of actions failed to allay concerns the world was sliding into recession. The likelihood of corporate defaults amid a collapse in business activity returned to the forefront on Wednesday, weighing on the S&P 500 (SPX) and tech-heavy Nasdaq (IXIC) in a choppy session.
The Dow (DJI) rose 2.7%, boosted by a 27% gain for  Boeing Co  (N:BA), as sources said the planemaker planned to restart production of its grounded 737 MAX jet by May.
""There is a lack of fundamental data that we rely on as equity investors to determine what prices should be,"" said Sean O'Hara, president of Pacer ETFs, a division of Pacer Financial.
""The data that we don't have is what is the impact going to be to GDP, on earnings and how many people are going to wind up losing their job.""
Wall Street had staged a furious rally on Tuesday, with the Dow posting its best day since 1933, in wild swings that were last seen at the height of the global financial crisis.
The Senate will vote on the rescue package later on Wednesday and the House of Representatives is expected to follow soon after.

574,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 25, 2020 12:45PM ET</span>",Default fears spark up to fourfold surge in CDS trading: IHS Markit exec,"By Tom Arnold
LONDON (Reuters) - Concern that the coronavirus crisis will trigger a wave of bankruptcies globally has prompted a three to fourfold surge in the trade of credit default insurance, particularly focused on airline and travel firms, an IHS Markit official said on Wednesday.
As countries clampdown on the movement of people to contain the disease's spread, governments and businesses are facing tighter funding pressures as economic activity nosedives.
That is leading more financial institutions to bulk up on credit default insurance as a way to guard against the increasing risk of some firms and sovereigns going bust.
""In the last few weeks during this crisis period there's been a material increase in percentage volumes of CDS (credit default swaps). Daily volumes ​of CDS index trading have been up 3 or 4 times compared to non-stressed periods,"" said Gavan Nolan, director at IHS Markit, a financial information provider.
""Institutions are looking to macro hedge credit risk and CDS ​indices are the most liquid and effective instrument to hedge that risk. We are also seeing the return of idiosyncratic risk ​and an increase in single name trading, focused on airlines and travel.""
Many airlines are fighting for survival as flights are grounded because of a collapse in demand and air travel restrictions over fears of contagion. Delta Air Lines (N:DAL)  has seen its five-year CDS jump to 638 basis points, its highest level since the end of 2012.
The Markit iTraxx Europe crossover CDS index , which measures the cost of insuring exposure to a basket of sub-investment grade European companies, is at 545 bps, nearly 300 bps up from a month ago.
SOVEREIGN STRESS
Stress is also building among certain sovereigns, particularly those that were in trouble before the virus outbreak. 
In a move that will trigger payouts for holders of Lebanon's default insurance, the EMEA Credit Derivatives Determinations Committee this week ruled that a 'failure to pay' credit event had occurred after the country failed to pay principal on its $1.2 billion Eurobond due on March 9. [nL8N2BI2GK]
Lebanon will discontinue payments on all its foreign currency Eurobonds, the government said on Monday, as it struggles to overcome a months-long crisis. [nL8N2BG4CZ]
Argentina and Ecuador were also under ""extreme stress"", said Nolan, adding the former's debt was pricing in high probability of default.
""Its atypical. It would be a first to have three sovereign CDS being triggered in one year,"" said Nolan, adding that Lebanon was the first triggering of sovereign CDS since Venezuela in 2017.
The Americas Credit Derivatives Determinations Committee is determining whether a potential repudiation or moratorium has occurred on Argentina's debt. [nL8N2BG6ZY]
Ecuador will use a 30-day grace period on some bonds to delay making around $200 million in interest payments due this week, and will devote those funds toward containing the coronavirus outbreak, it said on Monday. [nL1N2BH004]

575,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 25, 2020 12:36PM ET</span>",Cuomo Says Stimulus Bill Provides ‘Drop in the Bucket’ for N.Y.,"(Bloomberg) -- The stimulus package working its way through Congress is “terrible” for New York state, the epicenter of the coronavirus pandemic in the U.S., Governor Andrew Cuomo said.
The $2 trillion in aid approved by the U.S. Senate includes $3.8 billion for New York state and $1.3 billion for New York City, Cuomo said, which he called a “drop in the bucket.” Lost tax revenue will cost Albany as much as $15 billion, he said.
Cuomo has been the chief outside-the-Beltway critic of the Trump administration’s response to the coronavirus outbreak, demanding that Trump invoke his national-security authority to speed production of ventilators and other medical equipment.
He has also said that helping New York would also help other regions of the country where the outbreak probably will flare up next.
“The apex highpoint will be sequential across the country,” Cuomo said. “We’re asking the country to help us, we will return the favor.”
Cuomo made his remarks at a news conference on Wednesday as he reported 5,146 new confirmed cases of the virus, for a total of almost 31,000. There were nearly 3,000 new cases in New York City, for a total of almost 18,000.
Some news was hopeful. The rate of hospitalizations among confirmed coronavirus patients has declined to about 12%, from a peak of 23% on March 18, Cuomo said. The decrease could be attributed partly to expanded testing.
“This is a very good sign and a positive sign. Again, I’m not 100% sure it holds or it’s accurate, but the arrows are headed in the right direction,” Cuomo said.
Cuomo has repeatedly complained that too many New Yorkers aren’t taking social distancing seriously, particularly on streets and in parks.
Authorities are experimenting with street closures in New York City so that pedestrians can keep their distance from one another, Cuomo said. They’re also mandating social distancing in playgrounds, which means no close-contact sports like basketball.
He said that law enforcement officers will be watching. “If it doesn’t happen, we will actually close down playgrounds,” Cuomo said.
The state is racing to add hospital capacity to meet a projected need of 140,000 beds. In addition to the existing 53,000 or so hospital beds in the state, another almost 30,000 will be added by retrofitting dormitories at downstate public colleges, Cuomo said.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - EU antitrust regulators have opened a full investigation into Johnson & Johnson's acquisition of Takeda Pharmaceutical's surgical patch product TachoSil, concerned that the deal could lead to reduced choice and higher prices for customers.
Takeda, (T:4502) Japan's biggest drugmaker, announced the sale of TachoSil, a surgical patch for bleeding control, to U.S. giant Johnson & Johnson's (N:JNJ) subsidiary Ethicon for $400 million last May.
The European Commission said a preliminary investigation found cause for concern because TachoSil is the market leader in Europe. Johnson & Johnson is also a major maker of surgical patches globally although it does not sell such dual patches in Europe.
The EU competition enforcer said high development costs meant rivals would find it difficult to enter the market.
""In this concentrated space, we need to carefully assess whether the proposed merger would lead to reduced choice for surgeons and patients, to higher prices for our health services, or to slower development of alternative solutions to manage problematic bleeding,"" European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said in a statement.

The Commission set an Aug. 10 deadline for its decision on the deal.

579,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 25, 2020 11:36AM ET</span>",Traders Turn From Surviving Rout to Pricing the Virus-Hit World,"(Bloomberg) -- It’s too early to say whether the sell-off is over, the stimulus is working or what the ultimate economic toll of the coronavirus will be.
But perhaps for the first time since this stock meltdown, investors have the breathing room to try to figure it all out.
Tuesday’s epic stimulus-induced rebound and easing volatility in bonds and currencies might kick off a new phase of the crisis for money managers, where the rush to liquidate exposures across the board eases.
In its place: A hunt for undervalued investing strategies over defense at all costs. Bets on corporate earnings over the medium-term. All with a calmer disposition after the waves of panic selling.
“People are beginning, at the margin, to look beyond the short term,” said Matthew Yeates, a quantitative fund manager at Seven Investment Management. “Certainly a lot of the stimulus should be inflationary and that is likely having a feed into underlying factor performance.”
Unprecedented measures from the Federal Reserve to support the economy, plus the gradual progress of law makers toward a more than $2 trillion stimulus package, are feeding optimism.
The beleaguered value trade posted its best four-day run this century as market-derived inflation expectations edged up. Volatile shares are now beating steady ones. Even much-hated highly leveraged stocks are rebounding versus the opposite cohort.
Yeates likes these kind of signals from the factor-investing world. They show that after the virus-induced shock and the liquidity squeeze, markets are moving into a less-stressed stage where investors price in the economic damage after accounting for the stimulative offset.
‘Panic Abating’
“While it is still too soon to call the ultimate trough in equities more broadly, it is encouraging that the indiscriminate fire sale, panic-driven selling appears to be abating,” BCA Research strategists Mathieu Savary and Aneel Samra wrote in a note.
Cyclicals, small caps and volatile shares are all finding favor while one measure of investor buying interest has registered its highest reading ever.
A portfolio that bets on hotels and cruise lines and against food and consumer staples has returned 23% since last Wednesday, Evercore ISI said in a note on Tuesday.
That all speaks to mean reversion, whereby extreme moves tend to return to their average, rather than any fundamental optimism about corporate leverage or beleagured cyclical business like hotels and cruise ships.
“Mean-reversion signals have been triggered across equities and credit,” JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co. strategists led by John Normand and Federico Manicardi wrote in a note on Tuesday. “Quick deratings combined with huge stimulus may explain why many investors are somewhat downplaying the unprecedented nature of the shock and instead asking when they should buy depressed markets.”
Closing Out
Still, short-covering has a lot to do with all this. A  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). basket of the most-shorted stocks has gained 15% over the past week, compared with 3% for the underlying Russell 3000.
And with quant and discretionary funds alike capitulating, they’re closing both long and short positions, one reason for the reversal in factor performance that’s proved kinder to the riskier strategies.
All that helps explain why as long as shares keep swinging, Los Angeles Capital Management, a $27 billion quant firm, is sticking to its defensive tilt. It still favors high-growth, high-quality names, according to Chief Investment Officer Hal Reynolds.
“Our models suggest that default risk is not yet subsiding,” he wrote in an email. “As credit spreads begin to tighten and interest rates stabilize, most likely following news that the virus in under control, business activity will begin to pick up which will be generally favorable to riskier assets which have been punished.”

Investing.com -- Wall Street rose in morning trading after a hesitant start as investors focused on the beneficiaries of a $2 trillion stimulus package from Congress.
The Senate is due to vote later Wednesday on the package, the biggest ever in American history, which was agreed in principle between the two parties late on Tuesday. The bill will still have to pass the House of Representatives.
At 11:17 AM ET (15:17 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was the outsize winner of then major indexes, rising 2.4%, led by Boeing (NYSE:BA), which has asked for $60 billion in government assistance. Boeing jumped 26.5%, accounting for about 180 points of the Dow's 490-point rise.
 Nike  (NYSE:NKE) aslo helped the blue-chip index, rising 10.4% after reporting a rebound in China sales after the bell Wednesday.
The S&P 500 rose 0.7%, while the NASDAQ Composite was down 0.1%. 
Stocks have also taken heart from President Donald Trump's desire to end the current wave of lockdowns across the U.S. as soon as possible. Trump said late on Tuesday that he aimed to have the economy back as close as possible to normal by Easter, which falls on April 12 this year.
That's despite the fact that the incidence of new infections and of fatalities shows no sign of slowing down yet. Data from Johns Hopkins put the number of infections in the U.S. at 55,000, already far ahead of China on a per capita basis.
Airlines, expected to get a bailout, rose as well. American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) stock was up 14% and Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) was up 12.5%.
 Target  (NYSE:TGT) stock was down 6.7% after warning that the Covid-19 outbreak was hurting sales of higher-margin discretionary goods, and also of higher operating costs for staffing and cleaning stores.

SHAREHOLDER ACTIVISTS, WATCH THAT CREDIT RATING! (1449 GMT) 
Shareholder campaigns against the strategy or the management of a company can often lead to a credit rating downgrade, an S&P global research note found. 
""We found that the credit impact of the activism was largely unfavorable, albeit only moderately so, with most related downgrades being of one notch"", the rating agency wrote. 
""Assuming the trend in 2015-2019 continues, a company subject to shareholder activism has a one-in-nine chance of seeing a rating action, with that action twice as likely to be negative as positive"", it found. 
One other interesting finding is how shareholder activism has surged in Europe since 2015.

GONE IS THE REBOUND! EUROPE FALLS BACK IN THE RED (1115 GMT) 
European stocks were on a rising trend for about 90 minutes, and then gradually fell from their peak.
Shortly before 1100 GMT, most indexes and trading centers were in the red - a very different situation from the upbeat mood this morning.
But by 1108 GMT most benchmarks are back in the black, as volatility plays with investors' nerves. 
It's currently hard to pinpoint a news headline or a precise trigger for the initial, quite gradual, reversal. There's grim news from Spain on the coronavirus front with a surge in deaths and new infections. 
Mikael Jacoby, head of continental European equity sales trading at Oddo, just told us he believes the rebound was too early and not justified by fundamentals.
Technical levels were also crossed, he noted, such as 4450 points on the CAC 40. 
""Most rebounds encourage clients to sell,"" he added.

(Reuters) -  Nike  Inc (N:NKE) shares rose 8% on Wednesday after the sportswear maker's impressive recovery in China sales offered hope that it was prepared to cope with the financial fallout of the coronavirus pandemic in other markets.
At least seven brokerages took a positive view on the stock, with some raising their price targets to as high as $95, well above its current share price of about $80.
Nike shares have fallen 28% since the start of the year on worries about a substantial dent to its sales due to the pandemic, which has also led to the cancellation or postponement of major sporting events to make matters worse for the company.
On Tuesday, Nike settled those nerves saying it was experiencing double-digit percentage growth in its digital business in China and that operations in Greater China were normalizing.
""Nike reported China revenues only down 4% in the February quarter, which is quite frankly incredible and speaks to the brand's ability to manage through macro dislocation,"" Cowen analyst John Kernan said. 
He raised his price target on Nike by $10 to $85, just a day after cutting it to $75. The median target on the stock is $92.
Analysts also believe that evidence of Nike's surge in China demand is a positive for the company's U.S. and Europe businesses, which are currently facing similar disruptions that China had encountered.
""(Nike's quarterly report) will give investors more hope around potential recovery prospects in North America & EMEA, albeit lagged,"" Piper Sandler analyst Erinn Murphy wrote in a note to clients.
Nike also beat estimates for quarterly revenue on strong digital demand, an area of focus for the company, having invested in the SNKRS app that offers limited-edition products for members. 
On a post-earnings call with analysts on Tuesday, Chief Executive Officer John Donahoe said, ""We're seeing the other side of the crisis in China ... we now have a playbook that we can use elsewhere."" 
However, adjusting for short-term pressure to the business, at least 5 brokerages cut their price target on the stock.
Still, a majority of Wall Street analysts are bullish on Nike, with 25 out of 33 brokerages rating the stock ""buy"" or higher. 

""For stock pickers, the most important learning from Nike's earnings call last night was how different the post-coronavirus demand curve will look for the most digitally sophisticated consumer brands,"" Evercore analyst Omar Saad said.

""We believe that, in the current situation, it is responsible to postpone the Annual General Meeting, to assess how the situation develops,"" said Volvo board chairman Carl-Henric Svanberg.

LONDON (Reuters) - Veteran investor Bill Ackman told clients on Wednesday that he had taken off credit market hedges and reinvested the money into new and existing stock holdings after turning ""increasingly positive"" on stock and credit markets.
Ackman, who oversees Pershing Square (NYSE:SQ) Capital Management, initially took out the hedges - credit protection on investment grade and high yield credit indices - at the start of March as panic caused by coronavirus began cratering markets globally.
In a letter to investors in his listed fund, Pershing Square Holdings Ltd (AS:PSH), Ackman said subsequent market falls combined with steps taken by governments to limit the spread of the disease and federal and Treasury monetary support, had made him more positive on the outlook.
""We became increasingly positive on equity and credit markets last week, and began the process of unwinding our hedges and redeploying our capital in companies we love at bargain prices that are built to withstand this crisis, and which we believe will flourish long term,"" Ackman said.
Ackman said the fund completed its exit from the hedges on March 23, generating proceeds of $2.6 billion, and had reinvested the money in existing holdings including Agilent (N:A), Berkshire Hathaway (N:BRKa) and Lowe's (N:LOW).

The fund also bought into several new holdings, including buying back in to Starbucks (O:SBUX). After the investments, the fund had maintained a cash position of about 17% of portfolio, he added.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are set to open a lower Wednesday, consolidating after Tuesday’s historic gains, as investors wait on the country’s lawmakers to pass a hefty stimulus package to shore up the economy against the coronavirus pandemic.
At 6:55 AM ET (1055 GMT), futures for the S&P 500 traded 24 points, or 1%, lower, futures for the Nasdaq down 77 points, or 1%, while the Dow Jones futures contract fell 101 points, or 0.5%. 
Following days of wrangling, the Senate has now reached a deal on a $2 trillion stimulus package to help ease the economic pain from the coronavirus pandemic.
The Senate will vote on the bill later on Wednesday and the House of Representatives is expected to follow soon after, although it's still not clear whether the House may try to amend it. 
Anticipation of such a deal had resulted in the Dow racking up its biggest one-day point gain ever on Tuesday, jumping 11.4%, or 2,1113 points. That was the biggest percentage gain for the blue-chip index since 1933. TheS&P 500 gained 9% and the Nasdaq Composite added over 8%.
Still, despite Tuesday’s gains, it’s important to point out that the Dow and the S&P are still on course for their worst months since 1987. The two indices have not had back to back positive days since early February.
In corporate news, Boeing (NYSE:BA) is in the spotlight on reports that it plans to restart production of its 737 MAX jet by May. The restart would end a months-long stoppage sparked by a safety ban on Boeing's best-selling jet after two crashes in Ethiopia and Indonesia that killed hundreds of people.
The sector has been hard hit by the lockdown measures needed to combat the coronavirus pandemic, and is expected to receive Federal help from the rescue package to keep airlines from folding.
Elsewhere, Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) is set to cut employee salaries by up to 30%, according to an internal memo reviewed by Reuters, as the debt-laden U.S. oil producer tries to save cash amid tumbling energy prices.
Occidental has pared spending on production, cut its shareholder dividend, dismissed staff and sold assets to avoid being overwhelmed by the debt taken on to pay for its $38 billion acquisition of rival Anadarko (NYSE:APC).
On the economic calendar, the latest release on orders for long-lasting goods are due at 8:30 AM ET (12:30 GMT). These numbers are from three weeks ago, so not from the time of severe disruption to the U.S. economy, but are still expected to show a slowdown.
Oil header lower after early gains Wednesday, ahead of the EIA weekly report, to be released at 1030 AM ET. Expectations are that they will report a build of almost 3 million barrels of crude oil.

(Reuters) -  Target  Corp (N:TGT) on Wednesday withdrew its financial outlook and said it would scale back on planned investments to focus on meeting surging demand as Americans stock up on essentials and stay home to slow the spread of the coronavirus outbreak.
The big-box retailer said it now plans to remodel only about 130 stores in 2020, down from 300, moving the rest of the projects to 2021. Target added it would open fewer small format stores than it had previously planned.
""It's become very clear that we need to be disciplined about making sure our stores and supply chain is focused on serving our guests without any unnecessary distractions,"" Chief Executive Officer Brian Cornell said.
""We'll need to prioritize the flow of food, medicine and other essentials for the foreseeable future.""
In the past few weeks, consumers have been flocking to stores to load up on canned food, disinfectants, toilet paper and other essentials as the pandemic keeps Americans confined to their homes, forcing retailers including Target to put limits on the number of items that can be bought in one shopping trip.
Cornell said demand has been ""unprecedented,"" likening the buying behavior to levels occasionally seen during natural disasters.
Target had laid out its full-year, first-quarter forecasts and investment plans for 2020 just three weeks earlier and last year announced a new share repurchase program of $5 billion. The buyback has now been suspended.
Till date in March, overall same-store sales at Target was up more than 20% from a year earlier, with sales of essentials, food and beverage up more than 50%.
The company also expects higher-than-anticipated costs, driven by an increase in pay and benefits for frontline workers, and for maintaining essential inventory.
Target, like many other retailers, has reduced store hours for cleaning and restocking and said last week it would raise the minimum wage by $2 an hour for store and distribution center workers through May 2.
Rivals such as Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) and Walmart Inc (N:WMT) have also boosted pay and gone on a hiring spree to manage a surge in orders.
The virus, which has infected more than 44,000 people in the United States leading to more than 500 deaths, has resulted in the closure of several businesses and raised concerns of a global recession.

""There is no playbook for how to react in this environment. We're writing the script each and every day,"" Cornell said.

LONDON (Reuters) - A rebound in world stocks reached a lofty 11% on Wednesday and commodities made gains too, as coronavirus-battered markets leapt on news of a $2 trillion U.S. fiscal stimulus package.
Hopes the economic devastation of the global outbreak could be alleviated gave world equity indexes (MIWD00000PUS) their first back-to-back gains in a month as volatility gauges eased away from full-blown crisis levels.
Europe's main markets in London, Frankfurt and Paris all opened 4%-5% higher after the Nikkei in Tokyo had risen almost 7% following some historic moves on Wall Street the previous day. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) had soared over 11% in its biggest one-day percentage gain since 1933 and the S&P 500 scored a 9.4% jump - its tenth best day on record out of 24,067 trading sessions since daily data started in 1927.
""The right steps have been taken but the main thing that is driving the market at the moment is sentiment,"" said Chris Dyer, Director of Global Equity at fund manager  Eaton  (NYSE:ETN) Vance.
He said it was now vital to see some positive signs on the virus itself and that health systems were not being overwhelmed. ""Market direction can change very, very quickly depending on one item of news or one development,"" he added.
The U.S. stimulus deal, billed as a $2 trillion package, is expected to include $500 billion in direct payments to people and $500 billion in liquidity assistance.
U.S. President Donald Trump had also pressed his case for a re-opening of the U.S. economy by mid-April, though that had met immediate scepticism given the rise of infections in the United States is now among the highest in the world.
In particular, its financial hub of New York City suffered another big increase in the number of infections, fuelling worries about a shortage of hospital beds.
DOLLAR DE-STRESS
In the currency markets, the dollar slipped for a third straight session as the scramble for liquidity was soothed again by the super-sized U.S. stimulus plan.
The risk-sensitive Australian dollar  jumped over the 60-cent mark for the first time in a week and euro traded up 0.4% up past $1.0835 (EUR=) in a fourth straight day of gains.
With traders moving gradually away from safety bolt holes, the Japanese yen eased to 111.34 yen per dollar  to leave it just off a one-month low.
Bond markets were also calmer. Benchmark U.S. Treasuries were yielding 0.86% while in Europe Germany's 10-year yield (DE10YT=RR) edged a basis point higher to -0.31%, tailed by other higher-rated government debt. (NL10YT=RR), (AT10YT=RR)
In Italy which remains the epicenter for the virus in Europe, Rome's 10-year borrowing costs were unchanged at 1.59%; nearly half last week's high of 3.01% (IT10YT=RR). 
In metals markets, gold changed hands at $1,610.0 per ounce , retaining its gains of almost 5% on Tuesday, its biggest jump since 2008.
Oil prices bounced another 2% as hopes for U.S. stimulus also boosted hopes for global demand. 

Brent crude futures (LCOc1) rose to $27.51 per barrel. That is up about $5, or about 13%, from their 18-year intraday low on Friday. Still on the month, the market is down 45%.

596,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 25, 2020 06:09AM ET</span>",StockBeat: Bank Stocks Flying as Tail Risks Recede,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- Europe’s battered bank stocks are flying again for a second day as the flood of central bank liquidity lifts all boats, while regulators’ reassurances on how to account for the inevitable sharp rise in distressed loans is also lending support.
By 6 AM ET (1000 GMT), the Stoxx 600 Banks index was up 5.2%, adding to Tuesday’s gain of nearly 10%. Ireland's AIB Group (IR:AIBG) shares were up 16.3% while  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) shares were up 10.3% and  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) stock was up 7.1%.
The benchmark STOXX 600 index was up 3.6% at 312.80.
Banks now have some 823 billion euro ($890 billion) worth of loans outstanding through the European Central Bank’s refinancing operations, more than at any time since 2013, after a spate of open market operations that have shown how much they need central banks’ backstops right now.
Among that increase is around $116 billion offered through a swap facility with the Federal Reserve. Banks’ demand for seven-day dollars fell sharply at this week’s auction to only $4.1 billion at an operation on Tuesday.
“We see this as an indication that whilst stress in US$ liquidity remains elevated, the ECB’s backstops have successfully reduced them,” Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) analysts led by Jernej Omahen said in a note to clients on Tuesday.
At Wednesday’s auction of seven-day funds, demand fell from $36.3 billion a week earlier to $17.3 billion, suggesting a further easing of tensions.  
There are other signs of tail risks being reduced, albeit gradually. The Eurogroup, which brings together eurozone finance ministers, inched toward activating the currency union’s 700 billion-euro bailout fund at their meeting on Tuesday.
While there’s some disappointment among periphery markets that there will be no joint debt issuance to underwrite what’s likely to be a massive widening of budget deficits, the key point is that recourse to the European Stability Mechanism further enhances the guarantee of ECB support through outright bond purchases (although last week’s new 750 billion QE program should already cover most eventualities).
Elsewhere, the European Banking Authority on Wednesday formally gave its blessing to what amounts to the suspension of accounting rules that force banks to book provisions early against loans that they expect to turn sour. The IFRS 9 rule was adopted after the last crisis to stop banks pretending that bad loans were still good, but risked making a bad situation worse if narrowly applied in the current downturn, which is of a very different nature.
“There is a broad understanding that the operational capability of banks in making in-depth assessments may be more limited under the current circumstances, hence short-term flexibility in operational requirements is warranted,” the European Banking Authority said in a statement, which gave clear precedence to meeting the immediate needs of the economy for credit.
“Given the nature of the present shock which may also have medium and long term implications the flexibility embedded in the accounting and regulatory frameworks is to be fully used by institutions to help maintain soundness through the crisis and provide critical functions to the economy,” it added.

597,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 25, 2020 05:55AM ET</span>",Few Believe in This Asian Rebound After $7.6 Trillion Sell-off,"(Bloomberg) -- 
Even a nearly 11% rally in two days isn’t quite enough to convince investors that the Asian equity market is out of the woods.
Stocks rallied in nearly every country in the region Wednesday, pushing the MSCI Asia Pacific Index to its best two-day advance since October 2008. The benchmark has bounced 10.7% since a loss on Monday, led by gains in Japan, Korea and India. The U.S. White House and Senators striking a stimulus deal and a report of China’s central bank considering a deposit rate cut were the latest sentiment boosters.
The rebound has been much sought for amid concerns over the coronavirus, which wiped out about $7.6 trillion in Asian stock market value over the past two months. Still, few are ready to call the latest splash of green a turnaround.
“A rebound doesn’t mean a market will go up in a straight line,” said Michael Liang, chief investment officer at Foundation Asset Management HK Ltd. “We may have another round of sell-off in April when companies started to announce first-quarter earnings and second-quarter guidance. Do you believe the market has fully discounted the earnings impact? I don’t think so.”
Asia’s Stock Rallies Can Be Just Bear-Market Bounces
Financial Uncertainty
Earnings estimates for members of MSCI’s Asia stock benchmark for the next year have fallen about 14% from their peak in January, compared with a 58% slump from a high during the global financial crisis.
Companies with weak balance sheets and at-risk business models may see their value “permanently impaired, and some might not survive at all,” said Eli Lee, head of investment strategy at Bank of Singapore Ltd. While unclear when things could start to improve, it’s important not to be lured in by short-term blips, Lee said.
“Market contour of the Global Covid-19 Crisis is more likely to be W- or U-shaped,” said Lee. “For those seeking opportunities after a 30% sell-off, it is time to be very careful of dangerous value traps.”

Historical data also provide a warning sign. The last time the Asian benchmark had such a strong two-day rebound -- during the 2008-2009 financial crisis -- it soon fell about 20% before bottoming.
“While the huge fiscal package agreed today is a welcome sign, the challenge ahead remains considerable,” said Tai Hui, chief Asia market strategist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Asset Management. The economic data in the U.S. and Europe have started to show the first round of economic impact from coronavirus outbreak, he said.

Encouraging Signs
That said, “recent new lows in stocks have been accompanied by either sideways or even lower volatility, indicating markets are starting to become more comfortable with the potential range of outcomes we face,” said Kelvin Tay, Asia Pacific chief investment officer at UBS Group AG’s wealth-management unit.
“Gains could be consolidated if we see more good news that containment measures are starting to rein in the spread of the virus,” Tay said.
More countries have tightened restrictions on residents as global cases topped 420,000, with India imposing a three-week nationwide lockdown. Singapore plans to shut bars and theaters in its strictest measures yet. President Donald Trump said he’s hoping to have the U.S. economy reopened by Easter next month.
“Key to watch is, with more country and city lockdowns, whether the next few weeks will see a similar containment pattern to emerge as seen in Asia/China,” said Anthony Chan, chief investment strategist for Asia at Union Bancaire Privee.

(Reuters) - European shares surged on Wednesday following a strong rally in the previous session, as investors bet on unprecedented stimulus measures to ease the economic pain on businesses and households from the coronavirus pandemic.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index (STOXX) was up 4.2%, with energy (SXEP), autos (SXAP), insurers (SXIP) and financials (SXFP) jumping between 5.4% and 6.7%.
With an 8% surge on Tuesday, swings last seen at the height of the 2008 financial crisis, the benchmark index has recovered its losses from mid March, but remains more than 25% below its record high last month.
On Wednesday, U.S. officials reached a deal on a $2 trillion package to aid small businesses and Americans hit by layoffs due to the health crisis, but with growing evidence of a breakdown in economic activity, analysts said a global recession was looming.
""It's very good that authorities came up with monetary and fiscal co-ordination, but that's only damage limitation and it doesn't necessarily help to stimulate the economy yet because we're still in a lockdown,"" said Stefan Koopman, senior market economist at Rabobank.
""Over the course of the summer, economic activity can pick up a little bit, but even then we're still way behind growth rates from 2018 and 2019. It will be a very very long year for Europe.""
European airlines, one of the worst hit sectors from travel restrictions and evaporating passenger numbers over fears of contagion, have appealed to governments for bailout packages to prevent a collapse of the aerospace industry.
Air France-KLM (PA:AIRF), British Airways-owner IAG (L:ICAG), Ryanair (I:RYA) and EasyJet (L:EZJ) gained between 7.2% and 13.2% amid the broader rebound.
German shares (GDAXI) jumped 3.7% after posting their best day since 2008 on Tuesday, while Europe's fear gauge (V2TX) fell for the fifth day in a row as a modicum of calm returned to financial markets.
""The Vix ... most certainly needs to fall below 30 and only then the real buyers return,"" said Stephen Innes, a markets strategist at AxiCorp.
""Ultimately none of that will happen until the data has bottomed and signs of life emerge around the world.""

German conglomerate Thyssenkrupp (DE:TKAG) said it would cut 3,000 jobs at its steel unit by 2026 as part of a wage deal it struck with powerful labor union IG Metall. Its shares rose 22.7% and were among the biggest gainers on the benchmark index.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Those pining for a bottom to the gut-wrenching stock market selloff may be disappointed to learn that mega one-day rallies like the historic one witnessed on Tuesday are typically not the start of a durable recovery.
U.S. stocks, that recently entered a bear market - a fall of 20% or more from recent highs - rebounded strongly on Tuesday after U.S. lawmakers said they were close to a deal for an economic rescue package in response to the coronavirus outbreak, injecting optimism to a market grappling with its biggest selloff since the financial crisis.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) soared 11.37%, its largest one-day percentage gain since 1933, while the S&P 500 (SPX) jumped 9.38% to 2,447.33, its biggest one-day percentage rise since 2008.
All the same, data suggest investors should treat the rally in stocks with caution.
Of the twenty past instances when the S&P rallied 8% or more on a single day, thirteen of them took place when stocks were in the embrace of a bear market.
(GRAPHIC: Bear market euphoria - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/3881/3837/Pasted%20Image.jpg)
""These 8% rallies are not necessarily signs of health,"" said Christopher Murphy, co-head of derivatives at Susquehanna Financial Group.
In a note on Tuesday, Murphy wrote, ""It is important to remember that some of the largest one‐day rallies in SPX's history took place during bear markets, implying that one day pops are not uncommon in a down market.""
Nor are such sharp rallies a herald of better days. 
In 2008, for instance, the two biggest gains during the market crash that fall, both in October 2008, were actually followed by five more months of double-digit declines, data showed.
""You can't take this bounce and say that (the market) will turn around next week or the week after,"" said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial (NYSE:PRU) in Newark, New Jersey.
A lot will depend on whether monetary and fiscal response can stave off a prolonged downturn, Krosby said. 
Going by history, those looking to time the end of the bear market should be more encouraged by days when investors take modest bites at risky assets rather than great big mouthfuls.

In 2009, the bull market was born with a 6.4% up day for the S&P 500. In 2002/2003 the recovery began with 3% up days.

Investing.com - European stock markets pushed firmly higher Wednesday, with investors breathing a sigh of relief that U.S. policymakers have managed to come together to deliver a massive rescue package to bolster the country’s beleaguered economy.
At 03:50 ET (0850 GMT), the U.K.'s FTSE index was trading 4.2% higher, France's CAC 40 was up 3.9%, while the DAX rose 3.0%.The broader based Stoxx 600 Europe index climbed 5%. 
U.S. lawmakers in a divided Congress have finally reached agreement on an estimated $2 trillion stimulus package aimed at shielding the U.S. economy from the worst consequences of the coronavirus pandemic, and the expectation is this deal could be passed into law as early as later Wednesday.
The necessity of further measures to bolster the world’s largest economy, which is still seen as the engine of the globe’s economy, was laid bare by a Kantar survey published Wednesday.
The survey showed that 70% of people in the G7 countries - Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States - expect their households to lose income due to the coronavirus outbreak.
In corporate news,  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) said Wednesday that its profitability has continued to improve so far in the first quarter of 2020 despite the coronavirus pandemic, but the outbreak will likely hit the bank’s results for the year. Credit Suisse shares climbed over 6%.
Shares in German conglomerate Thyssenkrupp (DE:TKAG) rose over 20% after saying it would cut 3,000 jobs at its steel unit by 2026, with no forced layoffs until March 31, 2026, as part of a wage deal struck with powerful labor union IG Metall.
Also in the spotlight, utility E.ON (DE:EONGn) said that net profit fell in 2019 and it had issued a new dividend policy through fiscal 2022 that foresees annual increases in shareholder payouts.  E.On  shares climbed over 9%.
Looking at economic data, the final German IFO business survey for March is due at 5:00 AM ET (0900 GMT). The preliminary reading last week showed a big decline, to 87.7 from 96.0, and the revised number could very well show a further drop as the coronavirus outbreak continues to hit corporate confidence.
Oil has continued its recent rally Wednesday, helped by the idea of a fiscal aid package in the U.S. Adding to the positive news was the American Petroleum Institute reporting a drop in the U.S. crude oil supply late Tuesday.
That said, the more widely followed EIA weekly report will be released at 10:30 AM ET, and expectations are that this will report a build of almost 3 million barrels of crude oil stocks.
At 3:20 AM ET, U.S. oil futures traded 3.0% higher at $24.73 a barrel. The international benchmark Brent contract rose 2.0% to $27.68.

Banks have warned they face mounting provisions as businesses they lent money to struggle to repay loans during the outbreak.

""In ESMA's view, the principles-based nature of IFRS 9 includes sufficient flexibility to faithfully reflect the specific circumstances of the COVID-19 outbreak and the associated public policy measures,"" the European Securities and Markets Authority said in a statement.

604,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 25, 2020 03:50AM ET</span>",China stocks down but more resilient than peers in virus sell-off,"By Luoyan Liu and Andrew Galbraith
SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Effective containment of the coronavirus outbreak and the promise of policy stimulus have led to Chinese stocks faring better than their global peers this year, even as foreign investors pull out of the market.
Foreign portfolio outflows from mainland markets are set to hit a monthly record, with investors rushing for the safety of U.S. dollars as global equities markets tumble.
As of Tuesday, the S&P500 index (SPX) and the MSCI world price index (MIWO00000PUS) have both slumped nearly 30% since Feb. 20, when coronavirus fears first gripped markets. By comparison, China's benchmark Shanghai index (SSEC) fell about 15% between mid-January and its trough in mid-March.

A key reason for the relative resilience of the A-share market is Beijing's effectiveness in controlling the virus outbreak and a peaking of infections on the mainland, analysts said. 
Another is the hope for more fiscal and monetary policy measures to shore up demand as Beijing strives for a speedy recovery from a likely deep economic contraction in the first quarter. 
Chinese policymakers have already implemented a raft of measures to support the economy.

The measures are expected to include more spending by local governments on infrastructure, a sector that was used by Beijing to bolster growth during the 2008 global financial crisis. 
It is essential that the authorities prop up the traditional infrastructure sector to shore up the economy, said Niu Chunbao, chief investment officer at Wan Ji Asset, a Shanghai-based private equity fund.

Another reason for the more limited losses in Chinese stocks is their lower valuations.
A-shares are relatively cheaper while their Wall Street peers were at record highs before the slump, said Fu Yanping, analyst with China Galaxy Securities.

Foreign investors have, however, been heavy sellers in the A-share market in recent weeks, as tumbling global markets and a dash for dollars forced massive liquidation of stocks, bonds and emerging market currencies. 
As of Friday, net selling by foreign investors via the Stock Connect scheme totaled about 70 billion yuan ($9.91 billion). That makes it likely March will see the biggest monthly selling since the launch of the scheme, which allows overseas investors convenient access to China's equities market. 
Consumer stocks, one of foreign investors' heaviest exposure in the A-share market, suffered steep losses in the past month. 
The outflows were exacerbated by a weaker yuan, which posted its worst week in seven months last week as the dollar surged.
Separately, Chinese funds that facilitate domestic investment in overseas stock and bond markets have been inundated by investors eager to buy on the cheap.

Investing.com - European stock markets are set to open positively Wednesday, continuing Tuesday’s sharp ride higher, on the expectation that U.S. policymakers will finally deliver a massive rescue package to bolster the country’s beleaguered economy.
At 3:20 ET (0720 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 1.9% higher. {{167|France's CAC 40 futures were up 1.6%, while the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. rose 2.1%. 
Senior Democrats and Republicans in the divided U.S. Congress said late Tuesday they were close to a deal on a $2 trillion stimulus package to limit the economic damage from the coronavirus pandemic. While it was unclear when they would be ready to vote on a bill, hope has been growing that it could be passed as early as later Wednesday.
This resulted in the Dow racking up its biggest one-day point gain, jumping 11.4%, or 2,1113 points. That was the largest percentage gain for the blue-chip index since 1933. The S&P 500 gained 9.4% and the Nasdaq Composite added 8.1%.

The necessity of further measures to bolster the world’s largest economy, which is still seen as the engine of the globe’s economy, was laid bare by a Kantar survey published Wednesday.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Qantas Airways Ltd (AX:QAN) on Wednesday secured A$1.05 billion ($627.8 million) against its aircraft fleet to help it ride out the coronavirus crisis, sending its shares soaring, as airlines in the Asia-Pacific region sliced away capacity and jobs.
Qantas raised the financing against seven of its  Boeing Co  787-9s for up to 10 years at a 2.75% interest rate, showing there is still low-cost funding available to airlines with strong fundamentals even as the global industry calls for more government aid to help replace an estimated $250 billion of lost revenue in 2020.
""Over the past few years we've significantly strengthened our balance sheet and we're now able to draw on that strength under what are exceptional circumstances,"" Qantas Chief Executive Alan Joyce said in a statement.
The airline's shares had their biggest intraday gain, rising as much as 31% before closing 26% higher. The broader Australian market (AXJO) was up 5.5%. 
Qantas has cut all international flights and put two-thirds of its 30,000 staff on leave but so far has maintained its investment-grade credit rating. 
It is continuing with a costly program to upgrade the interior of its grounded Airbus SE (PA:AIR) A380 super-jumbos, in an expression of confidence demand will eventually return to normal. 
Other airlines in the region are also looking at ways to raise cash beyond government aid. 
 Korean Air Lines Co  Ltd (KS:003490) said on Wednesday it would seek to raise funds by selling non-core assets, as it announced a pay cut of up to 50% for all of its executives.
Hong Kong's Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd (HK:0293) this month sold six 777-300ERs to BOC Aviation Ltd (HK:2588) for $703.8 million and will lease them back. 
Singapore Airlines Ltd (SI:SIAL) said on Monday it was in talks with several financial institutions over future funding needs after having drawn on credit lines.
NOT BUSINESS AS USUAL
Cash-strapped  Virgin Australia  Holdings (AX:VAH) said on Wednesday it would stop 90% of its domestic flying in addition to a freeze on international flights, and put 80% of its 10,000 employees on leave.
Virgin is also looking to close its New Zealand cabin crew and pilot bases and its pilot base for low-cost arm Tigerair Australia in Melbourne, in a sign it would not return to business as usual when demand returns.
""We plan to return Tigerair Australia and Virgin Australia to the skies as soon as it is viable to do so. However, I am mindful that how we operate today may look different when we get to the other side of this crisis,"" Virgin Chief Executive Paul Scurrah said in a statement.
Air New Zealand Ltd (NZ:AIR), which plans to cut up to 30% of its staff, has also warned it could re-emerge as a smaller airline once the coronavirus situation subsides. 
The airline said it would operate some flights to Australia, Los Angeles, Hong Kong, Shanghai and Pacific Islands through the end of May, but 95% of its international schedule had been canceled.
Other Asian carriers have slashed capacity further, with  Thai Airways  International PCL (BK:THAI) on Tuesday cancelling nearly all international flights. 
 Japan Airlines Co Ltd  (T:9201) plans to cut international flights from Japan by about 64% between March 29 and April 30.
Boeing Co's (N:BA) chief financial officer has said ""markets essentially are closed"" to new debt for the aerospace industry.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - At least two more New York Stock Exchange floor traders tested positive for the coronavirus on Tuesday despite measures taken to prevent people infected by the virus from entering the exchange while it remained physically open last week, according to a memo seen by Reuters. 
""Given the possibility of exposure, and consistent with local, state, and federal government guidance, we recommend that all those who worked on the NYSE Trading Floor over the last 14 days should self-quarantine until a two week symptom-free period has elapsed,"" Intercontinental Exchange Inc (N:ICE)-owned NYSE said in a memo to traders.
New York City, home to more than 8 million people, has become a hot spot in the coronavirus pandemic, with 157 deaths and some 15,000 cases of COVID-19 reported as of Tuesday.
The NYSE kept its trading floor open last week, screening everyone entering 11 Wall Street, but temporarily shuttered the iconic open outcry space after market close on Friday, two days after a floor trader and an ICE employee tested positive for the virus. 
At the time, the NYSE said neither person who tested positive with the virus had entered the building thanks to strict screening efforts and that it felt comfortable remaining open until the shift to fully electronic trading for the first time the exchange's 228-year history the following week.
But the traders who tested positive on Tuesday were working on the floor last week in close quarters with other traders, according to a person with direct knowledge of the situation who asked to remain anonymous given the sensitivity of the matter. 
""Those previously tested whose results remain outstanding will be notified directly by the medical team when results become available,"" the NYSE said in the memo. 
NYSE has not publicly commented on the new cases.

While the NYSE trading floor is temporarily closed over the health concerns, U.S.-listed stocks continue to trade electronically across all 13 active U.S. stock exchanges.

GOME Retail Holdings Ltd (HK:0493) and Suning.com Co Ltd (SZ:002024) plan to hand out over 620 million yuan ($88 million) worth of vouchers, while  Alibaba  Group Holding Ltd's (N:BABA) Alipay is giving away 10 million discount tokens for 10,000 retailers on its app.
JD.com Inc (O:JD) said from Thursday it will give out 1.5 billion yuan ($212 million) worth of coupons for branded goods in categories including electronics.
Even the railway authority will from Wednesday cut ticket prices by as much as 45%, while local governments such as those of Hebei, Zhejiang and Guangxi provinces are giving out vouchers for tourist attractions, cinemas and shops.
""We've launched some discounted set offers to consumers in recent days, hoping to help consumers getting back to their normal life,"" a Pacific Coffee chain spokeswoman said, referring to a coffee-and-bun deal priced as low as 20 yuan ($2.83).
The promotions reflect concern that the outbreak has depressed consumer appetite and could have a lingering impact, even as the number of new locally transmitted cases has dropped.
About 500 cinemas reopened over the weekend after being shut for almost two months but took in just 30,000 yuan ($4,245) on Saturday, local media reported.
Retail sales in the world's second-largest economy shrank by a fifth in January-February from the same period a year earlier, government data showed, during which time China began taking dramatic measures to curb the spread of the virus, shutting transport links and asking millions of people to stay home.
The government has loosened restrictions in recent weeks which is encouraging consumers to venture back into malls and restaurants, albeit amid concerns over job security and potential wage cuts brought about by a struggling economy.
""Trade, tourism catering and other services not only help to prop up an economy's growth, but also embody a city's vitality,"" financial magazine Yicai reported Zhang Jinghua, party secretary of Nanjing, as saying in early March, days before the eastern Chinese city announced it would give away 318 million yuan worth of shopping coupons in a lottery-style scheme.

He stressed the need to grasp the balance between epidemic prevention and rehabilitation and to create a safe and secure consumer environment. The city later said it believed its move boost consumption by nearly 10 million yuan in five days.

BOSTON (Reuters) - A New Jersey municipal money-market fund run by BNY Mellon Corp needed an injection of $89,000 after the market value of the fund came under pressure, the bank disclosed on Tuesday in a U.S. regulatory filing.
BNY Mellon said it provided capital support to the General New Jersey Municipal Money Market Fund on Monday. Last week, the market value of the fund, or its shadow price, dropped as low as $0.9968 per share, amid turmoil in the U.S. debt market.
It is not unusual for the market value of money market funds to fluctuate from their $1-per-share stable net asset value (NAV). But BNY Mellon's fund dropped far enough that it required the bank to file a material event disclosure with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
The fund is still paying investors $1 per share to the dollar on their investments, analysts said.
The BNY Mellon New Jersey fund is the only money fund, as of Tuesday, that had to disclose a material decline in its market value NAV, according to disclosures with the SEC.
After the 2007-2009 financial crisis, the SEC put in rules that require funds to disclose a relatively big downward move in shadow price. It serves as a pre-notification that a fund is potentially heading in the direction of ""breaking the buck"", or falling below $1 per share, even if it has not yet done so.
The disclosure is triggered if a shadow price falls below $0.9975 a share.
The $51 million New Jersey fund's shadow NAV fell to $0.9968 per share on Friday. The market NAV has since recovered to $0.9987.
But the fund was never breaking the buck, said Pete Crane, president of money-market research firm Crane Data LLC.
As long as a money fund's per-share shadow price remains in the range of $0.9950 to $1.1050, the fund can price its portfolio at a stable $1 NAV. And that means investors still receive $1 per share on their $1-per-share investment.
Shadow prices are used by the money market fund industry to show that per-share market value of a portfolio can fluctuate. Shadow prices are expected to closely track, or shadow, the stable $1 per share NAV.
The shadow price reflects the current market value of the securities the fund owns, rather than the amortized cost of those securities. SEC rules permit a money market fund to value its securities at cost and spread out, or amortize, any discounts given or premiums paid on the securities when the fund acquired them.

Foxconn, also known as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., is suspending operations until April 14, the company said in a text message to Bloomberg News. It intends to resume India production based on further government announcements. A Wistron representative said the company is also adhering to the order, while declining to comment on exactly what products are affected.
Foxconn and Wistron are key manufacturing partners to many of the world’s largest electronics names. While neither company said which products have been affected, their Indian facilities mainly crank out older iPhone models or produce gadgets primarily aimed at the domestic market.
Wistron’s Chairman Simon Lin said on an earnings call on Wednesday that he believes lockdowns in countries where the company operates, including India and Malaysia, will only be a “short-term” issue as Wistron doesn’t have labor-shortage problems there and production can be resumed quickly once restrictions are lifted.
Still, the closures underscore how Modi’s surprise announcement of a 21-day lockdown -- the most far-reaching measure undertaken by any government to curb the coronavirus pandemic -- may affect the operations of global technology giants in one of the world’s fastest-growing markets for devices.
India Locks Down 1.3 Billion People in Biggest Isolation Effort
An Apple representative didn’t provide immediate comment when contacted.
Apple has only a sliver of India’s booming smartphone market because high prices and hefty import tariffs of as much as 20% put its products beyond the reach of average Indians. But the company views the country as important for longer-term growth. The Cupertino, California-based company has an office with thousands of employees in Hyderabad, working on Apple Maps data. They too are likely to be impacted by the government’s virus-fighting measures.

614,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 25, 2020 12:00AM ET</span>",This Time May Be Different as Stocks Eye Back-to-Back Gains,"(Bloomberg) -- The best day for at least one U.S. stock gauge since the Great Depression has strategists mulling the chance of further gains.
American shares haven’t enjoyed a two-day rally since Feb. 12, and the last three surges of more than 5% in the S&P 500 Index were immediately followed by equivalent losses. But with a record surge of stocks trading on an uptick at Tuesday’s open and activity heavily skewed toward winners, Sundial Capital Research Inc. is hopeful this time could be different.
“The buying interest and close at the highs on Tuesday could be enough to finally change sentiment enough to string together some up days,” said founder Jason Goepfert in a note Tuesday. “And if buyers can do that, historical precedents argue strongly that the worst of the selling is behind us, at least for a couple of months.”
The S&P 500 jumped 9.4% on Tuesday, the most since October 2008, as Congress closed in on an unprecedented spending bill to prop up the virus-stricken U.S. economy. The Dow Jones Industrial Average surged 11.4% -- its best gain since March 1933. Dow futures were up 1.3% as of 9:20 a.m. on Wednesday, while S&P’s were 0.1% higher.
In and of itself, just two days of back-to-back gains would be a “great signal” for stocks, said Mischler Financial’s Director of International Trading, Larry Peruzzi, in recent emailed comments.
Still, there were signs investor caution remained high. While April futures on the Cboe Volatility Index fell Tuesday, a gauge of volatility on the VIX pushed higher, and investors were busy buying exposure to further price swings in index and exchange-traded-fund products, noted Susquehanna International Group LLP strategist Chris Murphy.
Meanwhile, futures on the S&P 500 edged lower in early Asia trading Wednesday.
“It is important to remember that some of the largest one-day rallies in SPX’s history took place during bear markets,” Murphy said. “One-day pops are not uncommon in a down market.”

 Ford Motor Co  (N:F) said in a statement Tuesday it was ""not planning to restart our plants in the U.S., Canada and Mexico on Monday, March 30 as originally hoped.""
Two people briefed on the matter said Ford does not plan to restart production until at least April 6 but warned it could be further delayed into April.
General Motors Co (N:GM) and  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles NV (MI:FCHA) also do not plan to resume production on March 30, three people briefed on the matter said. It was unclear when they may resume production or if some plants could restart before others.
GM declined to comment Tuesday but said last week when it announced the shutdown it would last ""until at least March 30. Production status will be reevaluated week-to-week after that.""
Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer issued an order on Monday barring non-essential businesses from operating until April 13. A spokeswoman for Whitmer was unable to clarify on Tuesday whether auto production is considered essential or not.
Michigan has declared vehicle sales by auto dealers to be impermissible under the order, but dealerships and other facilities can make repairs.
United Auto Workers President Rory Gamble said in a letter to union members on Tuesday that Fiat Chrysler had told the union that it would comply with the Michigan governor's order and had ""no plans to reopen on March 30.""
Fiat Chrysler declined to comment on the UAW letter. The UAW also said two Fiat Chrysler union members -- one in Indiana and one in Michigan -- have died after contracting the coronavirus.
Gamble's letter said the union is ""waiting to hear from GM and are demanding that they put our members’ safety first and adhere to government and health officials’ recommendations to stay-at-home.""

A group representing major U.S. and foreign automakers warned in a letter to U.S. lawmakers with other industry groups on Monday that ""Auto industry analysts are expecting sales to be down by as much as 40 percent in March compared to 2019."" The letter said 95% of North American auto plants are currently closed.

617,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 24, 2020 11:10PM ET</span>",Nike revenue beats as digital growth offsets rare China sales fall on virus hit,"(Reuters) -  Nike  Inc (N:NKE) beat estimates for quarterly revenue on Tuesday as strong digital demand offset the first China sales drop in nearly six years from the coronavirus-fueled shutdowns, but the company held back from providing a forecast due to the outbreak.
The epidemic forced Nike to temporarily shut down stores to help contain its spread in China, where it was first detected late last year. The company has now closed stores in Europe and the United States where the virus is rapidly spreading.
Governments around the world have also locked down cities and imposed stringent restrictions on travel, forcing people to turn online for their shopping needs.
""At a time when people were confined to their homes, we moved swiftly to leverage our digital app ecosystem and Nike Expert Trainer network,"" Chief Executive Officer John Donahoe told analysts on his first earnings call since taking the helm.
Digital sales climbed more than 30% in Greater China, while sales in the region, its fastest-growing segment, fell 5% due to the store closures in the reported quarter.
Overall digital sales grew 36% in the third quarter ended Feb. 29. Such sales accounted for nearly a tenth of the company's overall revenue in fiscal 2019. 
Nike's shares rose about 11% in extended trading after gaining 15% in regular hours on Tuesday. The Dow component has lost nearly 30% of its value so far this year. 
The company's reported numbers weren't disappointing, Wedbush analyst Christopher Svezia said, but the question on how the company will get through the pandemic remains.
""The curious question is, where do we stand now?""
Nike said 80% of its stores were now open in China and expected current-quarter sales to be flat in the region. 
The company said it would continue to focus on new launches, a key growth driver, despite the cancellations or postponements of several sporting events, including this year's NBA and NFL seasons and the Tokyo Olympics.
Total revenue rose 5.1% to $10.10 billion in the third quarter, beating the average analyst estimate of $9.80 billion, according to Refinitiv IBES data.
Net income fell to $847 million, or 53 cents per share, from $1.10 billion, or 68 cents per share, a year earlier, due to the hit from the outbreak and a non-cash charge related to a shift to distributor model in South America.

The S&P BSE Sensex has plunged 30% so far in March as the coronavirus-led wave of risk aversion has prompted foreign investors to dump local stocks at the fastest pace in at least two decades. The benchmark gauge is trading at 12.4 times 12-month estimated earnings, near its cheapest level since 2011.
“The fair value of a quality stock doesn’t change due to a few quarters of earnings downgrades,” said Saibal Ghosh, chief investment officer at Aegon Life Insurance. “At such attractive valuations, this is where we would like to bet our money,” he said.
Aegon has been building its portfolio with select names in the consumer and pharmaceutical sectors while avoiding companies with global links such as metals producers.
“The cash we are maintaining is more tactical and not as a hideout at a time like this,” Ghosh said. “Once the coronavirus impact starts tapering, the stocks will outperform.”
Disruption to business amid the world’s biggest virus lockdown has clouded the outlook for Indian company earnings. That unpredictability has helped drive the market into panic mode, with the Sensex’s 10-day realized volatility hitting a record of 106% on Tuesday.
“Undoubtedly, there will be some impact, but the effort from our end is to identify where the impact will be less,” said Manish Kumar, the Mumbai-based chief investment officer at ICICI  Prudential  (LON:PRU) Life Insurance Co., which manages about 1.7 trillion rupees of assets ($22.3 billion). “We are looking at good businesses across sectors.”
ICICI Prudential is carrying a “low to moderate” level of cash, and is advising clients to have a mix of both equity and debt investments to ride out the volatility.

621,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 24, 2020 08:30PM ET</span>",Lower sovereign yields to stay as global economy in recession: Reuters poll,"By Rahul Karunakar and Hari Kishan
BENGALURU (Reuters) - Major government bond yields will trade near their current lows in the coming year, foreshadowing a deep recession driven by the coronavirus pandemic, according to fixed-income analysts in a Reuters poll who said the bias was for them to drift lower. 
As global share markets crashed, traders and investors fled headlong to the safety of bonds to hedge the economic trauma from the coronavirus, pushing sovereign bond yields to record lows earlier this month.
That comes despite most central banks stepping up efforts by cutting rates and announcing unprecedented easing in emergency moves.
But since then, bond markets have also been highly erratic, as trading books were damaged from orders in markets falling to a trickle, driven by a lack of liquidity.
Still, a majority of analysts, after expecting higher yields for years, have thrown in the towel and said the most likely path over the next three months was to stay around current levels and be range bound, or fall further.
That is driven by predictions the global economy was already in a recession, according to a majority of analysts, similar to economists' expectations in a separate Reuters poll published on Friday. [ECILT/WRAP]
""The recent sell-off in U.S. Treasuries and (German) Bunds is more about a generalised rush for cash than about supply fears. For now, collapsing growth, low inflation and mega-easy monetary policy warrant low yields,"" noted analysts at  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN). 
""Volatility and liquidity were the key drivers of Treasuries, with the monetary bazooka and expectations of a large fiscal package doing little to assuage fears. We expect Treasury yields to decline as the Fed and global central banks engage in QE and other extraordinary measures to provide stimulus.""
Even the U.S. bond market, the most liquid in the world, ceased to function earlier this month, as traders sold off any asset in their possession to make up for losses elsewhere and to stock up on cash, particularly dollars.
While the Federal Reserve has announced enormous stimulus measures, financial markets have not budged.
The U.S. 10-year Treasury yield fell to 0.3% on March 9, a record low.
A separate Reuters poll of economists showed the longest U.S. expansion on record has come to an end and there was a 80% chance of a U.S. recession this year. [ECILT/US]
""We don't know how deep this is...the Fed is just pulling out all the stops throwing everything in, including the kitchen sink, and we're going to see some efforts from Washington. It is not going to prevent things from getting worse; at best it may sort of lessen the damage. But we still have to go through it in the near-term,"" said Scott Brown, chief economist at Raymond James.
""There's a lot of second and third round effects, when people start losing their jobs or they are not spending...and this really gets to the unwieldy problem with the forecast.""
The U.S. two-year, 10-year yield curve, which is closely watched as a recession indicator and flattened as far as 2 basis points earlier this month, was expected to steepen during the coming year to more than 50 basis points, which is just about double the size of a typical central bank rate change.
That part of the yield curve was briefly inverted in late August and early September. 
While U.S. 10-year Treasury yields have risen by about 50 basis points from their record lows, they were still one full percentage point lower than where they started the year. 
The consensus now is for the 10-year yield to rise 45 basis points to 1.25% in a year from around 0.8% on Tuesday. That median expectation was the lowest seen in Reuters poll records going as far back as 2002.
Just three months ago yields were expected to be around 2.0% in 12 months' time and at nearly 3.0% a year before that - which was not predicted by any analyst in the latest poll for the coming year.
""I'm not forecasting that the 10 year yield is going to get back to 3%, because we're not forecasting growth even when we're past this virus time period to rebound much more than 2% in the United States and we're not expecting inflation to take off either,"" said James Orlando, senior economist at TD Economics.
Yields on 10-year German Bunds, UK Gilts and Japanese government bonds (JGBs) were forecast to be around 10 basis points up or down from their current levels, suggesting any rise or fall for these securities would be limited.
Yields for benchmark U.S., Germany and UK bonds could drop to as low as 0.50%, -0.70% and 0.30%, respectively, in the next three months, according to the median view.

622,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 24, 2020 08:25PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Boeing plans 737 MAX production restart by May - sources,"By Eric M. Johnson
SEATTLE (Reuters) -  Boeing Co  (N:BA) plans to restart 737 MAX production by May, ending a months-long halt triggered by a safety ban on its best-selling jet after fatal crashes, people familiar with the matter said on Tuesday. 
Boeing's planning hinges on the scale of disruptions from the fast spreading coronavirus, and U.S. regulators clearing the 737 MAX to return to service, a milestone Boeing still expects to reach in mid-2020. 
One industry source said Boeing has asked some suppliers to be ready to ship 737 parts in April. Another person said production was planned to restart in May. A third person said coronavirus is throwing a wrench in Boeing's plans - they had initially hoped for April, but that fell to May. 
""It'll be a very slow, methodical, systematic approach to warming the line up, and getting crews back in place,"" Boeing Chief Financial Officer Greg Smith told Reuters on Tuesday when asked about the May restart goal. 
""Priority number 1 is getting customers' fleets back up,"" Smith said, adding that a production ramp up will be paired with clearing the MAX backlog. ""We don't want to add to inventory.""
Boeing ceased production of the jet in January as it struggled to win regulatory approvals and accrued a backlog of 400 undelivered jets.
The coronavirus pandemic has shattered global travel demand, upended lives for millions and wiped billions off Boeing's market value, compounding a year-old crisis over the grounding of the 737 MAX after crashes in Ethiopia and Indonesia killed 346 people.
Boeing said on Monday that it would halt production in its Washington state facilities, beginning on Wednesday, to reduce coronavirus risks. 
Boeing has reported dozens of cases across its Seattle-area facilities, many of which were at its Everett hub north of Seattle. One worker died from the coronavirus, according to a friend's Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) tribute on Monday. 
Boeing has told suppliers to halt shipments to its Seattle-area facilities, and has frozen hiring among other cash-saving measures.
Boeing is seeking $60 billion in U.S. government aid to prop up its finances and the embattled American aerospace supply chain. 

Boeing has used the production lull to curb inefficiencies, improve quality and ease the plane's re-entry to the market.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Several investors who push management to perform better are trying to raise hundreds of millions of dollars in new cash to buy stakes in companies beaten down by a historic market selloff, four people familiar with their plans said on Tuesday.
Glenn Welling, who runs the $1.1 billion Engaged Capital, wants to raise as much as $250 million in fresh money while Jonathan Litt's $500 million Land & Buildings Investment Management is creating a new vehicle and will take however much money clients are ready to commit, the people said.
Litt, who specializes in real estate investments, wants to snap up companies with strong balance sheets that are trading at large discounts and own data centers, warehouses and lab space, for example.
He and his investment team will host a conference call on Wednesday to discuss the opportunities in public real estate being created by the COVID-19 sell-off.
Welling, who often wins board seats and calls for his target companies to sell themselves, has approached only existing investors, according to the sources, who said he told them that he wants to buy more stock in names he already owns. He may also go after new targets but he did not name them, according to the sources.
Panic selling, sparked by fear about the spreading coronavirus, has driven the S&P 500 index (SPX) down some 30% since January. For activists it is creating a buying opportunity, said fund managers and lawyers.
Companies that were too expensive might now be attractive. ""For activists the dinosaur targets are no longer insurmountable,"" said Lawrence Elbaum, who co-heads law firm Vinson & Elkins' shareholder activism practice.
Engaged's three largest investments at the end of 2019 were  Hain Celestial Group  Inc (O:HAIN),  Rent-A-Center Inc  (O:RCII) and Medifast Inc (N:MED) Medifast's stock has tumbled 42% since January while Rent-A-Center's stock is down 51%.
Other activists, including William Ackman's Pershing Square (NYSE:SQ) Capital Management and Carl Icahn, have also bought more stock in companies they owned. They did raise new capital from investors, however.
As some activist managers approach potential investors for new money, it may not be a hard sell.
""Putting new capital to work today where one could influence the outcome by being on the board or an active large shareholder is an ideal way to invest during this dislocation,"" said Gregg Hymowitz, chief executive of EnTrust Global, a big investor with activists. ""We are actively looking at multiple situations although the underwriting is fluid, to say the least.""

(Reuters) - The Dow soared on Tuesday to its biggest one-day percentage gain since 1933, after U.S. lawmakers said they were close to a deal for an economic rescue package in response to the coronavirus outbreak, injecting optimism following the biggest selloff since the financial crisis.
All three main U.S. stock indexes rebounded strongly from Monday's brutal selloff as the coronavirus outbreak forced entire nations to shut down. 
Senior Democrats and Republicans said they were close to a deal on a $2 trillion stimulus bill, aimed at providing financial aid to Americans out of work and help for distressed industries.
The expected legislation adds to aggressive action announced by the Federal Reserve in recent days, including purchase of corporate bonds and announcing that the U.S. central bank will make direct loans to companies. 
King Lip, chief investment strategist at Baker Avenue Asset Management in San Francisco, said expectations on the stimulus bill were driving optimism on Wall Street, but said his firm was still waiting to buy back into the market.
""With all of this stimulus, we just need a catalyst to spark the fire,"" Lip said. ""That spark will be a peaking of the cases, and when it starts to come down, I think that's when everything gets lit up.""
Investors were also pleased after President Donald Trump said on Monday he was considering how to restart parts of business life when a 15-day shutdown ends next week, even as the highly contagious virus spreads rapidly and poorly equipped hospitals struggle with a wave of deadly cases.
A separate proposal in the U.S. House of Representatives to grant airlines and contractors a $40 billion bailout lifted the S&P 1500 airlines index <.SPCOMAIR> by 15%.
The severity of the spread of COVID-19 and expectations of aggressive stimulus measures have whipsawed financial markets and ended Wall Street's 11-year bull run.
 Boeing Co  (N:BA) powered the Dow's gains, jumping nearly 21% after Chief Executive Dave Calhoun said the planemaker expected the 737 MAX jet to return to service by mid-year. Its shares have lost nearly two-thirds of their value so far in 2020.
Data on Monday showed U.S. business activity hit a record low in March, bolstering expert views that the economy was already in a recession.
Traders were still weighing the uncertainty of the path of the coronavirus outbreak.
""We don't know how long it's going to take to peak. We don't know how to treat it. We don't have a vaccine. So all of those uncertainties are causing a myriad of aftershocks,"" said Nancy Perez, senior portfolio manager at Boston Private Wealth in Miami.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) soared 11.37% to end at 20,704.91 points, while the S&P 500 (SPX) jumped 9.38% to 2,447.33. The Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) rallied 8.12% to 7,417.86.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Large banks should still submit the capital plans they have drawn up for the Federal Reserve's annual stress tests by the original April 6 deadline, the central bank said on Tuesday.
In a statement, the Fed said those plans will be used to ""monitor how firms are managing their capital in the current environment.""
At the same time, the Fed said it will give banks more time to address non-critical examiner issues and will temporarily reduce examination activities at banks. Instead, the Fed is currently focused on bank outreach to make sure firms can manage the challenge and risks brought on by the pandemic.
""The Board recognizes that the current situation is significantly affecting areas of the country in different ways and will work with financial institutions to understand the specific issues they are facing,"" the Fed said in a statement. 
The supervisory adjustments from the Fed mark the latest in an ongoing effort by U.S. bank regulators to assure banks in recent days that their overarching priority is ensuring firms continue to lend through the economic downturn, and not catching firms in foot-faults.
Earlier in March, European Union banking regulators delayed this year's stress test and eased some capital rules to avoid lenders turning off the taps over the coronavirus threat.

The Fed is currently scheduled to assess the capital plans for 34 large banks, with results published on June 30.

Investing.com - The Dow Jones Industrial Average set another record today, closing with its largest point gain ever and up 11.37%. That was the largest percentage gain since March 15, 1933.
On that day, the Dow jumped 15.34%, which was just 62.1 points, on the first trading day after FDR took office.
Wall Street’s initial rise came from positive comments about the stimulus bill on Capitol Hill to combat the effects of Covid-19.
President Donald Trump then took the ball. His comments through the day were tailor-made to take gains into record territory, especially his desire to open up the economy by Easter (controversial but market-friendly) and his commitment to save Dow component Boeing (NYSE:BA).
Now it’s back to Congress.
Here are three things the could move the markets tomorrow.
1. Stimulus Package Expected Soon
Leaders of both parties in Congress and the White House are currently working on specifics of the $2 trillion stimulus package that would provide direct cash to consumers and funding for business to name a couple of the provisions.
Republicans and Democrats were still hopeful of a vote Tuesday evening, but there were still details to be ironed out, The Washington Post reported.
Earlier, lawmakers said a deal was very close (first the five-yard line, then the two).
Passage in the evening could give global markets more time to parse the specifics, but as far as investors are concerned a stimulus package is coming.
But that leaves the implementation, the speed as which the money can get out and how the virus progresses.
2. Durable Goods on Tap
On the economic calendar tomorrow, the Commerce Department will report its latest numbers on orders for long-lasting goods, but, again, those numbers are from three weeks ago.
The numbers arrive at 8:30 AM ET (12:30 GMT).
February durable goods orders are expected to have fallen 0.8%, according to economists’ forecasts compiled by Investing.com.
Core durable goods orders, which exclude autos, are forecast to have fallen 0.4%.
3. Oil Inventories Seen Rising
Oil prices settled higher today and continued to show strength in late trading.
Tomorrow the oil inventories figures for the week ended March 20 arrive at 10:30 AM ET (14:30 GMT).
Analysts are looking for a stockpile build of about 2.8 million barrels, according to forecasts compiled by Investing.com.
Crude imports will also be of interest. They fell by more than 800,000 barrels the week before.
After the close of trading today, the American Petroleum Institute said its snapshot of oil inventories showed a decline of 1.25 million barrels. That gave prices a little kick higher after release."
628,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 24, 2020 05:30PM ET</span>","Ford joins GE, 3M in speeding up ventilator, respirator production","By Manas Mishra and Ben Klayman
(Reuters) - Carmaker  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) on Tuesday jumped into the emergency push by major U.S. manufacturers to produce thousands of ventilators and respirators needed to help combat the spread of the coronavirus under a partnership code-named ""Project Apollo.""
By joining forces with  General Electric 's (N:GE) healthcare unit and 3M Co (N:MMM), Ford is taking heed of U.S. President Donald Trump's call for U.S. automakers to work across sectors in producing equipment needed for the pandemic.
The rapid outbreak, which has killed more than 16,500 people globally, has strained healthcare systems around the world and led to a shortage of ventilators needed to treat patients suffering from the flu-like illness, which can lead to breathing difficulties and pneumonia in severe cases.
""We've been in regular dialogue with federal, state and local officials to understand the areas of greatest needs,"" Ford Chief Executive Jim Hackett said.
Ford said its partnerships were code-named ""Project Apollo"" after the Apollo 13 launch in 1970 when a lunar landing was aborted after an oxygen tank failed two days into the mission, forcing the astronauts to improvise a fix.
Ford and GE Healthcare will expand the production of GE's ventilator design to support patients with respiratory failure or difficulty breathing caused by the pathogen. In addition, they are developing a simplified design that Ford could begin making at one of its plants.
The plan is to get the new design approved quickly by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Tom Westrick, vice president and chief quality officer at GE Healthcare, said on a conference call. 
Ford also is evaluating a separate effort not involving GE with the British government to make additional ventilators.
Hackett told CNN he believes the industry can produce ""hundreds of thousands"" of ventilators by early to mid-May. ""There's no higher sense of urgency.""
Ford on Tuesday extended the shutdown of its North American plants beyond March 30 as originally planned, but a spokesman said the healthcare-related efforts are separate and continuing.
Separately, Ford will work with 3M to increase manufacturing capacity of its air-purifying respirators by up to a factor of 10 to meet a surge in demand for first responders and healthcare workers, while also similarly developing a simplified design that Ford could build at one of its Michigan plants.
Under the simplified design, Ford is looking at using fans from its Ford F-150 pickup's cooled seats to make parts of the respirators.
Additionally, Ford said its U.S. design team, working with the United Auto Workers union, was starting to test transparent full-face shields for first responders, which when paired with N95 respirator masks, could be an effective way of limiting exposure to the coronavirus. The company is targeting making more than 100,000 a week at non-vehicle manufacturing facilities in Michigan, including using 3D printers to help.
Ultimately, Ford officials want to create an open-sourced design that others can adopt and use to make their own shields.
""The teams are just getting scrappy. How do we use what we've got to get to something that's capable and would meet regulatory requirements,"" Jim Baumbick, the Ford vice president in charge of the automaker's efforts, told Reuters.
On Monday, No. 1 U.S. automaker General Motors Co (N:GM) said it was partnering with medical equipment maker Ventec to build ventilators at GM's parts plant in Indiana.

Meanwhile,  Fiat  Chrysler Automobile NV (MI:FCHA) (N:FCAU) told employees in an email that the Italian-American automaker would start converting one of its China plants to ultimately make over 1 million masks a month to help combat the coronavirus outbreak.

""We don't monetize many of the services where we're seeing increased engagement, and we've seen a weakening in our ads business in countries taking aggressive actions to reduce the spread of COVID-19,"" the company said in a statement.
Facebook shares fell about 1% after hours following an 8.7% rise in regular trade.
The company said messaging across its platforms had increased more than 50% over the last month in many of the worst affected countries. In Italy specifically, users have been spending 70% more time in its apps.
Group calling with three or more participants increased by over 1,000% in Italy in the last month.
Facebook declined a request for comment on precisely which of its markets were experiencing adverse business impact or the magnitude of that impact.
The company's statement echoes similar industry guidance the day before from  Twitter Inc  (O:TWTR), which reported a boost in active users but pulled its first-quarter revenue outlook and forecast an operating loss due to the outbreak.

Many advertisers have pulled marketing budgets to rein in costs because of virus-related uncertainty. Some are also apparently hesitant to advertise alongside coronavirus discussions for fear of associating their brands with the sensitive topic.

Nike (NYSE:NKE) shares gained 5.02% in postmarket trade following the report.
Nike announced earnings per share of $0.78 on revenue of $10.10 billion. Analysts polled by Investing.com anticipated EPS of $0.61 on revenue of $9.91 billion. That compared with EPS of $0.68 on revenue of $9.61 billion in the same period a year before. Nike had reported EPS of $0.70 on revenue of $10.33 billion in the previous quarter.
The beat on the top line was led growth in Nike Direct, its direct-to-consumer platform, and strong growth across EMEA, APLA and North America, though this was offset by the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on its business in Greater China, Nike said. Digital sales in Greater China increased more than 30% while brick-and-mortar retail sales were impacted by temporary store closures, it added.
""In the third quarter, on a currency-neutral basis, Greater China revenues were down 4 percent following 22 consecutive quarters of double-digit growth. However, during the first two months of the third quarter, Greater China’s revenue grew strong double digits, offset by the impacts of Covid-19 beginning in late January,"" Nike said.
Gross margin fell 80 basis points to 44.3%, driven by the impact from coronavirus spread, including a lower mix of sales in Greater China, its highest margin geography, as well as increased discounts to wholesale partners and higher costs related to a planned slowdown in factory output amid efforts to manage future inventory.
Analysts are expecting Nike to generate earnings per share of $0.53 and revenue of $10.04 billion in the upcoming quarter.
Nike shares are down 28% from the beginning of the year , still down 31.48% from its 52 week high of $105.62 set on January 22. They are under-performing the S&P 500 which is down 24.65% year to date.

Investing.com – The Dow racked up its biggest one-day point gain ever on Tuesday as investors bet that lawmakers on Capitol Hill will back a reported $2 trillion stimulus bill to combat economic fallout from the Covid-19 pandemic.
The Dow jumped 11.37%, or 2,1112.98 points. That was the biggest percentage gain for the blue-chip index since 1933.
TheS&P 500 gained 9.% and the Nasdaq Composite added 8.12%.
Following days of wrangling, U.S. lawmakers are reportedly closing in on a deal to roll out a coronavirus rescue package as soon as Wednesday that will deliver a much-needed fiscal boost to economy and efforts to stem the coronavirus outbreak, which has infected nearly 50,000 nationwide.
The bill could include measures to support the economy such as tax breaks, checks and bailouts for big businesses hurt by the outbreak. Measures to backstop payrolls have reportedly also been included the package as both sides of the political aisle continue negotiations.
Voting on the bill in the Senate reportedly is unlikely to take place on Tuesday night, but The White House is hopeful to have an agreement in principle by ""sunset,"" CNBC reported.
The update arrived as President Donald Trump said he would love to have the country open and ""raring to go"" as soon as Easter (April 12), despite several states currently in lockdown.
The powerful rally on Wall Street was lead by energy and industrials.
Energy stocks, which have been among the hardest-hit sectors, surged 16% underpinned by a jump in oil prices.
Industrials, meanwhile, were spearheaded by a surge in Boeing (NYSE:BA), up 20%, as investors bet the aircraft maker could be set for a big cash injection.
The aircraft maker was also boosted by comments from CEO David Calhoun who said he still expects the 737 MAX, which was grounded last year, to win FAA approval and return to service in early summer, CNBC reported.
In a Fox News interview, Trump said he would not allow Boeing to plunge into bankruptcy, insisting that the aircraft maker would need a ""a small amount"" of money, according to reports.
Tech, meanwhile, also caught a bid, with FANG and chip stocks in favor, as investors piled into to beaten-down names like Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC).
Needham analyst Rajvindra Gill upgraded Nvidia to buy from hold, citing the company's superior balance sheet and robust free cash flow, sending Nvidia up 17.5%."

Apple reopened its stores in China earlier this month.

635,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 24, 2020 03:36PM ET</span>",Some Mortgage Bond Investors See Opportunity in Market Sell-Off,"(Bloomberg) -- For certain agency mortgage investors the quote attributed to the 18th century banker Baron Rothschild to “buy when there’s blood in the streets” brings the current environment to mind.
With the Federal Reserve announcing unlimited purchases of agency MBS and Treasuries on Monday, Treasury yields are likely to move lower while mortgage spreads tighten. The move has already begun in mortgages. The Fannie Mae 30-year current coupon spread over a blend of 5- and 10-year Treasuries, a popular valuation model, had tightened to 1.39% at Monday’s close from a recent high of 1.80% on March 19. It was at 0.90% at the end of last year.
There may be more room to tighten if history is our guide. The current coupon spread fell to a historic low of 0.55% on Sept. 25, 2012, a few weeks after the central bank announced a QE3 of $40 billion per month of agency MBS purchases and extended its “low rate” promise into mid-2015.
For context, this week the Federal Reserve is targeting $50 billion of agency MBS purchases per day. Once the over-indebted market players such as mortgage REITs are done selling agency MBS to raise cash, the full weight of Fed buying is likely to be felt.
A primary concern coming into the year was that net supply was expected to increase by 26% over 2019. This issue can now be put to bed, as with just $265 billion expected this year, the Fed’s rampant buying will leave little if anything for private investors. In addition, where the private market was also expected to need to absorb about $20 billion in monthly roll-off from the Fed’s mortgage balance sheet, that too has been removed from the supply/demand equation.
Mortgage supply due to home sales and refinancings are likely to drop dramatically into the summer due to social distancing, as face-to-face meetings between homeowners and prospective buyers come to a halt. In a report from March 20, Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC). changed its supply forecast for the year to $2.6 trillion gross and $227 billion net, from $2.1 trillion and $283 billion, respectively, and noted that “technicals lean positive” for the sector.
Roll With It
All this Fed buying -- along with the Federal Housing Finance Agency authorizing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to enter into additional dollar roll transactions -- is a positive for the mortgage basis as they will boost dollar rolls. Dollar rolls will get additional support as prepayments are likely to drop over the near term, reducing that risk for the party that rolls in the collateral. In addition, slower prepayment speeds -- if TBA are trading at a premium -- boost those prices, and the entire conventional 30-year TBA coupon stack is trading well above par.
Dollar roll: A type of repurchase transaction in the mortgage pass-through securities market in which the buy-side counterparty of a “to-be-announced” (TBA) trade agrees to sell off the same TBA trade in the current month and to buy back the same trade in a future month
Another risk in dollar roll transactions is that of delivery, as the delivering side has an incentive to return to their counterparty what is termed the “worst-to-deliver” pools, those which exhibit the worst collateral characteristics, such as loan size, credit rating and servicer. Happily for mortgage investors, the central bank is notable for its habit of absorbing the worst-to-deliver pools, cleaning up the float for private investors. 
Some mortgage investors have taken note that we are back in the world of QE, and that despite the recent selloff and spread widening, agency MBS look enticing. “The Fed has shown that it will support the agency MBS market. So it depends what investors’ goals and risk tolerances are but for a safe, liquid asset that you are buying at almost record spreads along side the entity with the largest bazooka in the world, MBS make a lot of sense,” John Kerschner, head of securitized products at Janus Henderson Group Plc., told Bloomberg News on Monday.

SEATTLE (Reuters) -  Boeing Co 's (N:BA) chief financial officer said on Tuesday that the U.S. planemaker was not in discussions to raise new debt as the coronavirus pandemic batters global aviation.
""Not right now. The markets essentially are closed,"" Boeing CFO Greg Smith told Reuters by phone. ""I mean, there's really not much opportunity to raise any additional debt. That's one of the challenges.""
Boeing has sought $60 billion in U.S. government loans for itself and the aerospace industry. Congress could reach agreement on a stimulus and rescue package worth up to $2 trillion to respond to the massive economic damage from the coronavirus pandemic as soon as today.
Asked if Boeing could grant warrants or options under a bailout deal, Smith added that the broader U.S. aerospace supply chain needs access to credit.
""Having access to the credit markets is really important for us right now,"" he said.
He said the company was already seeing some recovery in China, hard hit initially by the fast-spreading coronavirus.
Smith also said a tie-up with Brazil planemaker Embraer (SA:EMBR3) remained strategically important to the company.

A slump in Embraer shares and cash concerns at Boeing driven by the impact of the coronavirus on air travel dealt a blow to the deal's fragile economics.

(Reuters) - Cannabis sales are touching new highs as customers across the United States and Canada stockpile weed to prepare for long spells of isolation because of the coronavirus pandemic.
Between March 16 and March 22, sales of recreational cannabis across key U.S. markets, including California, Colorado, Oregon and Alaska, were up 50% and medical marijuana sales rose 41% from the same period last year, figures obtained from cannabis point of sale and data platform Flowhub show.
Several U.S. states and Canadian provinces have taken steps to curb the fast-spreading coronavirus by issuing stay at home orders, restricting business operations, or closing down borders as death toll in both countries approaches 600.
While many businesses have been ordered shut, cannabis stores have been listed as essential services and allowed to remain open.
In Ontario, Canada's most populous province, online sales on the government-run Ontario Cannabis Store's (OCS) website have soared over the last two weeks, OCS director of communications Daffyd Roderick, said. For example, last weekend's orders were more than twice as high as only two weeks ago.
In Nova Scotia, which on Sunday became the latest province to declare coronavirus emergency, cannabis sales spiked 76% last week, according to the province's liquor commission, which controls sales of cannabis there.
Fears of months of supply disruptions were boosting Canadian sales, Stuart Titus, CEO of California-based Medical Marijuana Inc (PK:MJNA) told Reuters.
""We have seen stockpiling in Canada by consumers who have snapped up products from LPs (licensed producers).""
The surge in demand may offer pot producers a welcome respite after investors sold off cannabis stocks throughout much of last year as profits in the sector remained elusive.
Jamie Pearson, CEO of California-based Bhang Inc , which makes cannabis-infused beverages, chocolates and other products, said sales were booming and should boost revenue and profits this quarter.
Pearson said edibles such as gummies, brownies, and chocolates, were most popular, probably because they were easier to store and eat, even with gloves on.
Still, Titus and others recommended caution, saying the long-awaited reversal of fortune could prove not much more than a short-lived relief.
""The cannabis industry is showing itself to be recession-proof but at times like this, it's important to understand that the spike in consumer demand is probably not going to last long,"" Avis Bulbulyan, CEO of cannabis consulting firm Siva Enterprises, said.

Cash jumped by by almost 19 billion euros ($20 billion), according to European Central Bank data. The ECB’s total balance sheet expanded by 223 billion euros as massive liquidity injections added to assets.
With consumers in the euro-area ramping up spending as they try to stockpile goods ahead of coronavirus shutdowns, demand for notes and coins has spiked.
The last time the jump was this large, the generally accepted reason was cash hoarding amid fears of imminent bank failures.
“The strong increase in weekly demand seen last week is to a large extent likely to be explained by people spending more in supermarkets and shops due to uncertainty related to the coronavirus pandemic,” an ECB spokesperson said. “The demand for banknotes in that week was similar to the demand in the week for Christmas.”
Under its rules, the ECB must meet all cash requirements from banks, so the institution has no direct control over the amount of physical currency in the region.

That was the last time the world witnessed a sustained downturn in both emerging markets and their developed-nation counterparts, she said. As a result, it would be difficult to bet on a short-term rebound in assets, like when riskier securities snapped back after the 2008 global financial crisis or when developed markets performed relatively well during the Latin American debt crises of the 1980s, she said.
“Today is reminiscent of the 1930s,” Reinhart said in an interview on Tuesday from her home in St. Petersburg, Florida, where she relocated after Harvard pivoted to online learning. “The slump in commodities, the crash in global trade and synchronization of recessions is more like then than any time.”
The Cuba-born economist said she expects China’s growth rate to turn negative, meaning the world’s second-largest economy will be less willing to lend to nations in Latin America, Africa and Asia. Emerging markets already appeared weaker as a whole than the global financial crisis based on their reserves, growth rates and commodity prices.
She said the double whammy of the coronavirus and the Saudi-Russia oil price war is the “kiss of death” for producers like Ecuador, Angola and Algeria. It will also inevitably delay debt restructuring processes from Argentina to Lebanon and lead corporate defaults to “skyrocket,” according to Reinhart.
Pandemic Threatens to Disrupt $160 Billion of Debt Negotiations
On Monday evening, Ecuador’s Finance Minister Richard Martinez said the government would pay bonds maturing today while putting close to $200 million of interest payments on hold, using grace periods to spend the money instead in response to the coronavirus.
“Ecuador will be defaulting,” Reinhart said. “The finance minister’s words are extremely reasonable, but you’re basically hoping oil prices will be higher and the coronavirus will be waning.”

Intel's decision follows measures by big companies including AT&T Inc and Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co, which last week announced similar plans, citing coronavirus concerns.

645,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 24, 2020 01:47PM ET</span>",Stocks - Dow Rides Energy Higher as Oil Climbs; All Eyes on Capitol Hill,"By Yasin Ebrahim 
Investing.com – The Dow on Tuesday clawed back its losses from a day earlier amid reports that U.S. lawmakers are inching closer to approving a reported $2 trillion coronavirus package to support the economy and efforts nationwide to combat the Covid-19 pandemic.
The Dow jumped 8.51%, theS&P 500 gained 7.36% and the Nasdaq Composite added 6.13%.
With fears over a recession intensifying, investors are closely watching the progress on Capitol Hill as U.S. lawmakers are expected to vote later today on the coronavirus rescue package, which includes measures to support the economy such as tax breaks, checks and bailouts for big businesses hurt by the outbreak. Measures to backstop payrolls have reportedly also been included the package as both sides of the political aisle continue negotiations. 
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer reportedly said stimulus talks are ""on the two yard line,"" and added that the bill will pay full salary for four months for workers out of a job due to nationwide containment measures to stem the virus spread.
Covid-19 infections in the U.S. rose to 46,805 from 33,453 a day earlier.
Energy stocks, which have been among the hardest-hit sectors, led the broader rally on Wall Street amid an uptick in oil prices.
Industrials, meanwhile, also contributed to the rally, spearheaded by a surge in Boeing (NYSE:BA), up 15% as investors bet the aircraft maker could be set for a big cash injection.
The aircraft maker was also boosted by comments from CEO David Calhoun who said he still expects the 737 MAX, which was grounded last year, to win FAA approval and return to service in early summer, CNBC reported.
Tech, meanwhile, also caught a bid, with FANG and chip stocks in favor as investors pile into to beaten-down names like Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) rising sharply."
646,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 24, 2020 01:36PM ET</span>",Gold Market Snarled by Virus Lockdown as World Races for Haven,"(Bloomberg) -- The gold market is creaking, in the latest sign of how the coronavirus pandemic is causing chaos across financial markets.
Just as demand for the metal soars with investors seeking a safe haven from unprecedented economic turmoil, a glitch has appeared in the global market. The price of gold in New York and London has diverged by the most in four decades after lockdowns and grounded planes strangled the supply routes that allow physical gold to move around the globe.
The strains have rippled through gold trading, with liquidity at some points running thin in a vast market that’s dominated by the world’s biggest banks and watched by millions of mom-and-pop investors. 
Banks and traders typically ship gold around the world on commercial flights, linking the trading hubs of London and New York with vaults and refineries in Switzerland, Hong Kong and Singapore. But as the coronavirus grounds flights and refineries shut down, it’s becoming harder to trade between global markets. Silver and other precious metal markets are also being disrupted by the logistics lockdown.
“This isn’t anything that we’ve seen in a generation because refiners never had to shutdown – not in war, not in the great financial crisis, not in natural disasters,” Tai Wong, the head of metals derivatives trading at BMO Capital Markets, said by phone. “It’s never happened. And it happened astonishingly rapidly.”
At issue is whether there will be enough gold in New York to deliver against futures contracts traded on the Comex, which is owned by CME Group Inc. (NASDAQ:CME) While the larger spot market in London is dominated by 400-ounce bars of gold, only 100-ounce and kilobars are deliverable on the Comex contract. CME has taken some steps to try to address the squeeze.
Record Highs
Gold futures on the Comex in New York shot to the highest premium to the London spot price in four decades on Tuesday. By midday on Wednesday, the difference had dropped to around $15 an ounce. The skyrocketing spread between New York and London gold price underscores how desperate investors are to find a safe haven amid the market tumult brought on by the virus.
The last time the New York-London spread was this massive was in 1980 -- when the precious metals markets had been roiled by an oil shock and the Iranian revolution, as well as the Hunt brothers’ attempted corner of the silver market.
Late on Tuesday, CME Group said it would rush the launch of a new gold futures contract under which 400-ounce bars would also be deliverable. The move offers a way to address the squeeze, if holders of Comex futures are willing to exchange for the new contract.
“This new contract will provide customers with maximum flexibility in managing physical delivery,” said Derek Sammann, senior managing director and global head of commodity and options products at CME, citing “unprecedented market conditions.”
As of Tuesday, open interest in the April gold contract stood at 152,603 contracts, equivalent to 15.3 million ounces, but total deliverable stocks in Comex warehouses were just over half that.
Gold futures for June delivery climbed as much as 7.7% in New York on Tuesday and at their peak had a $67.57 an ounce premium over spot prices in London. Based on closing prices going back to the mid-1970s, the biggest spread between a most-active contract and spot gold was $67 in 1980, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
On Wednesday, most-active futures for June delivery were down 2.3% at $1,624.60 an ounce at midday in London.
However, the pressure on the April contract continued, with April trading at a $3.70 premium to June -- an indication of the level of the squeeze. On Tuesday, the April-June spread traded as high as $20 an ounce.
Ordinarily, banks and traders would ship supplies from refineries in Switzerland or Asia, which manufacture 100-ounce and kilobars for their investor clients, to New York in response to such a large Comex premium. But because of the outbreak, some have been reluctant to take advantage of the arbitrage out of fear that flights and truck deliveries will be canceled and trap their supplies, according to one senior trader, who asked not to be identified because the information isn’t public.
Peter Thomas, a senior vice president at Chicago-based broker Zaner Group, said that a similar dynamic was playing out in other precious metals markets such as silver.
“This hasn’t happened before, and this is very unique: We have a situation where there is silver available but no one will deliver it,” he said. “They won’t load the trucks. They won’t load the planes because the coronavirus. Even though there is product around they won’t pick it up.”

651,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 24, 2020 01:25PM ET</span>",Italy calls for unconditional use of euro bailout fund to ease virus hit,"By Giuseppe Fonte
ROME (Reuters) - Italian Economy Minister Roberto Gualtieri said on Tuesday that the euro zone's bailout fund, the European Stability Mechanism, should be used to help economies hit by the coronavirus crisis, with no strings attached.
Some richer northern euro zone nations have expressed unease about making the fund available without policy conditions aimed at making its recipients more economically competitive.
""We must use all the resources available at the EU level, including the ESM, without any conditionality,"" Gualtieri told parliament.
Gualtieri's position is also different to that of some members of the ruling coalition in Rome, who do not want Italy to use the ESM at all, arguing it would saddle the country with long term debt that would be hard to repay.
Euro zone finance ministers are due on Tuesday to discuss proposals by the European Commission to deploy the fund, which has 410 billion euros ($444 billion) of unused lending power, as a coronavirus cushion.
Italy has borne the brunt of the outbreak in Europe, and earlier on Tuesday Antonio Misiani, Gualtieri's deputy minister, told Reuters the only acceptable conditionality should be that the ESM cash is used ""to manage the health and economic emergency"".
Misiani, like Gualtieri, is from the center-left Democratic Party, but its coalition partner, the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement, is reluctant to deploy the ESM, fearing it would place tougher fiscal obligations on Rome and impinge on national sovereignty.
""The ESM doesn't work. Using this instrument to take on a debt for decades is absolutely not in our interests,"" Raphael Raduzzi, a 5-Star member of the parliamentary finance committee, told Reuters.
ECB ROLE
In a bid to stop a pandemic-induced financial rout from shredding the euro zone's economy, the European Central Bank last week launched a 750-billion-euro emergency bond purchase program and said it was ready to do more if necessary.
The ESM could unlock unlimited ECB sovereign bond purchases through the ECB's Outright Monetary Transactions program (OMT).
To provide the credit, the ESM would have to borrow on the market via what officials say would be called ""coronabonds"", to make clear money from the operation would go only towards fighting the effects of the epidemic.
Currently, the ESM can help euro zone countries only on condition they adjust their economic policies to overcome the problems that led them to seek financial assistance.
Both Germany and the Netherlands have said they do not favor ESM loans without such conditions.
More people have died of COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus, in Italy than in any other country. The toll rose by 602 on Monday to 6,077.
Italy's Treasury has estimated its economy will contract by around 3% this year due to the lockdown imposed to fight the outbreak, sources said last week, while stressing that the situation was highly uncertain and subject to downside risks.
Gualtieri said in his testimony to parliament on Tuesday that he expected a steep fall in gross domestic product in the first half of the year, and a full year contraction of ""a few percentage points"". He did not provide figures.

652,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 24, 2020 12:56PM ET</span>",Coronavirus redraws battle lines on airline emissions,"By Laurence Frost and Kate Abnett
PARIS/BRUSSELS (Reuters) - European airlines crippled by the coronavirus have demanded lasting relief from environmental taxes - in a move that pits their immediate survival against longer-term emissions goals.
The looming tax tussle underscores shifting environmental battle lines and a broader question for governments injecting billions into their afflicted economies: Should bailouts come before climate objectives or rather be used to advance them? 
The airline sector has been fighting a losing battle against tax in Europe. Governments have imposed new levies to slow growth in traffic and emissions, while the European Union plans to begin taxing jet fuel. 
""This industry is going to have more taxes, not less taxes, and I think you all know it,"" top EU transport official Henrik Hololei told airline CEOs in Brussels this month.
""So you can indulge yourselves with a study of what it would be like if there were no taxes - but the reality is unfortunately much harsher."" That reality is being put to the test.
Within days of the meeting, the pandemic had dramatically worsened, forcing airlines to suspend most flights, lay off thousands of staff and seek government aid to avert collapse. Besides public cash, airlines are pushing to defer or waive of a swath of European taxes and duties. 
""After the crisis we hope governments will understand that the fragility of this industry is due to low margins and heavy cost of capital,"" the head of the International Air Transport Association (IATA) said. 
""And that it is not economically and financially wise to increase taxation on a sector that is structurally fragile and financially weak,"" Alexandre de Juniac told reporters.
BAILOUT CONDITIONS 
With airlines at the front of bailout queues, green advocates fear climate action may lose momentum, just as it did after the 2008 financial crisis. Collapsed oil prices also work against pricier aviation biofuels. 
Some are calling for aid to depend on emissions cuts. 
""Public money should support the technologies of the future and not reinforce the mistakes of the past,"" said Andrew Murphy of Transport & Environment. The campaign group wants airlines to be forced to use more low-carbon fuel and pay tax on kerosene and international ticket sales, in return for bailouts.
""Airlines calling for public support in bad times should accept they need to start paying taxes in good times,"" he said. 
U.S. Democratic lawmakers have also proposed requiring airlines to cut emissions by 25% within 15 years and 50% by 2050 in return for $40 billion in grants. 
In Australia, any Qantas (AX:QAN) rescue would likely require faster progress on carbon, sources with knowledge of the matter told Reuters.
The coronavirus shutdown is likely to result in a full-year decline in emissions from aviation and other industries. Some experts say that could dilute public support for climate action.
CO2 BLIP
IATA said on Tuesday it now expects 2020 air traffic to fall by 38% before embarking on a recovery later this year. That could cut carbon dioxide emissions by several hundred million tonnes, based on earlier forecasts and data. 
Any ""short-term blip"" in emissions should not prevent governments from using coronavirus stimulus to achieve longer-term reductions, Fatih Birol, head of the International Energy Agency, said in a recent commentary.
""Rather than compounding the tragedy by allowing it to hinder clean energy transitions, we need to seize the opportunity to help accelerate them,"" Birol wrote. 
Aviation emissions account for 2.5% of the global total but are expected to triple by 2050. Under a U.N.-backed scheme, the industry plans to use carbon offsets to counter their growth beyond 2020. 
Airlines caught in the crisis remain determined to get a long break from taxes including the proposed European fuel duty. The region's carriers pay 6 billion euros ($6.4 billion) in annual tax, according to lobby group Airlines for Europe. 
""We in Europe are worse hit than airlines in some other regions,"" said a government relations executive at a major European carrier, who declined to be identified. 
The airline is pressing its government for a moratorium on new taxation, ""in particular the tax being discussed within the European Green Deal"", the executive said. ""It could seriously weaken European airlines against the global competition."" 
The fate of European attempts to rein in airline emissions is among many such trade-offs yet to play out across economies ravaged by the coronavirus pandemic. 
Policymakers need to ""sit back, make the right choices and not lock in the fossil-fuel economy,"" said Laurence Tubiana, who helped broker the 2015 Paris Agreement as France's climate ambassador. ""It's a make-or-break moment.""

653,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 24, 2020 12:55PM ET</span>",Philips warns protectionism could derail critical medical supplies,"By Bart H. Meijer
AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Broad powers over U.S. factories brought in by President Donald Trump could fuel protectionism and jeopardize the supply of critical medical equipment to fight the coronavirus pandemic, Dutch health technology company Philips warned on Tuesday.
Trump said on Friday he had put into action the U.S. Defense Production Act, a law dating back to the Korean War of the 1950s that grants him sweeping authority to expedite and expand the supply of resources from U.S. factories.
That could include hospital ventilators which Philips makes in factories in California and Pennsylvania. 
""We are worried"", Philips (AS:PHG) spokesman Steve Klink told Reuters on Tuesday, referring to the act. 
Amsterdam-based Philips said on Sunday it would increase production of critical medical supplies for the diagnosis and care of patients with the new coronavirus disease COVID-19. 
Most importantly, it said it would double its production of hospital ventilators in the coming weeks to help meet soaring global demand, and was aiming at a four-fold increase by the third quarter.
All these ventilators, however, are produced in its two U.S. factories, which makes Philips' promise to ship them to the regions where they are most needed vulnerable to interventions by the U.S. government.
Such interventions could not only limit supply outside the United States, Klink said, but could also leave the country itself with less equipment than it would otherwise have - if retaliation in Europe or Asia squeezed the supply of critical parts. 
""We know we can meet our production promises"", Klink said. 
""But only if the entire supply chain cooperates. A respiratory device has many parts, which come from all over the world. Protectionism can have a detrimental effect, no matter if it happens at the end of the production line or somewhere in between.""
In a tweet posted on Tuesday, Trump said the Defense Production Act was in full force, but had not been used yet.
A few hours later, CNN reported the Trump administration was planning to procure 60,000 coronavirus test kits through the first use of the act.
The Dutch ministry of foreign affairs said it was in talks with both Philips and the Trump administration on the matter, but declined further comment. 
Philips said it was optimistic its exports of ventilators would be unaffected, as Chief Executive Frans van Houten continued to be in talks with the U.S. government. 

""As long as we are in talks, we remain confident in a positive outcome.""

655,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 24, 2020 12:36PM ET</span>",All the Signs the Huge Liquidation Stress in Markets Is Easing,"(Bloomberg) -- There are signs that a global liquidation rout for the history books is loosening its stranglehold across stocks, credit and funding markets.
U.S. equities surged Tuesday, implied volatility dropped for a fourth day and investment-grade credit premiums fell in the aftermath of the Federal Reserve’s historic new stimulus program.
Policy firepower to forestall the economic fallout from the spreading coronavirus is lifting dollar liquidity and cross-asset price swings are easing. All that is helping market players look past the recent frenzy of panic selling.
“These more wide-ranging measures look much more likely to allow the free-fall in risk assets to at least stabilize,” said Mizuho strategists led by Peter Chatwell.
So while evidence of a brewing recession piles up, virus cases across the world surge and a fiscal stimulus plan fights its way through Congress, reasons for cautious optimism exist. From quant investing to the volatility market, there are signs that a calmer and more orderly state of trading is around the corner to absorb any fresh wave of selling.
Here’s some evidence on that front, with judicious caveats.
Vol Crunch
Price swings in recent sessions have been easing in the midst of the stock bear market, an unusual development. The Cboe Volatility Index, or VIX, is dropping for the fourth day in a row, a streak that includes two days when U.S. stocks slumped.
While that isn’t evidence of a market bottom, it could hint that the worst of the selling is over, according to Michael Purves of Tallbacken Capital Advisors LLC. Add realized volatility slipping from historic highs, and it’s looking less fearful out there.
“We can see the moves are fading from the ‘limit down’ days of last week,” wrote Purves.
Systematic Selling
With many systematic players taking their cues to sell from high implied or realized volatility, this may mean peak quant selling is behind us.
Systematic clients on  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Group AG’s prime-brokerage platform have seen their equity exposure drop by 45% this month compared with the end of last.
As cross-asset correlations normalize -- stocks were up and bonds down on Tuesday -- and price swings calm, strategies that are sensitive to volatility, such as risk parity, will not have to deleverage as quickly.
Fed Buying
Stock investors taking their cues on the health of Corporate America from credit traders may also rest a little easier given the Fed’s resolve to boost company balance sheets.
As part of its stimulus package, the Fed said it will purchase up to 10% of an issuer’s outstanding bonds and up to 20% of the assets of any ETF that primarily holds investment-grade debt.
Right on cue, the $30 billion iShares iBoxx Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF, ticker LQD, surged by 7.4% on the news -- the most since 2008. The fund had been hammered in part because some investors likely ditched their most liquid assets to shift into cash.
The gains for the ETF also helped to close a yawning gap between the price of the fund and its underlying assets that had sparked consternation among traders. The fear was that rampant redemptions by passive investors could have exacerbated the sell-off in the underlying bonds in recent weeks.
The Fed may have acted as a circuit-breaker in that regard. “Expanding buying into ETFs will help stem the doom-loop caused by passive-money selling, and is a promising step,” Mizuho’s Chatwell wrote.
Anecdotally, liquidity in certain credit products may also be rising after a collapse that helped intensify the March turmoil. Purves at Tallbacken notes that options on BlackRock’s iShares iBoxx High Yield Corporate Bond ETF “were $2 wide a couple of weeks ago; today many strikes are down to $0.25 or $.30 bid/offers.” That’s “not great, but better” than the dire trading conditions seen in recent weeks, he wrote.
Metals Rally
There’s a counterintuitive reason for cheer that’s a sign of these disruptive times: Gold and silver, traditional havens, have been rallying.
That’s likely an indication that forced liquidations have subsided. The yellow metal had been declining over the past two weeks despite the wider market turmoil, because investors were favoring the dollar and sold gold to raise cash.
Basis Blues
A combination of margin calls, liquidations and companies and investors opting to hoard cash has soaked up dollar liquidity -- sparking a tightening of international financial conditions at a pace rarely seen before.
The Fed’s bazooka, including beefed-up emergency swap lines, has eased short-end funding stresses as seen by the tentative normalization in the market for cross-currency basis swaps.
A gauge of the dollar’s strength against major currencies is now on course for its first decline in 11 days, suggesting an improved risk climate.
For liquidity conditions to normalize from here, a steeper yield curve, higher market-derived inflation expectations and real rates at minus 2% are all needed, according to Jefferies LLC strategists led by Sean Darby. On that basis, American policy makers have more stimulus work to do, they wrote in a note.
For now, market participants are continuing to adjust to a new world of oncoming defaults and a sudden stop in consumer demand and investment, and that’s creating all manner of crisis-era bumps. The so-called Ted spread surged to scary levels Tuesday -- a sign of rising counterparty risk in one corner of the funding market.
But at least the pace of selling appears to be easing.

656,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 24, 2020 12:35PM ET</span>",Fear gauges throttle back after rollercoaster run,"By Saikat Chatterjee and Thyagaraju Adinarayan
LONDON (Reuters) - Stock and currency fear gauges that soared to the levels of the 2008 global financial crisis have become less frantic since central banks and governments stepped up efforts to combat spreading economic damage from the coronavirus epidemic.
But while that decline in market volatility will offer some respite to battered investors, it is too soon to declare that markets have bottomed out after a 30% cliff-edge drop from record highs.
The Cboe Volatility Index (VIX), known as Wall Street's fear gauge, is at 52 points, well below its March 16 record closing high of 82.7.
""To get investors back into the market I really would like to see the VIX not making new highs,"" said Andrew Sheets, head of cross-asset strategy at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) in London.
""That would be a positive sign and consistent with the market bottoms we saw in 2009, 2016 etc.""
The stock market selloff led investors to draw comparisons with the 2008 crisis, when markets bottomed six months after the VIX blow out. 
(Graphic: VIX top, market bottom 2008 vs 2020, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/buzzifr/15/9979/9979/Pasted%20Image.jpg)
Currency volatility has also throttled back, though it remains relatively high.
A  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) index for currency volatility <.DBCVIX> in recent days jumped to its highest in its eight-year old history, pressuring hedge funds and risk parity funds to unwind leveraged positions in a selloff characterized as a value-at-risk shock.
The Deutsche indicator has retreated over the last two sessions but remains as 14%, twice its life-time average. 
Prior to the coronavirus-induced reversal, bets against volatility enjoyed a long run of popularity that continued up to January and with net short positions on VIX futures contracts <11170E1NNET> hitting a record at end-2019 as investors remained convinced that policymakers would keep market fluctuations in check.
Now, massive stimulus from central banks and governments - including Monday's announcement by the Fed that it would buy unlimited bonds and backstop direct loans to companies - ""has stabilized market volatility to some extent,"" said Vasileios Gkionakis, head of FX strategy at Lombard Odier.
Traders typically set limits against potential losses in their operations by calculating VaR - a statistical measure used to quantify an expected loss over a specified horizon at a certain confidence level in normal markets.
VaR can tell a bank's management how big the following day's maximum loss for a trading floor might be. Based on previous market volatility and return metrics, a lower VAR reading would encourage traders to raise the size of their trading positions in a low volatility environment, and vice versa.
When volatility jumps as happened when the coronavirus started spreading across the globe, these investors exceed their limits, forcing them to cut positions rapidly in a falling market. JP Morgan calculated that last week's VaR shock was the biggest since Lehman collapsed in September 2008.
The VIX equity gauge typically jumps at times of panic among investors, and markets remain worried that lockdowns caused by the virus could trigger the deepest recession in decades.
""We are moving 4% a day and that kind of high vol is unhealthy. I think that vol needs to stabilize before the broader market can heal,"" Morgan Stanley's Sheets added.

The No.1 U.S. automaker, which also suspended its 2020 outlook, said it was evaluating its quarterly dividend, but has not yet decided to suspend it. As of the end of 2019, GM had $34.6 billion in liquidity, including $17.3 billion in cash.
Companies across the globe are tapping their credit lines to shore up liquidity and help them cover their costs amidst a crisis which has brought many elements of the global economy to a complete standstill.
""We are aggressively pursuing austerity measures to preserve cash and are taking necessary steps in this changing and uncertain environment to manage our liquidity,"" Chief Executive Officer Mary Barra said.
The pandemic has already hit other automakers as well and more are expected to cut their expectations. 
Last week, rival Ford abandoned its 2020 forecast and said it drew down $15.4 billion from two credit facilities to bolster its balance sheet. Its more than $37 billion in cash now dwarfs its market capitalization of about $16 billion.
Analysts believe that corporate liquidity is paramount and the U.S. automakers have strong enough balance sheets to weather the outbreak's impact.
Both GM and Ford have seen U.S. employees test positive for the virus, leading them to shutdown their North American plants to prevent its spread among factory workers.
Meanwhile. U.S. new vehicle demand dropped 13% in the first 19 days of March, according to research firm J.D. Power, while brokerage  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) expects auto sales to decline 9% this year, a first in many years.

Shares of both Ford and GM were up 7.5% to 11% in premarket trading.

658,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 24, 2020 12:26PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Citadel turns 2020 profit after spotting virus risk early,"By Lawrence Delevingne
BOSTON (Reuters) - Citadel, the Chicago-based hedge fund giant led by billionaire Ken Griffin, has so far weathered the coronavirus market storm well, turning a slight profit in its flagship Wellington hedge fund for the year through Monday, according to a person familiar with the situation. 
The fund, which practices a so-called multi-strategy array of bets on stocks, bonds, commodities and other securities using teams of traders, was as of Friday down 5.25% for March, the person said, who requested anonymity because the information is private. The exact year-to-date gain, which is net of fees, was not finalized. 
By comparison, Goldman Sachs’ prime services division estimated that the average equity-focused hedge fund is down 15.5% for the month through Thursday, with average year-to-date losses at nearly 16%. 
Citadel's multi-strategy competitors are still down for the year amid the coronavirus-led market rout. Millennium Management LLC’s main hedge fund is down about 4.3% for 2020 through March 20, while Schonfeld Strategic Advisors LLC is down about 15% through March 16, according to people briefed on the returns. 
The exact drivers of Citadel’s relative outperformance were unclear. The Wall Street Journal previously reported that Citadel’s fixed-income portfolio recently lost hundreds of millions of dollars, in part from so-called basis trades on pricing gaps between U.S. Treasuries and futures, although those unrealized losses were recovered within days. The Citadel Global Fixed Income Fund is now positive for the year through Monday, the person with knowledge of Citadel said. 
SPOTTING RISK
Citadel showed it was thinking about coronavirus and its market impact relatively early. 
On Feb. 6, Griffin called the coronavirus “probably the most concrete short-run risk we see in the financial markets globally” during an appearance at The Economic Club of New York.
""It’s not a Chinese health crisis. It is a global health crisis,"" he said.
Citadel had three days earlier announced that its executives had mobilized $7.5 million to support relief efforts in the United States and China, including more than $1 million in medical supplies to a hospital in hard-hit Wuhan. 
The firm recently set up the Citadel Relative Value Fixed Income Fund, according to a March 13 filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), a bid to take advantage of new market volatility.
Citadel has placed an emphasis on risk management since the last financial crisis, when its main funds lost 55% over 2008 and were forced to temporarily limit client withdrawals. 
Its website touts “a quarter of a century establishing risk management as a core discipline” and a global risk management center in Chicago, anchored by a 27 foot by 8 foot data visualization touchscreen.
The firm still uses significant leverage, or borrowed money, to amplify its potential profits. A Jan. 17 SEC filing notes regulatory assets under management of about $194 billion as of Dec. 31, 2018, implying leverage of approximately six and a half times Citadel's $30 billion in invested assets as of February, according to its website. 

2020 marks 30 years since Citadel was founded by Griffin, who famously started the firm after trading from his Harvard College dorm room. The annualized return for Citadel's Wellington fund, launched in 1990, was 18.78% net of fees through 2019, the person said, more than double the S&P 500 Index.

The company said on Tuesday it would suspend production beginning March 25 until April 8, including at its main Wichita, Kansas facility, a day after Boeing (N:BA) halted production at its Washington state twin-aisle jetliner factory.
The deadly coronavirus outbreak has spread to almost all countries of the world, prompting large-scale lockdowns and virtually wiping out air travel demand.
Boeing's airline customers have deferred taking new aircraft and making pre-delivery downpayments, compounding its troubles related to the grounding of its once fast-selling 737 MAX jet after fatal crashes. Boeing halted 737 production in January.
Spirit said it would continue to pay employees who are sent home during the two-week period due to the suspension of Boeing work.

Spirit will, however, continue to support 787 work for Boeing's Charleston, South Carolina, facility.

Ventilators, which are used to blow air and oxygen into the lungs, are critical for treating people with lung failure, which can afflict patients with severe COVID-19, the disease coronavirus causes.
""We've set up an additional assembly line,"" Air Liquide said in an emailed statement to Reuters, adding that workers were completely mobilized to produce the equipment. 
The Air Liquide Medical Systems production site at Antony, just outside Paris, currently makes 500 ventilators that are used for resuscitation, and aims to ramp up monthly output to 1,100 in April, the company said. 
Another site in Pau produces non-invasive ventilators, and plans to produce 600 units in April, compared with the present level of 200.
The group said it was also talking to the French government to see how other industrial companies might more broadly contribute to making breathing support equipment. 
Shortages of ventilators across Europe are pushing states, including in Italy, to enlist help from the military and other manufacturers and even look at 3D printing to ramp up production.

The decision by the Seattle-based Amazon's India unit follows a similar move to stop shipping non-essential products to consumers in Italy and France, countries hit hard by the virus outbreak.
Amazon India will prioritize the sale and delivery of household staples, packaged foods, healthcare, hygiene and personal safety products, the company said in a blog post.
The company said it was seeing a surge in demand for essential good and services, adding that it was giving customers the option to cancel undelivered orders for lower-priority products and get refunds.
Amazon did not give a timeline for the resumption of normal operations.
India's lockdown of several cities has disrupted deliveries by e-commerce firms and online grocers.
Walmart Inc's (N:WMT) Flipkart, Amazon's main rival in India, said it was extending delivery timelines in the light of disruptions in several states.
To enable millions of Indians working from home to access household supplies, the federal technology ministry on Tuesday advised state governments to allow e-commerce services to operate, especially with respect to essential items.

Investing.com -- U.S. stocks continued to rally Tuesday morning, as markets took heart from reports that the U.S. Congress will agree a ‘phase 3’ package of measures to support the economy through the Covid-19 pandemic.
By 10:57 AM ET (15:57 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 1,352 points or 7.3%. The S&P 500 was up 6.4% and the Nasdaq Composite was up 5.5%. The Nasdaq has performed the best of the three major indices since the Covid-19 outbreak exploded outside of China, losing only 19% in the last month.
On Capitol Hill, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told reporters that there is ""real optimism"" that an agreement can be reached within the next few hours. And Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said a stimulus package deal was ""on the five yard line,"" very close to going through.
President Donald Trump had earlier again tweeted his impatience, saying that the passage of the next support bill was essential to get the U.S. back to work.
""Congress must approve the deal, without all of the nonsense, today. The longer it takes, the harder it will be to start up our economy. Our workers will be hurt!"" Trump said. The package has been stalled for two days amid Democratic resistance to its provisions for bailouts of large businesses on what they say are too easy terms, with not enough transparency. 
Reassurance on the next round of fiscal stimulus is also allowing markets to focus on the far-ranging implications of the measures announced on Monday by the Federal Reserve. The Fed has now offered an almost unconditional backstop to most classes of debt in the U.S. capital markets, having unveiled facilities to support commercial mortgages and corporate bonds, municipal bonds and money-market funds and small-business lending, in addition to its expanded purchases of government and agency debt.
The scale of the impact on the economy from Covid-19 is quickly becoming apparent. The composite purchasing managers index for the U.S. published by IHS Markit fell to its lowest ever level in March at 40.5, a level that indicates sharp contraction. Markit's PMI for the euro zone, published earlier, had also fallen to its lowest ever - a more significant milestone because the latter data series goes back to the last financial crisis (which the U.S. series doesn't).
Premarket releases were again dominated by announcements of companies suspending their outlooks for the year due to the uncertainty, and taking urgent measures to conserve cash.  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) stock rose 15.5% after it indicated it won't cut its dividend, although it suspended share buybacks and said it will cut capital spending by 20% this year.
Refiner Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX) stock rose 4% after similarly slashing spending by 18% but upholding its dividend plans
Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) stock also rose 6.4% after it suspended its buyback program. The chipmaker forecast a ""material"" impact on sales this year but said its production facilities would stay open, in contrast to many factories with large workforces that have had to close due to public health measures.

""The securities industry had a good year in 2019, but the serious damage that COVID-19 is inflicting on financial markets and the global economy will sharply reduce industry profits this year,"" New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli said in a statement, referring to the disease caused by the coronavirus.
Pretax profits for the securities divisions of New York Stock Exchange member firms rose 2.8% to $28.1 billion in 2019, the fourth year of consecutive growth for NYSE broker dealers.
Although only about 182,000 people work on Wall Street, its well-paid traders and sales people earn about one-fifth of all private-sector wages in New York City, according to the report. 
The securities industry overall paid $13.2 billion, or roughly 17%, of state tax collections during the 2019 state fiscal year, and $3.7 billion, or 6%, of city tax collections over the same period, according to the report.
DiNapoli warned that the city and state will likely need to fill gaps in their tax base as the cost of the coronavirus to the securities industry will result in lower taxes paid for 2020. 
""The securities industry is integral to New York state's and New York City's economies, as a source of tax revenue and job creator in other industries,"" DiNapoli said. ""The state and the city need to prepare for the severe budgetary implications of the coronavirus crisis.""

LONDON (Reuters) - A string of investment-grade companies rushed to take advantage of improved debt market sentiment to raise much-needed cash on Tuesday -- and were met with overwhelming investor demand.
In a sign that Monday's unprecedented stimulus package from the U.S. Federal Reserve had cleared at least some of the funding logjam, Sanofi (PA:SASY), Nestle,  Diageo  (LON:DGE), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Coca Cola European Partners and France's BPCE all launched bonds.
All are rated single-A or higher.
French biopharmaceutical firm Sanofi generated nearly 10 billion euros of orders by mid-morning for a sale of five-year and 10-year bonds with a target size of 1.5 billion euros, said a lead manager.
Nestle's six-year and 10-year issue drew even more interest, with nearly 13 billion euros of orders allowing the Swiss firm to double its target size to 2 billion euros.
""The Fed bazooka is a big game-changer, it helps very strong issuers come back to the market and reopen it,"" said Jerome Legras, head of research at Axiom Alternative Investments.
""We all know there's huge amounts of cash in the market, all of them are happy to put it to work on names like Nestle, especially when they are coming at levels investors never dreamed of a month ago.""
The Nestle bonds are set to price at 130 basis points over mid-swaps for the six-year paper and 150 bps over for the 10-year, which based on current Euribor levels suggests they will be priced to yield around 1.2% and 1.55% respectively.
Until very recently much of Nestle's shorter-dated debt was trading firmly below zero, while its 10-year bonds became the first of their type to trade at negative yields last August.
A banker involved in some of Tuesday's business said access to the market had always been there for such companies, rated comfortably within investment-grade, with the question being what yield levels corporate treasurers were willing to pay.
""The real question is when high-yield bond markets can reopen. We all know that's the sector that's been hit hardest by this crisis,"" he said. ""If the economy is hit as hard as we expect, I genuinely am not sure how that will play out without central bank support.""
Evidence of the economic devastation wreaked by the coronavirus pandemic mounted on Tuesday as surveys for March showed activity collapsing from Australia and Japan to Europe, with data from the United States expected to be just as dire.

670,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 24, 2020 08:12AM ET</span>",Coronavirus crisis rocks airlines and planemakers,"By Graham Fahy and Terje Solsvik
DUBLIN/OSLO (Reuters) - The grounding of virtually all flights by Europe's largest budget airline and European air traffic data on Tuesday highlighted the enormity of the shock to aviation industries from the coronavirus now emptying skies around the globe.
Ryanair (I:RYA) told customers it had virtually written off the next two months, while European air traffic management body Eurocontrol said volumes on Monday were down more than 75% from the same day last year.
""We do not expect to operate flights during the months of April and May at this time,"" Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary said in a message to customers.
The coronavirus pandemic is also taking a heavy toll on aerospace manufacturing, with Boeing (N:BA) saying it would halt production of most widebody jets and European rival Airbus (PA:AIR) resuming only partial output on Monday after a four-day shutdown as suppliers cut jobs.
With flights grounded because of a collapse in demand over fears of contagion and reinforced by air travel restrictions, airlines, planemakers and their suppliers are under pressure to save cash to ride out the squeeze in liquidity.
Ratings agency Moody's has cut its outlook for the aerospace and defence industry to negative from stable and warned that, the damaged balance sheets of most airlines would hurt demand for new aircraft even after the market begins a recovery.
Global passenger capacity fell 35% last week, the worst since the start of the crisis, according to data from airline schedules business OAG, which said deeper cuts are likely in the coming weeks. 
More than 2,500 planes have been grounded this year, data from Cirium shows, with taxiways, maintenance hangars and even runways at major airports turning into giant parking lots.
Asian jet fuel refining margins - the difference in value between raw crude and the refined product - turned negative on Tuesday for the first time in more than a decade, suggesting there was no recovery timeframe in sight for the aviation industry.
Large U.S. carriers have drafted plans for a possible halt in U.S. passenger air traffic, four officials said on condition of anonymity, though there is no plan in place and U.S. President Donald Trump said on Monday that he was not considering a domestic travel ban.
SHUTDOWNS
Boeing faces the shutdown of key assembly lines for the second time in a year after being forced to halt production of its grounded 737 MAX aircraft in January.
Production of long-haul jets such as the 787 and 777 in Washington state will pause for 14 days from Wednesday, plunging the world's largest industrial building - Boeing's wide-body plant at Everett north of Seattle - into silence for the first time in memory.
As the crisis deepens, Democratic U.S. lawmakers have proposed that some of the roughly $58 billion in proposed emergency aviation loans be changed to cash grants to cover payroll costs.
Embraer (SA:EMBR3), meanwhile, will furlough all non-essential workers in Brazil, where it makes regional jets, the world's third-largest aircraft manufacturer said on Sunday.
Joining the list of temporary shutdowns is Bombardier (TO:BBDb), which is suspending Canadian production of business jets, said a source familiar with the matter.
Airbus called for strong government support for airlines and suppliers but stopped short of calling for direct aid for the company, which has secured an extra 15 billion euros ($16.14 billion) of commercial credit lines.
However, the planemaker has told officials privately that it may need European government help if the crisis lasts for several months, Reuters reported last week.
Struggling Norwegian Air (OL:NWC), which has grounded most of its aircraft and temporarily laid off 90% of staff, said on Tuesday that it had secured an initial cash infusion of 300 million Norwegian crowns ($26.6 million) from the government. 
Industry executives said that a major source of alarm was the global chain of thousands of suppliers who would be severely hurt by abrupt stop-start movements in plane output. Many have already taken a hammering from the year-long 737 MAX grounding.
The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers on Monday said that more than 500,000 U.S. aerospace production jobs could be in jeopardy and called for a relief package that included provisions to protect against layoffs.

672,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 24, 2020 08:05AM ET</span>",Banks struggle to ride to the rescue in Europe's cash crunch battle,"By Andrea Mandala, Jesús Aguado and Tom Sims
MILAN/MADRID/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Corrado Sforza Fogliani is on the frontlines of European efforts to keep the region's economy alive amid the coronavirus pandemic.
His small cooperative bank, Banca di Piacenza, in Italy's virus-ravaged north, has been flooded with applications from customers seeking loan extensions, debt relief and renewal of credit lines.
Buried in paperwork and with Rome and banking lobbies still at odds over who should be on the hook for defaults when a six-month debt holiday ends, Banca di Piacenza's loan officers have only been able to process a fraction of the 1,000 applications they have received.
It's a scenario playing out in banks across the region -- default fears and bureaucratic hurdles slowing down what is meant to be a swift infusion of cash for hard-pressed businesses -- and it threatens Europe's efforts to rescue its flatlining economy. 
""The risk is that once we get through all this red tape the horse won't drink because it is no longer able to,"" Fogliani, Banca di Piacenza's executive chairman, said.
Faced with its worst crisis since the second world war, Europe is relying on banks to funnel a wall of money to businesses as countries impose lockdowns to stop the spread of the virus, snarling supply chains and decimating revenues.
Lenders' funding costs have been slashed, capital requirements have been relaxed and over 1 trillion euros has been pledged in loan guarantees and payment supports.
But for some European banks, which are still grappling with the legacy of the last financial crisis, the virus outbreak risks derailing their recovery.
Even with government guarantees, banks will still have to assume some risk of default which, on top of negative interest rates, will eat into already wafer-thin profit margins.  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), Germany's largest lender, which had finally been making progress on its turnaround, warned on Friday that the virus may mean it misses its targets.
And while passing on interest rate cuts is straight forward, making snap decisions on customer creditworthiness, hard to do at the best of times, is especially difficult when lenders are facing a deluge of applications and a depleted workforce logging on from home.
The range of challenges poses a threat to Europe's banks, whose share prices have already plumbed record lows, the companies they serve, and the broader European economy.
""I see the situation as a slow-moving systemic financial crisis. It is so slow-moving that you almost can watch it coming,"" said Jan Pieter Krahnen, professor of finance at Goethe University Frankfurt.
HAND OUT THE MONEY
In Spain, where virus deaths have surpassed 2,000, there is confusion about how much lenders must share in the burden of 100 billion euros in state-backed credit lines.
Banks are pushing for the state to guarantee on average 80% of the loans and for it to apply to both existing and new loans. Spain's Economy Minister Nadia Calvino said the government would discuss details of the state guarantees at a cabinet meeting on Tuesday. 
To encourage banks to provide a lifeline to businesses running out of cash, Italy's government is working on a guarantee covering 90% of new credit. 
Germany, whose export-dependent economy is highly exposed to the supply chain problems caused by the coronavirus, is offering unlimited funds to companies through its KfW bank, which was founded to finance the nation's rebuilding after World War II.
Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) said on Monday they had received thousands of queries from mainly small and medium-sized business clients for the KfW credits. 
""The phones are ringing off the hook,"" said Stefan Bender, head of Deutsche's corporate bank in Germany.
Amid the promise of funds, Thomas Giessing, head of a local savings bank in Heinsberg on the western-most edge of Germany, says he is fielding a surge of requests for debt relief from local businesses.
The region has been the hardest hit in Germany by the coronavirus. Some of its manufacturing firms have been unable to ship their goods or access raw materials because of supply chain problems and local tradesman such as plumbers and electricians have found it difficult to get work because of contagion fears.
Giessing, a former Olympic runner, understands that speed is required but after years of low margins caused by ultra-easy monetary policy, he is still unsure of what he can offer because the loans are only partially guaranteed by the government.
""This has left its mark on all sectors, big and small...All of us want to be able to supply companies with liquidity,"" he said.
KfW began accepting applications on Monday and said it should be able to process small loans in minutes, while loans of more than 10 million euros will take a week to 10 days. But some bankers fear it will weeks, not days, for credits to process. 
That is too slow, said Bettina Stark-Watzinger, a member of Germany's Bundestag finance committee.

""Flooding the market with money is not enough. You need the credit demand, and you can only have credit demand if you can hand out the money,"" she said.

674,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 24, 2020 08:01AM ET</span>",Fiat Chrysler to make face masks for North America,"MILAN (Reuters) - Italian-U.S. car giant Fiat Chrysler has confirmed plans to produce a million face masks a month and said it will distribute them to emergency services in North America to help the fight against coronavirus. 
FCA, which is also trying to help produce badly needed respirators for patients in intensive care in Italy, is one of a number of large manufacturers adapting production lines to make products in desperately short supply.
""Production capacity is being installed this week and the company will start manufacturing face masks in the coming weeks with initial distribution across the United States, Canada and Mexico,"" it said in a statement released late on Monday.
The monthly output of one million masks will be donated to police, emergency medical staff, firefighters and to workers in hospitals and health care clinics, it said.
The decision to begin distribution of masks in North America rather than Italy, the company's other home country, underlines the difficult balance global companies are having to maintain as they weigh where to offer help in the emergency.
Face masks and other protective equipment for medical staff have been running out across the world as thousands of new cases of the highly contagious virus have arrived in hospitals daily.
Fiat's position as a historic pillar of Italian industry makes the issue of where to provide help sensitive, especially as Italy is the country worst hit by the virus so far.
Both FCA and its controlling shareholder Exor, the investment firm of Italy's Agnelli family, have offered significant assistance to efforts to handle the crisis in Italy, where almost 6,000 people have died. 
FCA and luxury automaker Ferrari (NYSE:RACE), also controlled by Exor, are in talks with Siare, Italy's biggest respirator manufacturer, to help it double production of the life-saving machines. 
In addition, the Agnelli family said last week it was donating 10 million euros to fight the virus emergency in Italy.
It said companies controlled by Exor bought 150 ventilators and other medical equipment abroad, provided vehicles for support of people in need and were in touch with Italian authorities to help them buy medical equipment and healthcare products abroad.

As part of the process, an Exor spokesman said on Tuesday the group had made an initial purchase of 250,000 face masks in China which would be distributed in Italy and were expected to arrive by the end of this week.

(Reuters) - European shares attempted another rebound on Tuesday as a fresh wave of monetary and fiscal stimulus halted a global selloff in equity markets, but growing evidence of the economic damage from the coronavirus pandemic kept investors on edge.
In a co-ordinated global effort to stabilize financial markets in one of the biggest routs on record, Germany launched a stimulus package of up to 750 billion euros, while the U.S. Federal Reserve took unprecedented steps to shore up credit across the economy.
All the major country indexes rose in early trading, with Germany's DAX (GDAXI), Spain's IBEX (IBEX) and London's FTSE 100 (FTSE) adding between 3.5% and 5.2%. The pan-European STOXX 600 index jumped 4.2% and was set for its best day since August 2015.
""It is probably just a natural reaction to the extent of the losses in the last few sessions rather than any one thing,"" said Connor Campbell, analyst at spread better Spreadex in London.
""There's always a caveat attached to the morning part of the European session because the U.S. session can change things so much that often the afternoon can be unrecognizable from the morning.""
After see-sawing about 3% to 4% in both directions last week, the benchmark European index is still down more than 30% since its record high last month in one of the fastest-ever turns to a bear market.
With entire nations under lockdown foreshadowing more pain for factory activity and business confidence in the second quarter, investors have largely ignored macroeconomic data from the first quarter.
On Tuesday, traders hardly reacted to figures showing euro zone business activity crumbling in March as shops, restaurants and offices pulled down the shutters.
""If the global economy is a tin bucket filled with water, the coronavirus outbreak has drilled multiple holes into it and monetary policy bazookas are unable to stop the water from leaking away,"" said Lukman Otunuga, senior research analyst at FXTM.
""The solution may have to be a new bucket, which in this instance is a cure to the coronavirus.""
Italian stocks (FTMIB) surged 5.7%, as latest numbers showing a slowdown in new cases of COVID-19 raised hopes that the most aggressive phase of the outbreak may be passing.
Travel and leisure stocks (SXTP), which have posted some of the heaviest losses this month, rose 3.4%, while miners (SXPP), insurers (SXIP) and oil and gas stocks <.SEXP> jumped between 7% and 10%.
France's Biomérieux (PA:BIOX) was up 8.6% after the healthcare company won approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for its product aimed at testing for coronavirus.

Europe's fear gauge (V2TX) fell to 55.57, its lowest in nearly two weeks.

677,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 24, 2020 07:15AM ET</span>",Investors eye cracks in $4.4 trillion U.S. ETF market as virus sell-off rages,"By April Joyner
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wild swings in asset prices have thrown a spotlight on liquidity in corners of the $4.4 trillion market for U.S. exchange-traded funds, which have played a key role for investors in Wall Street's coronavirus-fueled selloff.
So far, ETFs - baskets of securities that are traded like stocks - have mostly functioned as intended, allowing investors to trade or hedge against further declines even during market gyrations. 
But trading in certain bond ETFs has begun to reflect evaporating liquidity in recent weeks. Because some bonds trade less frequently than the ETFs that hold them, the ETFs have at times traded at a markedly different price than the value of their underlying assets.
On one hand, the price reflected in the ETF often helps investors gauge the real-time value of underlying assets that trade infrequently or have halted trading, analysts said. 
But sparse liquidity could force investors to sell at deep discounts if an extended stock market plunge pushed investors to liquidate ETFs to raise cash - a phenomenon that has been seen in everything from gold to Treasury markets during the selloff.
""I still believe ETFs will work properly,"" said Spencer Mindlin, capital markets industry analyst at Aite Group in New York. ""But they haven't been tested in the environment like the one we're about to enter into.""
Trading in ETFs has comprised some 37% of daily volume on U.S. exchanges since Feb. 21, compared with an average of 26% in the year prior to that date, according to  State Street  (NYSE:STT) Global Advisors, which issues the popular SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (P:SPY). Both equity and fixed-income ETFs have traded three times their typical volume over the same period, reflecting the turbulent, high-volume trading seen on exchanges during the recent declines. 
Yet liquidity issues in some assets have been reflected in their corresponding ETFs.
Earlier this month, several bond ETFs, including the iShares iBoxx Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF (P:LQD) and the Vanguard Total Bond Market Index Fund ETF (O:BND), traded at significant discounts to their net asset value. 
The price dislocation has persisted in the VanEck Vectors High-Yield Municipal Index ETF (Z:HYD), which on Monday was trading at a 19.5% discount to its net asset value, according to Refinitiv data.
At the same time, ETF issuers have introduced cash redemption fees or raised existing ones in order to offset rising costs for trading certain bonds. 
Last week, BlackRock Inc (N:BLK) raised the fees it charges market makers to redeem shares of its iShares Short Maturity Bond ETF (Z:NEAR) for cash. In a similar move last week, Vanguard Group Inc introduced cash redemption fees for the Vanguard Mortgage-Backed Securities ETF (O:VMBS) and the Vanguard Total International Bond ETF (O:BNDX).
Those moves could place a further strain on liquidity, making these ETFs more difficult to trade, said Mohit Bajaj, director of ETF trading solutions at WallachBeth Capital, in emailed comments. 
Concerns over expenses for cash redemptions contributed to a steep drop in the iShares Short Maturity Bond ETF last week, Bajaj said. The ETF fell 6.2% on Thursday, though it has risen 2.6% over the last two sessions.
Also, borrow fees for several fixed-income ETFs have climbed for investors seeking to sell them short, according to research from market analytics firm S3 Partners, in a potential sign of diminishing supply, which could also contribute to liquidity concerns.
According to Refinitiv's Lipper, bond ETFs registered record weekly outflows last week. In the week ended Wednesday, taxable bond ETFs had $13.2 billion in net outflows, while municipal bond ETFs had $669 million. However, equity ETFs drew $1.9 billion in inflows.
Overall, massive exits from ETFs have not materialized, said Todd Rosenbluth, director of ETF and mutual fund research at CFRA in New York. Recent outflows have been modest compared to the total assets those funds hold, he said.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are set to post strong gains Tuesday, as investors expect the country’s political leaders to follow the lead set by the Federal Reserve and come up with a hefty stimulus to shore up the economy against the coronavirus pandemic.
At 7:00 AM ET (1100 GMT), futures for the three main U.S. indices are halted limit up, i.e. after having traded 5% higher. Still, the benchmark SPDR S&P 500 ETF (NYSE:SPY) traded 4.6% higher, the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF (NYSE:DIA) was up 4.3% and the Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ), a proxy for the Nasdaq, up 5.2%. The ETFs are not required to the same extent to be halted during wild swings.
The Federal Reserve announced a sweeping extension of its plans to backstop businesses and consumers on Monday by increasing its asset purchases by any volume necessary. 
Attention now turns to Capitol Hill, with the U.S. Senate expected to finally pass a coronavirus economic stimulus package, which could total as much as $2 trillion, despite failing so far to reach a bipartisan agreement amid arguments over spending priorities and the loose conditionality attached to federal aid for big business.
The latest economic data coming from Europe provided a reminder of the urgent need for such a package to be agreed. 
The IHS Markit’s measure of eurozone private-sector activity plunged to the lowest since the index was started -- and the currency bloc was formed -- more than two decades ago. 
“Business activity across the euro zone collapsed in March to an extent far exceeding that seen even at the height of the global financial crisis,” said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit. “Business sentiment about the year ahead has plunged to the gloomiest on record, suggesting policy makers’ efforts to date have failed to brighten the darkening picture.”
This doesn’t bode well for the equivalent U.S. numbers, due at 9:45 AM ET, with U.S. manufacturing and services PMIs also expected at multi-year lows.
In corporate news, oil giant  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) has announced plans to cut its 2020 capital spending by 20% while suspending its $5 billion share buyback. However, it will not cut its dividend.
Also in the spotlight will be the major U.S. airlines, amid reports that they  are drafting plans for a potential voluntary shutdown of virtually all passenger flights across the U.S..
Elsewhere, oil has bounced on hopes that the U.S. will strike a deal with Saudi Arabia after comments from U.S. Energy Secretary Dan Brouillette.
At 07:00 AM ET (1100 GMT), U.S. crude futures traded 5.7% higher at $24.68 a barrel. The international benchmark Brent contract rose 4.1% to $28.13.

Tesla's purchase comes as governments across the globe appeal to automakers and aerospace companies help procure or make ventilators and other medical equipment.
""China had an oversupply, so we bought 1255 FDA-approved ResMed, Philips &  Medtronic  (NYSE:MDT) ventilators on Friday night & airshipped them to LA,"" Musk said on Twitter.
California Governor Gavin Newsom on Tuesday said the state would receive 1,000 ventilators from Tesla as the United States braces to deal with an influx of patients infected by the coronavirus.
Authorities are hoping large-scale manufacturers can use their low-cost supply chains and digital design expertise, including 3D printing, and repurpose some factories in order to make up the expected shortfall in vital medical hardware.
Carmakers have cautioned that assembling delicate medical equipment to standards adequate for use in hospital intensive care units remains a challenge.

681,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 24, 2020 06:07AM ET</span>","StockBeat: The Harder the Fall, the Higher They Bounce","By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com  -- There’s a broad-based rebound in European stocks on Tuesday, and those performing best are largely those who had the biggest declines in recent weeks. 
By 6:10 AM ET (1010 GMT), the benchmark STOXX 600 was up  5.0% at 294.44, shrugging off the worst-ever drop in the eurozone purchasing managers index in March - a development which had been already priced in.
The Italian and Russian stock markets lead the way: Italy, because the country has now posted two straight days of declines in new Covid-19 infections and a slowdown in the mortality rates (although some doubts have been expressed about the reliability of the data). The FTSE MIB was up 6.7%
""This doesn't mean we can be sure the downshift in Italy will continue, but the data give real grounds for hope,"" Pantheon Macroeconomics' chief economist Ian Shepherdson said in a note to clients.  
Another factor lifting Italian assets is reports citing German officials as saying that they would approve a loan for the country from the European Stability Mechanism – the euro zone’s regional sovereign bailout fund – without significant conditions on its future fiscal and economic policy. 
Among the biggest gainers are Salvatore Ferragamo and Moncler. The two luxury groups had been among the worst hit by the collapse in Chinese demand when the Covid-19 outbreak began there. Things turned worse when the pandemic shut their production facilities in northern Italy down.
Salvatore Ferragamo (MI:SFER) shares were up 11.1% while Moncler (MI:MONC) shares were up 9.4%.
The 10-year yield spread spread with Germany, which peaked above 300 basis points last week, now appears to have stabilized below 200 basis points. Even so, both the Italian and other peripheral bond spreads are widening after German Economy Minister poured cold water on calls from Spain, Portugal and Italy in the last week for the euro zone to issue debt jointly ('corona bonds'), something that's still taboo in Germany and elsewhere in northern Europe.
Russia, meanwhile, is bouncing because crude oil is up on hopes that the U.S. will make some kind of diplomatic move to end the price war, and because the worldwide rush for dollars appears to be easing in the wake of the Federal Reserve’s decision to open the liquidity taps even further on Monday with its announcement of unlimited quantitative easing and its first-ever purchases of corporate debt. Both those factors have stabilized the ruble, which is now back at 78.8 to the dollar, having touched 81.0 last week. The RTS index was up 8.1%
The biggest gainers in Russia are, however, not oil companies but miners. Norilsk Nickel (MCX:GMKN) was up 15.0%, as prices for platinum group metals found a bottom – at least temporarily -  and gold and silver miner  Polymetal  International PLC (LON:POLYP) was up 11.8%, reflecting sharp rebounds in those metals as forced selling of speculative positions abated.
Elsewhere,  BP  (LON:BP) rose 27% on hopes that it will avoid cutting its dividend, while Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) stock and  Total  SA (PA:TOTF) stock added to Monday’s gains after announcements.  Anglo American  (LON:AAL) stock rose 8.0% and  Rio Tinto  (LON:RIO) stock rose 7.3%, shrugging off announcements that they had had to suspend operations in South Africa due to public health measures. Rio has also had to limit operations in Quebec, Canada.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Monday ordered Britons to stay at home to halt the spread of the virus, imposing curbs on everyday life without precedent in peacetime. But people would still be allowed to leave their homes to shop for basic necessities.
The Waitrose supermarket chain said that from Tuesday its supermarkets and convenience shops would begin to limit customer numbers. It said limits will be specific to each branch based on the number of tills. “Shop managers will use their judgment on customer numbers and when the shop is at capacity to manage social distancing will operate a one in, one out policy,” Waitrose said. Waitrose, part of the John Lewis Partnership [JLPLC.UL], is also using “marshals” to help manage queues outside shops and if necessary remind customers to respect the government's social distancing rule requiring people to keep at least 2 meters apart from each other. Morrisons, Britain’s fourth biggest supermarket group, is also limiting customer numbers. “We have signs about social distancing in the store and on those signs it does say we might from time to time limit the number of people that actually come in,” said a spokesman.
Sainsbury's, the No. 2 player, said it is finalizing plans to limit customer numbers.
On Monday, Morrisons installed large perspex screens at all checkouts in all of its stores to shield customers and checkout staff from each other.
Waitrose and discounter Lidl also plan to install screens.

All supermarkets are asking customers to pay with card rather than cash at tills as a way to help contain the spread of the virus, which has killed 336 people in Britain and infected more than 6,600.

Germany allows companies to apply for state aid to keep people working but switch to shorter hours.
A Puma spokeswoman said almost all the shops that Puma and its partners operate had been closed due to the coronavirus.
Employees at the company's headquarters in the southern German town of Herzogenaurach and in its own stores will now work only half of their usual hours, but will still be paid their full salary due to the short-time work allowance.
Chief Executive Bjorn Gulden, finance chief Michael Laemmermann and sourcing chief Anne-Laure Descours will waive their April salaries, together worth about 170,000 euros ($183,821.00), while the next management level will waive a quarter of their salary.
The three executives were paid a total of 2 million euros in 2019.

Puma said earlier this month it was abandoning the 2020 guidance it gave on Feb. 19 that had assumed the crisis would be short-lived.

Norway said on March 19 that Norwegian Air could obtain credit guarantees worth up to 3 billion crowns to help it weather the coronavirus crisis subject to a series of conditions.
Norwegian, which has grounded most of its aircraft and temporarily laid off 90% of staff, amounting to about 7,300 people, had said it needed access to cash ""within weeks, not months"".
A condition for receiving the first 300 million crowns from Norway's rescue package was that commercial lenders were willing to supply 10% of that amount while the government would provide the remaining 90%.
""Norwegian is pleased to announce that two Nordic banks have obtained credit committee approval to provide a guarantee for the required 10%,"" a company statement said.
""Norwegian will secure the necessary headroom to pursue further guarantees from the Norwegian government.""
Norwegian's shares rose following the announcement, trading up almost 5% at 9.36 Norwegian crowns ($0.87) at 0852 GMT.
On Monday, leasing company DP Aircraft (L:DPAD) said a unit of Norwegian Air had failed to make payments relating to two Boeing (NYSE:BA) 787 Dreamliner aircraft in its fleet, which had been due on March 13.
DP Aircraft and its asset manager, DS Aviation, will prioritize discussions with Norwegian ""in order to determine whether and on what basis it may be able to meet its obligations,"" DP said.
Norwegian did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Tuesday.
FURTHER FUNDS
The airline is now working with state credit agency GIEK and Norway's trade and industry ministry to clarify the criteria and terms for receiving the remaining tranches of the scheme, it said.
A tranche of 1.2 billion crowns is dependent on creditors postponing installments and scrapping interest payments for as long as the guarantee lasts.
Another of 1.5 billion crowns would require Norwegian to boost its equity, the government has said.
The company said it is now seeking further guarantees from financial institutions to help it access these tranches.

""The government guarantee scheme is crucial for the company as the current state of the capital markets in combination with the challenging times for the airline industry limit the options available,"" Norwegian said.

Investing.com - European stock markets pushed sharply higher, helped by the U.S. Federal Reserve’s latest attempt to calm the markets and the expectation of similar help by its European counterpart.
At 03:20 ET (0820 GMT), the U.K.'s FTSE index traded 3.6% higher, France's CAC 40 was up 3.9%, while the DAX gained 5%. The broader based Stoxx 600 Europe index gained 3.9%.
The Federal Reserve announced Monday a sweeping extension of its plans to backstop businesses and consumers by increasing its asset purchases by any volume necessary. This followed the inability of Congress - for a second day - to agree on a $1 trillion-plus economic support package drafted by Senate Republicans.
At the same time, the European Central Bank intends to be a major buyer of commercial paper when it enters that market this week, ECB policymaker Francois Villeroy de Galhau said in an interview with French website Wansquare.
The ECB's latest package of crisis measures opens the way for it to buy debt of less than six months for the first time down to debt as short as one month.
Central banks have had to be aggressive with their policy measures as the latest economic releases paint a grim picture about the damage being inflicted by the coronavirus pandemic.
Activity surveys for March from Australia and Japan showed record falls earlier Tuesday, and surveys in Europe and the United States are expected to be just as weak.
Purchasing Managers' Index surveys from Japan for March showed the services sector shrinking at its fastest pace on record and factory activity contracting at its quickest in a decade. In Australia, the CBA Services PMI fell to a record low.
Later on Tuesday, the eurozone composite PMI is expected to come in at the lowest since early 2009, at 5:00 AM ET (0900 GMT), as the German data has done, while U.S. manufacturing and services PMIs are also expected at multi-year lows, at 9:45 AM ET.

Investing.com - European stock markets are set to open higher Tuesday, following Asia upwards, after the U.S. Federal Reserve’s latest attempt to calm the markets. However, these gains could be short-lived as evidence mounts of the devastation wrought on the global economy by the coronavirus pandemic.
At 3:15 ET (0715 GMT), the DAX futures contract traded 4.0% higher. {{167|France's CACAC 40 futures were up 3.9%, while the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. rose 4.4%. 
The Federal Reserve announced Monday a sweeping extension of its plans to backstop businesses and consumers by increasing its asset purchases by any volume necessary. This followed the inability of Congress - for a second day - to agree on a $1 trillion-plus economic support package drafted by Senate Republicans. 
The Fed's announcement was greeted with skepticism on Wall Street - all three major U.S. equity indices closed lower Monday - but Asian markets received it more favorably.
At 3:15 AM ET, the benchmark Shanghai index in China traded up 2.4%, the Hang Seng in Hong Kong up 4.5%, the KOSPI 50 in South Korea up 8.6%, while the Nikkei in Japan closed 7% higher and the S&P/ASX 200 in Australia ended up 4.2%.
However, the latest economic releases paint a grim picture about the damage being inflicted by the coronavirus pandemic as activity surveys for March from Australia and Japan showed record falls, and surveys in Europe and the United States are expected to be just as weak.
Purchasing Managers' Index surveys from Japan for March showed the services sector shrinking at its fastest pace on record and factory activity contracting at its quickest in a decade. In Australia, the CBA Services PMI fell to a record low.
Later on Tuesday, the eurozone composite PMI is expected to come in at the lowest since early 2009, at 5:00 AM ET (0900 GMT), while U.S. manufacturing and services PMIs are also expected at multi-year lows, at 9:45 AM ET.
Oil rallied Tuesday amid speculation of an alliance between the U.S. and Saudi Arabia, the two largest producers in the world, to stabilize prices, prompted by comments from U.S. Energy Secretary Dan Brouillette.
“At some point we will engage in a diplomatic effort down the road. But no decisions have been made on anything of that nature,” said Brouillette Monday.
At 3:00 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 5% higher at $24.52 a barrel. The international benchmark Brent contract rose 3.8% to $28.05.
Elsewhere, gold futures rose 1.9% to $1,597.55/oz, their highest in nearly two weeks, while EUR/USD traded at 1.0830, up 1% on the day as the dollar retreated from recent highs.

The easing comes as containment efforts increased elsewhere, with nations from the U.K. to South Africa implementing stay-at-home policies.
President Donald Trump said the U.S. economy can’t remain slowed for too long. Financial markets rebounded after the Federal Reserve unveiled unprecedented measures, taking action as Congress continued to argue over stimulus.
The Olympics moved closer to postponement. German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s first coronavirus test came back negative.

Virus Explosion in Australia Exposes Cruise Ship Menace (2:03 p.m. HK)
Coronavirus cases in Australia from a single infected cruise ship exploded, highlighting again the dangers the vessels pose to governments fighting the spread of the virus.
The number of infections from the Ruby Princess, which docked in Sydney on March 19, has reached 133, Australian health authorities said. One woman in her 70s has died. The ship accounts for 7.3% of all cases in the country, where infections are soaring.
The Princess Cruises-operated vessel is just the latest cruiseliner to become a hotbed for the virus. More than 700 people were infected on another Princess Cruises-run vessel off Japan in the early days of the outbreak.
European Airports Face $15 Billion Revenue Loss (1:56 p.m. HK)
European airports will lose more than 700 million passengers in 2020, resulting in a 14 billion euro ($15 billion) hit to revenue for airport operators, according to industry groups.
The forecast is based on travel restrictions being lifted toward the end of April and demand gradually recovering, associations representing airports, caterers, retailers and ground handlers wrote in a joint letter to the European Commission. The financial hit is for airport operators alone, and doesn’t take into account “the massive losses that the other service providers at airports will inevitably incur.”
China to Lift Lockdown in Wuhan on April 8 (1:26 p.m. HK)
China’s Hubei province said it will allow transportation to resume for the city of Wuhan on April 8, effectively lifting a mass quarantine over the city where the coronavirus first emerged last December.
People in Wuhan will be allowed to leave the city and Hubei province, according to a statement on the provincial government’s website Tuesday.
The easing of restrictions comes as Hubei reported that new infections dropped to zero on March 19, a dramatic plunge from the height of an epidemic that’s infected more than 80,000 Chinese and killed over 3,200.
Thailand Cases Climb to 827 (11:21 a.m. HK)
Thailand said confirmed coronavirus infections jumped by 106 to 827, and three more people died. Cases have surged this month, leading to a partial shutdown of much of the country, including in Bangkok.
Many of the new cases are linked to clusters from a boxing stadium event, foreign travel and the tourism and service industries. Four involve health- care workers.
The latest fatalities take the death toll to four, Taweesilp Witsanuyotin, a spokesman for the Health Ministry, said in a briefing.
Southwest Air Cuts 1,500 Daily Flights (11:10 a.m. HK)
Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) Co. will scrub 1,500 flights from its daily schedule, 500 more than planned just days ago, because it is only filling about 20% of seats on its planes as the coronavirus slams demand. Southwest’s rapid escalation reflects the severity of the drop in travel demand that has impacted airlines around the world. The four largest U.S. airlines had cut about 5,000 flights by midday Monday.

The New York metropolitan area, the center of the outbreak in the U.S., has a higher infection rate than in the rest of the country and a greater share of tests that come out positive, said Deborah Birx, a member of the Trump administration’s coronavirus task force. The attack rate in the region is close to one in 1,000, five times what other areas are seeing, Birx said a Trump press briefing. About 28% of the submitted tests are positive, compared with less than 8% in the rest of the country, she said.
“Clearly the virus had been circulating there for a number of weeks to have this level of penetrance into the general community,” Birx said.
FDA Lifts Curbs on Maker of Drug Touted by Trump (9:22 a.m. HK)
U.S. regulators have lifted import restrictions on an Indian pharmaceutical company in an effort to increase supplies of a malaria drug touted by President Donald Trump as a potential coronavirus treatment.
Mumbai-based Ipca Laboratories Ltd. said in a March 21 securities filing that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration “has made exception to the import alert” for three of its facilities, allowing it to supply tablets as well as raw materials for making chloroquine phosphate and hydroxychloroquine sulphate.
The U.S. is facing possible shortages of both drugs, which are also widely prescribed to treat rheumatoid arthritis and lupus. Hospitals have been stocking up on the treatments in recent weeks following reports from doctors outside the U.S. that they were effective against Covid-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. There have been no large-scale clinical trials to support those claims.
Washington State Shuts Down (8:52 a.m. HK)
Washington State Governor Jay Inslee issued a stay-at-home order that begins in 48 hours and will be in force for at least two weeks. The order bans all gatherings and shutters non-essential businesses. Grocery and pharmacy shopping, doctor appointments and restaurant takeout will still be allowed.
The actions come on a day in which Seattle and King County announced 12 fatalities, the largest single-day death toll yet in that area, and Boeing (NYSE:BA) shut down in-state production after a worker at its Everett plant died of Covid-19 yesterday. There are 2,221 confirmed cases of Covid-19 in Washington State, according to the Department of Health, and 110 deaths.
The step follows similar actions by New York and California, but also by states that have fewer infections than Washington such as Oregon and West Virginia.
China’s Imported Cases Almost Double (8:20 a.m. HK)
China reported 78 additional coronavirus cases for March 23, with 74 of them from abroad, according to statement from the country’s National Health Commission. The other four, including one from Wuhan, are locally reported cases.
While the number of local cases in China has been dwindling, reaching zero in recent days, the number of imported infections has been rising. The latest figure is almost double the number of imported cases reported a day earlier.
China now has 81,171 total confirmed coronavirus cases. The nation’s death toll rose by seven to 3,277. All the latest fatalities are from Hubei. Discharged patients rose by 456 to 73,159.
Trump Says First Lady Tested Negative for Virus (8:17 a.m. HK)

Trump Says Boeing Will Need Help (8:12 a.m. HK)
U.S. President Donald Trump said  Boeing Co . will need government “help” amid the economic slowdown stemming from the coronavirus crisis that has hit the travel industry.
“Boeing’s going to need some help,” Trump said at a White House news conference. “Obviously the airlines are going to have a problem, but the airlines aren’t going to be buying from Boeing or anybody else right now because of this difficulty.”
The planemaker announced Monday that it is shutting its Seattle-area manufacturing hub for two weeks after a worker died of coronavirus complications, adding to a wave of plant closings sweeping the globe as the aviation industry navigates the biggest disruption in decades.
AB InBev Withdraws Outlook on Virus Impact (7:25 a.m. HK)

While Chancellor Angela Merkel has said she’s happy to discuss Italy’s request for jointly issued coronavirus bonds to shore up euro members’ finances, the official said Germany isn’t ready to move forward with that idea.

The S&P BSE Sensex Index advanced 1% to 26,239.96 as of 9:47 a.m. in Mumbai, and the NSE Nifty 50 Index also rose 1%. Both gauges fell 13% in the previous trading session -- their biggest ever one-day decline -- as the country’s coronavirus-linked cases surpassed 400. The MSCI Asia Pacific Index gained 3.4% on Tuesday as regional stocks rebounded.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi and state leaders over the weekend imposed an almost complete lockdown, which will probably worsen an economy already growing at its slowest pace in more than a decade. India has 467 virus cases so far, including seven deaths. But experts say the country could be on the same trajectory as Italy, where the outbreak quickly escalated, causing hospitals to overflow.

Oxford Economics has slashed India’s growth forecast for January to April to 3%, a number not seen even during the worst of the global financial crisis, even as the government weighs the possibility of a fiscal stimulus to support the economy. Meanwhile, the central bank last week announced measures to boost liquidity while holding back from following global peers with a rate cut.
In an effort to support the domestic market, the Securities and Exchange Board of India has lowered the compliance burden on market participants, including extending risk management framework deadlines for mutual funds. The regulator last week raised margin requirements and capped derivatives exposure for a month in a bid to subdue market volatility.
Foreign investors have sold $6.7 billion worth of Indian equities in March, on track for a record monthly withdrawal, according to data compiled by Bloomberg dating back to 1999.

The company might also sell a stake in its telecommunications arm, as well as its investment in Sprint, the source said. 
The Alibaba stake sale could range from as little as US$12 billion to as much as US$15 billion, according to the article.

TOKYO/HONG KONG (Reuters) - SoftBank Group Corp (T:9984) stock jumped 20% on Tuesday, extending a run that began a day earlier when the Japanese tech investor announced up to $41 billion in asset sales and a record share buyback to shore up its collapsing share price.
SoftBank shares ended Monday up 19%, hitting their daily limit, after the conglomerate said in the early afternoon it would buy back up to 2 trillion yen ($18 billion) worth of shares in addition to an up to 500 billion yen purchase announced earlier this month.
Chief Executive Masayoshi Son's foray into investing in late-stage startups via SoftBank's $100 billion Vision Fund has hammered the firm's shares as major bets soured, forcing a sell-down of core parts of its portfolio and buybacks - moves long sought by investors pushing for enhanced shareholder returns. 
""We would have ideally preferred such an announcement from a position of strength and not because the (SoftBank) stock came under tremendous pressure,"" Jefferies analyst Atul Goyal wrote in a note, upgrading his SoftBank stock rating to ""buy"".
Selling down SoftBank's stake in domestic wireless carrier SoftBank Corp (T:9434) to 50% could raise around $10 billion while retaining control of the company, Goyal wrote.
SoftBank also owns 25% of Chinese e-commerce major  Alibaba  Group Holding Ltd (N:BABA) (HK:9988) - a stake currently worth around $120 billion.
Alibaba's New York-listed shares have declined 17% year-to date.
A partial sale of SoftBank's stake is likely, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters, with shares likely to be sold into the open market rather than back to the company.
Alibaba buying back shares from SoftBank will not please its shareholders, ""you are only making Masa Son happy. SoftBank wants to sell urgently but Alibaba is not in such a rush,"" the person said, who was not authorized to speak with media on the matter and so declined to be identified.

Alibaba declined to comment. SoftBank did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

696,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 23, 2020 09:35PM ET</span>",Wells Fargo to pay special compensation to front-line workers amid coronavirus outbreak,"By Imani Moise
(Reuters) -  Wells Fargo  & Co (N:WFC) will join other large U.S. banks in paying out special compensation to front-line employees, according to a memo seen on Monday by Reuters.
The San Francisco-based bank said all of its domestic full-time employees who make less than $100,000 a year would receive a pre-tax payment of $600 and part-time employees would get a $300 bonus. 
Front-line employees like branch workers, call-center staff and technology specialists who are required to come into the office as others work from home because of the coronavirus outbreak will receive an additional $200 per pay period starting April 17 for up to five paychecks, the memo said.
Management has also decided not to pay out a discretionary profit-sharing 401(k) contribution for 2019, citing the bank's financial performance last year and the ""extraordinary environment,"" said the memo signed by Chief Executive Charlie Scharf.
A Wells Fargo spokeswoman confirmed the contents of the memo.
Banks have largely been excluded from government-mandated shutdowns across the country because they are considered an essential industry by the federal government, meaning most bank branches, call centers and trading floors have stayed open even as many firms send their employees home.
""During this global public health emergency, we are especially grateful for those of you who continue to come into our branches, contact centers and other offices to serve customers and colleagues,"" the memo said.
Earlier on Monday,  Citigroup  Inc (N:C) said it would pay $1,000 to U.S. employees who make $60,000 or less in base salary.
JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM), the largest U.S. bank by assets, said in a memo on Friday it would give workers who are staffing branches and call centers through the coronavirus pandemic a onetime $1,000 bonus.

Bank of America Corp (N:BAC) will also pay an additional $200 per pay period to front-line workers in branches, call centers and operation centers, with enhanced overtime pay, according to a memo seen by Reuters on Friday.

McDonald's, which had shut its dining rooms, extended closures to include take-out and drive-thrus, which have been spared so far in the United States.
In Britain, customers formed long queues in their cars, snaking around corners as they waited to get a last Big Mac from McDonald's drive-thrus before closings on Monday.
People shared pictures of their last McDonald’s meals on Twitter, with one user in Glasgow saying she had sworn to eat healthier but “decided to have one last one for a while.” Her picture show a Quarter Pounder with Cheese, fries and a drink.
Earlier this month, France ordered restaurants shuttered.
McDonald's said that executives in each of its 119 markets are monitoring local conditions in their countries and making decisions about how to operate as the coronavirus prompts widespread closures globally.
""Decisions on restaurant operations are made at the market level based on the unique situations in those communities,"" it said in a statement to Reuters, declining further comment.
During systemwide calls with its more than 1,600 U.S. franchisees, McDonald's executives said closing stores would be a last resort, according to a person who participated in the calls.
The corporate executives said they do not want franchisees to go out of business, that ""no owner will be lost"" as a result of the deadly outbreak, the person said.
The company did not immediately reply to a request for comment.
To be sure, some restaurant are scaling up instead of down. Papa Johns International Inc said on Monday that it will hire 20,000 workers as U.S. customers order pizza delivery - now with ""zero contact"" between driver and customer - while isolating themselves at home.
 Starbucks Corp  (NASDAQ:SBUX) has also reopened most of its locations in China, where the deadly outbreak began.
On March 16, McDonald's closed dining rooms in its corporate-owned U.S. stores - which make up 5% of its approximately 14,000 locations - allowing only drive-thru, delivery and take-out orders.
Shutting down McDonald's whole U.S. market would be a major undertaking, former franchisee Jim Lewis said.
""That's just not an easy shutdown,"" he said.

By comparison, the United Kingdom and Ireland have only about 1,270 locations.

The purchases by Eyal Ofer and Arne Alexander Wilhelmsen came as a syndicate of banks comprising  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS), JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM), Bank of America (N:BAC),  BNP Paribas  SA (PA:BNPP) and Goldman Sachs (N:GS) agreed to arrange the new one-year loan.
Wilhelmsen is Royal Caribbean's largest shareholder with an approximately 11% stake in the company.
U.S. companies have been rushing to borrow more money and boost their cash coffers, as economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic hits their business and threatens a prolonged downturn.
The cruise industry has been among the worst affected sectors, as many operators halted operations due to travel restrictions imposed to curb the spread of the virus.
With the new secured term loan facility, Royal Caribbean said it had over $3.6 billion in liquidity, including cash deposits and its existing undrawn revolving credit facilities.
""This is a period of unprecedented disruption for the cruise industry. We continue to take decisive actions to protect the company's financial and liquidity positions as they enable us to keep focused on our guests, our crew and our long-term plans,"" Chief Financial Officer Jason Liberty said in a statement.
Earlier this month, the company raised its credit capacity by $550 million and said it would cut spending, operating expenses and take other actions to improve liquidity by at least another $1.7 billion in 2020.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Liquidity at a $2.2 billion prime money-market fund run by  Northern Trust  Corp (NASDAQ:NTRS) fell below the key 30% U.S. regulatory threshold twice last week, but rebounded above that level after the U.S. Federal Reserve shored up the industry. 
As the coronavirus roils the global economy and squeezes Wall Street for cash, money-market reforms put in place after the 2007-2009 financial crisis are weathering a major test.
Several institutional prime funds, whose investors include large corporations, were at risk of falling below the 30% threshold before the Fed took extraordinary steps reminiscent of the last financial crisis to backstop the money-market industry.
The Northern Prime Obligations Portfolio disclosed that its weekly liquidity level fell to 27% of assets twice last week, according to the fund's website - reducing its buffer for quickly converting assets into cash to meet investors' redemptions. 
However, Chicago-based Northern Trust, a bank and wealth manager, said on Monday the latest weekly liquidity level for the fund was nearly 41%.
The Fed's action gave Wall Street confidence to buy short-term corporate debt, releasing pressure on a market that seized up last week amid a global panic.
Prime institutional money fund assets last week fell 16% to $271 billion. While these funds make up a small slice of the $3.8 trillion U.S. money-market fund industry, they are a key barometer of the health of the market for short-term, highly-rated corporate debt.
""On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve Board announced the establishment of a Money Market Fund Liquidity Facility,"" Northern Trust spokesman Doug Holt said. ""This has been helpful to facilitate liquidity for institutional and retail prime money market funds that want to sell credit investments.""
Funds are required to be able to convert at least 30% of their assets into cash within five business days to meet investor redemption requests.
Last week,  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) injected more than $1.8 billion into two prime money-market funds suffering heavy withdrawals. [nL1N2BE0BV]
And JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM)'s $45.6 billion Prime Money Market Fund weathered nearly $13 billion in withdrawals last week, pushing down its weekly liquidity ratio to 35% on Friday, from 40% earlier in the week, JPMorgan disclosures show.
Assets in the Northern Prime Obligations Portfolio have plunged more than 40% this month. Net withdrawals of $1.1 billion during a four-day stretch last week dragged down the fund's weekly liquid assets.
The 30% threshold has become the most important metric tracked by institutional investors in prime money-market funds, said Pete Crane, president of money fund research firm Crane Data LLC.
A fund's weekly liquidity level is published daily by prime money market funds. BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) called the ratio an ""amber flashing light"" for investors, in a report published this month for its clients. 
If a fund's weekly liquid assets drop below 30%, its board has the discretion to introduce redemption fees of up to 2% to slow investor withdrawals. It also could halt redemptions with so-called gates for up to 10 business days to insulate the fund from a redemption run, according to rules set by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission after the last financial crisis.
Another post-crisis rule change allows the net asset value of prime money-market funds to fluctuate. The floating NAV rule gives funds some relief if the value of their shares fall below $1 apiece, which is known as ""breaking the buck.""
""Investors are getting used to it. There's no longer a break the buck mentality anymore,"" Fitch Ratings analyst Greg Fayvilevich said, referring to prime funds.
Now, it is all about their liquidity levels, he added.

NEW YORK/DETROIT (Reuters) - Auto retailers have been slow to embrace e-commerce, but the coronavirus pandemic is changing that.
Online traffic has risen even as in-person showroom traffic has disappeared. Auto dealers are embracing digital tools to close deals without a handshake and arranging for vehicles to be picked up or delivered without requiring customers to come to their stores. 
U.S. new vehicle sales will be hit hard by the pandemic. Demand dropped 13% in the first 19 days of March, according to research firm J.D. Power. In especially hard-hit markets like Seattle, San Francisco, Los Angeles and Chicago, where the virus has spread quickly, demand slumped as much as 22%. 
Moody's Analytics said on Friday the new and used vehicle markets could slump by as much as 20% from 2019 levels and stay depressed into 2021. 
Based on a survey of some 40 dealers, analysts at Evercore ISI on Monday estimated the March U.S. seasonally adjusted annual selling rate could be 11 million to 12 million vehicles, on par with levels seen during the 2008/2009 financial crisis.
However, online traffic for the 1,000 U.S. and Canadian dealers served by Roadster, which provides a digital sales platform for everything from financing paperwork to vehicle delivery, was up about 6%.
""Many dealerships are going to get caught with their pants down,"" said Brian Benstock, a dealer in the New York City borough of Queens. ""This will be a watershed moment for the dealership industry.""
Dealers have been doing business online for years, but it has never been a major focus. Only 15% of all transactions are online, according to a November survey of 540 dealers commissioned by the National Automobile Dealers Association. However, they expect online car sales to double by 2025.
Benstock, who began moving most of his sales online in 2015, said companies like Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc and retailer Carvana Co, which does all its business online, have begun to change consumer expectations. 
Tesla has always relied on internet orders for its vehicles. It is implementing ""touchless deliveries"" in many locations, allowing consumers to unlock cars using the Tesla App, sign any relevant paperwork and return it to a drop-off location. 
Carvana, which sells used vehicles, expanded the number of cars it sold to retail customers by 89% in 2019 from 2018. 
Despite a sharp decline in its shares, Carvana has a market capitalization twice that of AutoNation Inc (NYSE:AN), the largest bricks and mortar U.S. retail vehicle chain. AutoNation started boosting investment in its online selling capability well before the virus shock.
David Smith, chief executive of dealership chain Sonic Automotive Inc, said most customers still want to visit a showroom to see the cars they are buying.
“There’s only a small percentage of the market who want to buy their car entirely online and have it delivered,” he said.
Cox Automotive analyst Michelle Krebs said the outbreak will accelerate the wider adoption of services that allow customers to stay away from showrooms.
""It's what people wanted going into this,"" she said, citing a Cox January survey that found consumers cited vehicle pick-up and delivery as their top desire. 
Matthew Zappone, general manager of a Chrysler Jeep Dodge Ram dealer outside of Albany, New York, is encouraging his sales staff to use FaceTime to show customers the vehicle features they want to see without visiting the store.

""If you haven't been doing it to this point, you're under-prepared,"" Zappone said.

President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador backed the weekend vote in the northern city of Mexicali, as he has in other high-profile projects including a partially built airport, as an exercise in local control.
""They have to respect the decision of the people. I think (the company) will understand when there's a result like this one,"" Lopez Obrador told his regular morning news conference.
Constellation's shares tumbled 12% on Monday to close just above $105, down from a previous high of $208 on Feb. 20.
Lopez Obrador said his support for the result of the local referendum did not mean his government opposes foreign private investment, adding that he planned to discuss an alternative site for the brewery with Constellation.
Constellation did not immediately reply to a request for comment. Earlier this month, the U.S.-based company said it would consider other locations if Mexico became problematic.
The results came as the Mexican peso hit a new low against the U.S. dollar, trading at 25 pesos per greenback for the first time ever.
""That may be due to a larger perception of risk in Mexico"" driven by the vote, said Gabriela Siller, head of economic analysis for Mexico City-based Banco Base.
Several prominent Mexican business lobbies blasted the referendum process, saying it would generate uncertainty and hurt investment at a time when Mexico's economy is weak and could be further damaged by coronavirus.
Lopez Obrador's critics have panned past referendums as reflecting the will of only a tiny fraction of voters, lacking legitimacy due to the political parties behind them, and undermining private investment decisions. 
Local activists in Mexicali, just across the U.S. border, argued that the project put water supplies at risk.
Constellation, which brews Modelo, Corona and other Mexican beers for export to mostly American drinkers, has countered that the brewery would affect less than 1% of local water supplies, and that the plant had all the requisite permits. 
A Mexican government official said that under Chapter 14 of the newly ratified United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, the project cancellation could be considered an indirect expropriation if the U.S. government wanted to pursue the matter.

""Surely the U.S. government is directly talking to the Mexican foreign ministry about this,"" the person said, speaking on condition of anonymity as he was not authorized to speak on the matter.

(Reuters) - Streaming provider FuboTV said on Monday that it had agreed to merge with virtual entertainment firm FaceBank Group Inc (PK:FBNK) to expand its over-the-top TV footprint, in a deal that sources said valued privately held FuboTV at about $700 million.
It is a rare example of a merger clinched amid the market turmoil and economic uncertainty fueled by the coronavirus pandemic. More people staying at home during the outbreak will be a boon to the combined company, FaceBank's chief executive, John Textor, said in an interview.
""FuboTV is one of those companies that we see is likely to do well in this environment,"" Textor said. ""Their content and the offerings are considerably less expensive than the cable options.""
FaceBank has a market capitalisation of more than $200 million and is controlled by Textor and FaceBank's chairman and fellow co-founder, Alexander Bafer.
FaceBank also raised $100 million from its shareholder group to support future expansion, according to company filings. The combined company will be led by FuboTV CEO David Gandler.
Founded in 2015, FuboTV has raised over $250 million from media companies including AMC Networks, Discovery Inc, Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co and Viacom Inc. It has about 300,000 to 400,000 paid subscribers, according to one of the sources.
FuboTV started as a sports-focused streaming service and has been expanding to news and entertainment as it adds channels like CBSN, The CW and Pop. Last year, it launched free and ad-supported streaming channels in addition to a paid subscription.
FaceBank is a developer of hyper-realistic characters and digital humans by emerging technologies, like virtual reality, augmented reality and artificial intelligence. Last year, it bought Nexway AG, an e-commerce and payment platform with footprint in 180 countries.
FaceBank said it started to work with FuboTV on the all-stock deal in January and expects to close it by the end of this month. FuboTV plans to leverage FaceBank's distribution for international expansion and develop more strategic partners like Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and American airlines, as it faces off against a growing mix of over-the-counter TV competitors that include AT&T, DirecTV, Hulu, YouTube TV and Sling TV, FaceBank said.

706,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 23, 2020 05:30PM ET</span>",Explainer: How the Fed's latest move will get money to Main Street,"By Jonnelle Marte
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Reserve said on Monday it would backstop an unprecedented range of credit for households, small businesses and major employers in an attempt to stop the economy from sliding into depression as the coronavirus spreads. 
The Fed is creating new programs for the nearly 5,200 FDIC- insured U.S. banks, as well as finance companies and corporations to stave off business bankruptcies and keep employee paychecks flowing. They include lending against student loans, credit card loans and U.S. government backed-loans to small businesses, as well as new programs to buy bonds of larger employers and make loans to them.
The series of actions marks a massive intervention by the U.S. central bank beyond the financial markets, where it has so far concentrated its firepower, into the real U.S. economy.
""It's their bazooka moment,"" said Russell Price, chief economist at Ameriprise Financial (NYSE:AMP) Services in Troy, Michigan.
Many of the details are yet to be finalized, and it remains unclear how quickly that money can flow to small businesses. But here is what is known so far about how the Fed's latest efforts can indirectly get cash to households and small businesses. 
1) Help large companies stay in operation. 
Companies of all sizes are taking a hit to their bottom lines as factories shut down, retail stores shutter and business overall is put on hold. Through the newly created primary market corporate credit facility, the Fed will serve as a backstop for corporate debt issued by highly rated companies. 
The New York Fed will lend to a ""special purpose vehicle,"" which will then buy bonds and issue loans to companies. At the end of the day, this will provide cheap loans to large and medium-sized companies to help them cover business expenses and stay in operation, said Roberto Perli, head of global policy research for Cornerstone Macro. 
2) Keep loans available for households and businesses.
Through the Term Asset-backed securities Loan Facility (TALF), the Fed is accepting bundled groups of assets secured by auto loans, credit cards, student loans and other types of credit. The program will reduce risks for banks and make it easier for them to keep issuing new loans to consumers and businesses that need them, said Steve Friedman, senior economist for MacKay Shields. 
The TALF will also support certain small business loans that are backed by the Small Business Administration. However, some small businesses may not qualify for loans backed by the SBA, which requires businesses to be a certain size and to be in operation for a minimum amount of time.
3) Main Street lending program. 

The Fed said Monday that it will soon announce the details of a new program that will support loans to small and medium-sized businesses, complementing programs offered by the Small Business Administration. This program, which could be done in conjunction with the Treasury department, may offer more direct help to businesses, but the specifics have yet to be announced.

708,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 23, 2020 05:15PM ET</span>",Some U.S. wealth advisers tell clients to stay put as markets fall,"By David Randall and Beth Pinsker
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The deepest U.S. stock market sell-off since the 2008 financial crisis is prompting some financial advisers to tell wealthy clients to hold steady or even increase their equity exposure if they have at least 10 years until retirement.
Remaining fully invested in stocks despite the volatility and economic shocks from the rapidly spreading coronavirus is easier said than done. Yet financial advisers predict a broad economic recovery without a depression, thanks in part to extraordinary Federal Reserve measures to backstop financial markets.
These advisers said they believe investors with a longer timeline have an opportunity to buy equities at low valuations.
The benchmark S&P 500 trades at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 13.8, about 30% less than when it hit record highs on Feb. 19 and 11% below its long-term average, according to Refinitiv data.
""The reality is that no matter how you think about it, the next five-year return given these valuations is undoubtedly higher than it was two months ago,"" said Joe Duran, chief executive of  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS)'s United Capital division.
Duran is telling clients who feel they have to get out to either sell a small portion of their portfolio and move the cash to a bank account, or sell stocks with deep declines to book losses for tax write-offs.
The argument that stocks will quickly recover rests on assumptions never tested in such extreme conditions.
Markets can fall even further, warned Steve Chiavarone, portfolio manager and equity strategist at Federated Hermes. ""If anybody tells you they're not professionally or personally nervous they're lying."" 
STAYING PUT
Financial adviser Charles Sachs, at Kaufman Rossin Wealth in Miami, does not think the market is near the bottom. Everyone is concerned, but the majority of his wealthy clients are staying put because they expect a quick rebound.
""The problem with a V-shaped recovery is that nobody rings a bell when you're at the bottom of the V,"" Sachs said.
Nick Hofer, a certified financial planner at Boston Family Advisors, said some clients are buying broad-based funds with the periodic cash payments from their private equity and venture capital investments.
""These volatility moves show that the market doesn't know when this is going to end,"" said Hofer.
Some wealthy people have no option but to stay put.
Leon LaBrecque, chief growth officer at Sequoia Financial Group in Troy, Michigan, said almost all of his clients with concentrated stock positions in individual companies inherited them, with a very low basis and would incur huge taxes if they sold. One client inherited stock with a $10,000 basis that is now worth $10 million.
They will be fine ""unless you end up with bankruptcies or a significant protracted recession,"" LaBrecque said, pointing to an L-shaped market curve with an extended bottom.

Investing.com - The broader market was a good barometer today for what investors will be looking for Tuesday.
Any hint of action from the federal government was bullish (although that term is relative given the magnitude of selloffs Wall Street is seeing).
The focus remains on a stimulus package that would see stricken industries helped out and checks mailed to taxpayers.
We’ll also see manufacturing and services economic data and earnings from  Nike  .
Here are three things that could move the markets tomorrow.
1, Congressional Stimulus Package in Focus Again
While another rescue plan from the Federal Reserve to ensure liquidity in the financial markets was initially greeted by equity buying, that enthusiasm faded as the Senate was unable to agree on a stimulus package.
Republicans and Democrats remain at loggerheads about the details of a package of about $2 trillion to help businesses and individuals.
A procedural vote failed again, so the major indexes could be tethered to any headlines out of Capitol Hill tomorrow.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said that further delay could mean a package would be delayed until Friday, according to published reports.
2. March PMIs Arrive
Manufacturing and services activity in Europe and the U.S. highlight the economic calendar for tomorrow.
The eurozone numbers arrive at 9 AM GMT.
The March Markit manufacturing purchasing managers’ index (PMI) is expected to come in at 39, according to economists’ forecasts compiled by Investing.com. The services PMI is also expected to have dropped to 39, while the composite PMI is seen 38.8.
The U.S. numbers are due to be released at 9:45 AM ET (13:45 GMT).
March’s manufacturing PMI is expected to have fallen to 42.8, with the services PMI forecast to come in at 42.
At 10:00 AM ET, February new home sales numbers arrive.Sales of new homes are expected to have dropped 2% in February to an annual rate of 750,000.
3. Nike to Report With Stores Shut
Nike (NYSE:NKE) is still scheduled to report earnings after the market closes tomorrow and could give investors a snapshot of how things are faring in retail and apparel.
The company is expected to report a profit of 61 cents per share, down from 68 cents per share in the year-ago quarter, according to analysts’ forecasts compiled by Investing.com. But sales are seen rising to about $9.9 billion from $9.61 billion.
On March 15, Nike made the decision to close its stores in multiple countries, including the U.S., Canada, Western Europe, Australia and New Zealand.

Investing.com –  The Dow ended above session lows on Monday,  as investors weighed a failed bid from Republicans to advance their coronavirus aid package against bold new stimulus measures from the Federal Reserve at a time when infections continued to mount.
The Dow fell 3.04% to 18,591.93, well above session lows of 18,213.65. The Dow has nearly wiped all of its gains since President Donald Trump was elected. The index stood at 18,332.73 on Trump's election day. The S&P 500 slumped 2.93% and the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.27%.
Investor optimism from a wave of cash from the Federal Reserve was largely cast aside by events on Capitol Hill, with investors growing increasingly frustrated at lawmakers' inability to iron out their differences on a nearly-$2-trillion package to support the economy through the Covid-19 pandemic.
The economic stimulus bill, which requires the backing from both chambers of Congress, failed to gain the 60 votes needed to advance go a formal vote in the Senate. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell reportedly said the procedural delays could push a vote on a stimulus bill out to Friday.  
The lack of progress on the bill comes as the coronavirus continued to spread, with infections reaching nearly 370,000 so far, and deaths topping 16,000 worldwide. But there was a sliver of hope, as Lombardy, Italy, ground zero of the Covid-19 outbreak in the country, has seen a slowdown in cases. 
The number of new cases today in the region slowed to 1,550 from 1,691 on Sunday, said Attilio Fontana, the regional governor of Lombardy, according to media reports.
In the U.S., Covid-19 infections have surged above 42,000, with New York state accounting for the bulk of infections nationwide following a nearly-40% jump since Sunday.
The Fed, meanwhile, continued to provide support, expanding its asset purchases program to prop up credit markets at a time when some corporations in hard-hit sectors like travel and hospitality are at risk of falling into bankruptcy.
Energy stocks paced the decline in the broader market, shrugging off a jump in oil prices.
Boeing (NYSE:BA), however, surged 10% amid hopes the aviation industry may soon receive its bailout package to stem the impact from the coronavirus spread. The aircraft maker also announced it will temporarily suspend production at its Puget Sound area facilities in the wake of the state of emergency in Washington state amid the accelerating spread of the Covid-19 virus in the region."
711,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 23, 2020 03:33PM ET</span>",Big Bailouts Need Fierce Watchdogs,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- The U.S. is about to enact an even larger and more encompassing bailout than the one I helped oversee as the special inspector general of the Troubled Asset Relief Program in 2008. That means Americans will once again have to grapple with the inherent unfairness of letting the government pick winners and losers, along with the potential for fraud and scandal that always accompanies the distribution of so much money in such a short time. 
I’ve been one of many critics of the policy failures of the previous bailout. But let’s not forget that strong and effective oversight was one of the clear successes of the 2008 program — or the painful lessons it taught. 
First, strings must be attached to funds handed out to businesses crippled by the fallout from the coronavirus pandemic, and vigorous independent oversight is necessary to ensure compliance with them. Otherwise there will be no way to achieve the policy goals that the bailout intends to accomplish.
There was a startling absence of any such strictures in 2008-2009. When the Treasury Department provided hundreds of billions of dollars to U.S. banks, it said that doing so would restore lending and provide relief to struggling homeowners. But it then refused entreaties to establish conditions that would assure such a result.
It was only the transparency brought through oversight (including an audit by the special inspector general’s office of the banks’ uses of funds) that made it clear that the banks did just about everything with their bailout money other than increasing lending or helping homeowners. While care must be taken to make sure that any conditions are not so onerous or unrealistic that they defeat the purposes of the bailouts themselves, smart, narrowly tailored requirements will be the difference between failure and success.
Second, although granting a certain amount of discretion to policymakers implementing the bailout is necessary to allow them to adapt to changing circumstances, giving them too wide a lane can lead to poorly thought out decisions. Examples from the financial crisis identified by the special inspector general and the other oversight bodies included backdoor bailouts conducted in secret and otherwise shielded from the taxpayers funding them. One of the worst lapses involved the bailout of American International Group’s Financial Products division, in which the government used taxpayer money to secretly pay off the failing insurance company’s Wall Street counterparties to the tune of tens of billions of dollars for securities worth less than half of what the government paid.
There’s also a danger now of picking bailout recipients based more on their political connections and the power of their lobbyists than the merits of their applications. Without the powerful disinfectant of sunlight provided by robust oversight, there is an intolerable risk that the disease of corruption will spread like the coronavirus itself.
Third, agencies will make significant mistakes as they roll out programs, and tight oversight will be needed to correct course given the reluctance in Washington to admit error. The Treasury’s programs to fulfill TARP’s mandate to help homeowners were an egregious example of how badly awry things can go. As originally implemented, they included policies that condoned predatory actions by the banks’ mortgage-servicing arms that left many homeowners worse off as a result of participating in the programs. Without scathing reports from the oversight bodies and subsequent congressional hearings, those rampant abuses — which Treasury had characterized as successes — would have continued unabated. 
Similar revelations provoked by the oversight bodies helped reshape some poorly designed programs and kill others, avoiding what could have been hundreds of billions of dollars of losses. Without truly independent oversight arms, similar errors with potentially similarly devastating consequences will go unchecked.
Fourth, Congress should create a dedicated inspector general to keep an eye on the various aspects of the bailouts. That’s what it did in the last crisis, recognizing that an overtaxed inspector general already in place couldn’t possibly oversee such a massive bailout effectively. Three agencies were created to oversee the TARP program: The special inspector general, a congressional oversight panel and the Government Accountability Office. 
The special inspector general’s office, an independent agency within the Treasury Department, was both an auditing body and a full-fledged law enforcement agency (think of a mini-FBI for the TARP program). It worked to ferret out and deter those who would seek to criminally profit off of a national crisis, and pushed Treasury to include anti-fraud provisions in its bailout programs to bring criminal efforts to the surface. 
These efforts worked. The combination of robust enforcement and effective tripwires resulted in more than 350 convictions (including bank chief executives and other senior officers), $11 billion recovered, and minuscule losses due to fraud for a program of its size and scope. 
Although fraud and scandal are inevitable in a bailout as sweeping as what is now being contemplated by Congress and the administration of President Donald Trump, it would be malfeasance not to include a robust, dedicated inspector general to limit waste, fraud and abuse and to investigate it when it occurs.
As Congress continues to debate the bailout, it is imperative that the lessons from the recent past be repeated. Strong policy-driven conditions, an independent inspector general with primary jurisdiction (an excellent candidate would be the special inspector general’s office for TARP, which is still in business and has plenty of bandwidth as its original mission wanes), and specified congressional oversight will go a long way toward doing so.

Investing.com – Wall Street resumed selling on Monday after an eagerly awaited coronavirus stimulus package failed to win enough votes in a Senate procedural vote, denting investor hopes the economy is set for a big fiscal boost sooner rather than later.
The Dow fell 3.48%, or 667 points, but had cut losses to below 200 points before the vote. The S&P 500 slipped 3.23% and the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.88%.
The nearly-$2-trillion bill to combat the economic effects of the Covid-19 pandemic, which needs to be backed by both chambers of Congress, failed to secure votes to move forward.
In the run-up to the voting process, markets had cut some losses on reports U.S. lawmakers were making progress on advancing the bill, which includes a range of measures to support the economy, including checks to Americans and support for small as well as big businesses.
The lack of progress on the bill comes as the coronavirus continued to spread, with infections reaching nearly 370,000 so far, with deaths above 16,000 worldwide."

MILAN (Reuters) - The Italian government plans to take control of loss-making carrier Alitalia [CAITLA.UL] in a month or so, creating a new company that will start off with a much smaller fleet, union sources said on Monday. 
According to the sources, the industry ministry told unions on Monday that the new Alitalia would start with 25-30 aircraft, around a quarter of the fleet it was operating before the coronavirus outbreak.
Alitalia and the industry ministry were not immediately available for comment. 
""The government said that 25-30 aircraft would only be the starting point, but we are concerned the fleet will not be expanded once the emergency is over,"" one of the sources told Reuters. 
The government did not spell out what its plan was for Alitalia's workforce, which is currently in excess of 11,000.
A meeting between the industry, transport and labor ministers and the unions is scheduled for March 30, the USB union said in a statement.
""Even if we acknowledge the serious crisis that the country is experiencing, the new Alitalia should be created with the idea of developing it and increasing its flights once the emergency is over,"" the CGIL and FILT unions said in a joint separate statement. 
The two unions said they had asked the government for details about the carrier's business plan, adding it should ""protect jobs"". 
The loss-making airline is currently operating 100 flights a day, a quarter of its normal activity, due to the virus outbreak. 
The government last week approved a decree allowing it to put the airline under state control again after 11 difficult years of private management.
It has earmarked 500 million euros ($537 million) for the whole airline sector in Italy, but government sources said the bulk of the money would go to Alitalia, which is rapidly running out of cash.
Alitalia has been run by state-appointed administrators since May 2017 and was looking for new investors to buy it and restructure its business before the global airline sector was sent into a tailspin by the health emergency.
Even before the coronavirus crisis, it was burning through its cash resources at the pace of about 300 million euros a year, its new temporary administrator Giuseppe Leogrande said in January.

DETROIT (Reuters) - General Motors Co (N:GM) and medical equipment maker Ventec are speeding up efforts under a partnership code-named ""Project V"" to build ventilators at a GM plant in Kokomo, Indiana, to help combat the coronavirus outbreak.
GM said on Monday that work at its Indiana plant, which makes small electronic components for cars, is part of the effort to expand ventilator production. Sources said the GM-Ventec project is known internally as ""Project V."" 
As part of the effort to boost ventilator output from Ventec, GM has arranged for the supply of 95% of the parts needed to build the ventilator and is seeking to source the remaining 37 necessary parts, according to an email to suppliers from Shilpan Amin, GM's vice president of global purchasing.
The goal of the venture is to build up to 200,000 ventilators, said people familiar with the plans who asked not to be identified. 
U.S. President Donald Trump said on Sunday that U.S. automakers GM,  Ford Motor Co  (N:F), and Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) had been given the green light to produce ventilators and other items needed during the coronavirus outbreak. It was not clear what Trump meant by the companies ""being given the go ahead.""
""Ventec Life Systems and General Motors have been working around the clock to implement plans to build more critical care ventilators,"" GM spokesman Dan Flores said in an email on Monday. ""With GM’s support, Ventec is now planning exponentially higher ventilator production as fast as possible.
""As part of those efforts, GM is exploring the feasibility to build ventilators for Ventec at a GM facility in Kokomo, Indiana,"" he added. 
First parts need to be delivered by suppliers to GM by April 6, the sources said. Supplier production could begin ""within the next 2-3 weeks,"" Amin said in his email. It was not clear when GM might begin production. 
""Thank you for being such great partners that share the same passion for supporting the country in our time of need. There is still support needed with a few remaining parts,"" Amin said in the email. 
On Friday, GM and Ventec Life Systems said they were teaming up to increase Ventec's production of desperately needed ventilators. 
“By tapping their expertise, GM is enabling us to get more ventilators to more hospitals much faster,"" Ventec Chief Executive Chris Kiple said on Friday. 

At the time, GM Chief Executive Mary Barra said the automaker would explore other ways to help beyond helping Ventec scale up production.

Investing.com – Wall Street moved off its session lows on Monday, amid growing hopes that U.S. lawmakers are set to back a nearly-$2-trillion stimulus package to combat the Covid-19 pandemic, which has killed more than 15,000 worldwide.
The Dow fell 1.87%, theS&P 500 lost 1.66% and the Nasdaq Composite added 0.1%.
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer reportedly suggested U.S. lawmakers were close to ironing out their differences and agreeing on a stimulus package to support economy.
The vote the package is slated for 1:30 PM ET (17:30 GMT), according to media reports.
The growing hope over the passage of the bill comes a day after Democrats had blocked the bid, claiming that it did more to help big businesses that ordinary Americans.
The demand for fiscal stimulus comes as the Federal Reserve continues to play its role to keep markets running smoothly, with the central bank rolling out a serious of measures to prop up credit markets to keep companies afloat as several states enter lockdown.
The announcement comes just days after the Fed said it would expand its asset purchases program beyond Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities to include municipal bonds to avert a liquidity squeeze."

727,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 23, 2020 12:05PM ET</span>",McConnell Set to Try Again to Force Vote on Virus Stimulus Plan,"(Bloomberg) --
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is poised to try again Monday to advance a $2 trillion stimulus plan after Republicans and Democrats failed to engineer a quick jolt to a sinking economy amid the rising coronavirus death toll, plunging financial markets and dire predictions of a deep recession.
The Senate is scheduled to hold a series of procedural votes aimed at getting the legislation to the floor. But the chamber’s Republican majority can’t do it without the votes of Democrats
Negotiations to break the impasse over the stimulus legislation continued into the night Sunday after Senate Democrats rejected McConnell’s latest version of the plan, which had been the product of frenzied bipartisan negotiations a day earlier.
Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer met several times Sunday night, including at 11:45 p.m., with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who has been conducting what amounted to shuttle diplomacy between the two sides.
While many details of the plan had been hashed out, some fundamental differences hadn’t been bridged. The recriminations began immediately after McConnell’s bid for a procedural vote failed.
An incensed McConnell cited plummeting stock futures to express the urgency to act Monday, and the Kentucky Republican ripped Schumer and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.
“We’re fiddling here. We’re fiddling with the emotions of the American people, fiddling with the markets,” McConnell said on the Senate floor. “This obstruction achieves nothing.”
Schumer complained that McConnell’s bill was partisan. He said it amounts to “a large corporate bailout” with insufficient oversight, and shortchanges the health-care response to the pandemic. He said there should be “much more money” for hospitals for equipment that is rapidly becoming in short supply.
President Donald Trump sounded an optimistic note after the failed vote, saying, “I think we’ll get there.” But there signs that he was growing frustrated with the broader situation in the country. Trump began talking privately late last week about reopening the nation because he’s worried about the economic damage from an extended shutdown, according to people familiar with his thinking.
Senators from each party said Monday they expected a deal. In one potential sign of movement, Senator Chris Coons, a Delaware Democrat, Senators have agreed to provide funding for an an accountability board for the $500 billion bailout fund. That’s a key Democratic demand, but the details had yet to be worked out.
“I don’t see that there is yet final agreement on the language of what is the scope of that accountability board,” he said on Bloomberg Television. Negotiations were ongoing Monday morning, he said.
Financial markets have been roiled by the impact of the pandemic as it forces businesses to shutter and governments to keep people inside. S&P 500 futures dropped 5% at the opening of Asian markets, triggering a trading stop. While they recovered later, they were still down nearly 3.8% as of 3 p.m. in Tokyo.
McConnell at one point threatened to use the market turmoil to force the hand of Democrats, saying he would schedule another procedural vote for 9:45 a.m. Monday, “15 minutes after the markets open, and see if there’s a change of heart.” The Senate later adjourned until noon.
The S&P 500 dropped at the open Monday, and the index has now erased almost all gains accrued during Donald Trump’s presidency.
The prospect of an election-year market meltdown will revive memories for many lawmakers of the standoff over the bank rescue plan amid the 2008 financial crisis.
In September of that year, the House unexpectedly rejected President George W. Bush’s $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Plan to bail out banks in the wake of the subprime mortgage collapse and to restore confidence in credit markets. The defeat was the result of a revolt by rank-and-file Republicans against their own president and it sent the Dow Jones Industrial Average down almost 7 percent.
McConnell and then-Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid worked to usher it through the Senate on a solid 74-25 majority two days later. Then on Oct. 3, the House reversed and narrowly cleared the legislation and sent it to Bush for his signature.
Until Sunday’s procedural vote on the stimulus plan, Republicans insisted that an agreement with Democrats was close to fruition.
To attract Democrats, McConnell had agreed to many of their demands, adding hundreds of billions of dollars in fresh spending, including a $600 per week increase per worker in unemployment benefits, a $75 billion public health package, and tens of billions more for transit, education, nutrition and assorted other programs.
But Democrats, including Schumer and Pelosi, who flew into Washington Saturday, said a $500 billion chunk of the bill that can be used to help corporations, including airlines, gave too much discretion to the Treasury secretary and that it lacked transparency and accountability. They also said the aid for state and local governments and health care providers fell far short of what is needed.
Republicans and Democrats have differed from the start
on how much of the money should go toward traditional aid programs like unemployment insurance, food aid and similar programs.
Many of those differences appeared to be resolved during the day Saturday as four groups of senators worked out differences. But sticking points remained, particularly when it came to final details such as who would oversee the disbursement of the aid for companies and how that would be disclosed. One Democratic aide said the package could theoretically be used to bail out the president’s own company without voters knowing about it for months.
The total package includes about $2 trillion worth of proposals, including $350 billion for small businesses, a $500 billion chunk of the bill that can be used for loans to larger corporations including airlines or state and local governments, extensive corporate tax breaks and tax deferrals, and direct payments of $1,200 for middle-class and low-income Americans.
Pelosi left a meeting in McConnell’s office earlier Sunday saying they had no deal and the House would write its own package -- a move that could add days of partisan wrangling. Pelosi later told House Democrats that the Senate bill was “very different” from the package they were crafting.
House Democrats could release their own proposal as soon as Monday, according to an official familiar with the issue.
Even before the defeat of the Senate’s procedural motion, House Democratic leaders were not planning to call the chamber’s members back to Washington on Monday, or even Tuesday. House Democrats have instead scheduled a caucus-wide telephone call Tuesday afternoon, rather than bringing members back by then, senior Democratic aides said.
A major package remains likely, but it now could take additional time for the two parties to work out their differences, even as the virus continues to ravage not just the nation but Congress itself.
The vote came hours after the first senator, Republican Rand Paul of Kentucky, announced that he had tested positive for the coronavirus, and two other Republicans, Mitt Romney and Mike Lee, said they were self-quarantining because they had been in contact with him. Two House members, Republican Mario Diaz-Balart of Florida and Utah Democrat Ben McAdams, also have tested positive for the virus.

728,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 23, 2020 11:59AM ET</span>",U.S. Stocks Plunge With Stimulus Deal in Limbo: Markets Wrap,"(Bloomberg) -- U.S. stocks sank further as investors awaited progress on a congressional spending package to tackle the fallout from the coronavirus pandemic. Measures of corporate credit risk eased and the dollar fell after the Federal Reserve announced a massive second wave of initiatives to support a shuttered American economy.
The S&P 500 fell as much as 4.9% as lawmakers failed to agree on a stimulus bill over the weekend. Negotiations continued after Democrats blocked the first effort. The index is down almost 35% from its Feb. 19 record and is headed for the lowest close of Donald Trump’s presidency. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped as much as 5%, losing all its gains since he was elected on Nov. 8, 2016.
“Fiscal is far more important than the Fed in stabilizing risk assets,” said Dennis DeBusschere of Evercore ISI. “That being said, as the Fed gets more creative, they can become much more relevant. They are going to buy everything.”
The central bank said it will buy an unlimited amount of bonds to keep borrowing costs low and will set up programs to ensure credit flows to corporations and state and local governments. Spreads on credit default swaps tightened and bond ETFs eligible for Fed purchases rallied.
“The Fed has really rallied to do as much as it can to extend its reach, but I think at the end of the day, the markets recognize this requires a fiscal response,” said Nela Richardson, an investment strategist at Edward Jones. “Every time the Fed takes a strong step forward there’s a kind of, ‘Oh no, this is worse than anyone thought’ reaction in the market.”
The Stoxx Europe 600 fell as the continent’s leaders scrambled to enforce more curbs on people’s movements and Italy began shutting most industrial production. Core European bonds climbed. Equities fell earlier across most of Asia, where India’s benchmark plunged a record 13% while the rupee sank to the lowest ever amid moves to lock down widespread areas of the country. Brent crude extended losses after its 20% decline last week, while West Texas crude fluctuated.
Investors are beginning another dramatic week digesting slashed economic forecasts and news of Europeans struggling to curb the pandemic, with Italy and Spain reporting 2,000 deaths over the weekend between them. Warnings grew that a global recession is coming as cities from New York to Los Angeles all but shut down and cases rise rapidly outside Asia.
Before the Fed news, focus had been on the main American political parties failing to agree on a quick jolt to the sinking economy with a $2 trillion stimulus.  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) warned the epidemic could cause U.S. GDP to shrink a record 30% in the second quarter. Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis President James Bullard said the country’s jobless rate may hit 30% and growth could even halve to $2.5 trillion during the three-month period.
Meanwhile, international air carriers continued to announce drastic measures to cope with the outbreak, with giants Emirates and Singapore Airlines Ltd. among the latest to slash flights, and jet maker Airbus SE withdrawing its earnings guidance.
Elsewhere, New Zealand’s dollar earlier fell with the country’s bond yields after its central bank joined other countries in saying it will start buying bonds to stimulate the economy, though the kiwi recovered after the Fed announcement.

729,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 23, 2020 11:50AM ET</span>",Investor Ackman tweets to Trump: Close down the country,"By Svea Herbst-Bayliss
BOSTON (Reuters) - Billionaire investor William Ackman, who has long worried about risks posed by the coronavirus, called on the Trump administration on Wednesday to seal off the country for 30 days and said stocks would ""soar"" if such restrictions were imposed.
""The only answer is to shut down the country for the next 30 days and close the borders,"" Ackman said in a post on Twitter, adding: ""Tell all Americans that you are putting us on an extended Spring Break at home with family.""
Ackman also said he had bought stock in private equity group Blackstone (NYSE:BX) Group as well as portfolio companies his hedge fund Pershing Square (NYSE:SQ) Capital Management already owns, including Hilton Worldwide Holdings.
Ackman, who has some 58,000 Twitter followers but rarely tweets, took to President Donald Trump's preferred communication platform to publicize his plan for proposed action.
After markets closed with fresh losses and the Dow wiped out the last of its gains put on since Trump was inaugurated, Ackman told Reuters shutting down U.S. borders for 30 days was the only way to limit the virus' spread and save industries on the verge of collapse.
""If President Trump were to go on television, with no one standing next to him, and say that he is shutting everything down and tell people to work from home and stay at home for 30 days, this thing could be killed and markets would soar. It might take some time for markets to recover but I'm confident they would recover fully,"" he said.
Ackman, who normally considers himself an optimist, began worrying about the effects of the virus weeks ago and said he began preparing personally and professionally for a pandemic that he estimated could kill between 1% and 2% of the world's population.
""People need to be scared and take this seriously,"" he said, urging the government to essentially force most Americans to stay home for a month.
Without people wandering around outside, the virus' re-infection rate would be killed, he said, adding ""and then you kill the virus ... 30 days would give us a cushion.""
Ackman protected his portfolio with a hedge that helped turn late February losses into gains in early March. Through March 17, however, the Pershing Square Holdings fund lost ground and is now down 6.5% for the year, data from the hedge fund show.
Ackman broadcast his policy prescription in an emotional interview with CNBC on Wednesday and then again on Twitter.
I am sure ""the president will do the right thing in temporarily shutting down the country and closing the borders. If that happens, we can win the war against the virus,"" Ackman tweeted.
The White House responded by saying that Trump has ensured that all Americans would be taken care of, including affected industries and small businesses, CNBC reported.
Ackman is especially concerned about the hotel, airline, restaurant and auto industries, saying they may not have a long lifeline. 
""Hotels rent rooms for a night and if no one comes, they are done,"" he said. He called Hilton a ""canary in the coal mine,"" and warned that without fast action the hotel industry could tumble to zero.
In addition to buying Blackstone stock, Ackman said he had been loading up on the companies already in his portfolio like Lowe's and Restaurant Brands, as well as Hilton. 
Ackman, who runs $6.5 billion investment firm Pershing Square Capital Management from New York, moved his family, including his father who has battled lung cancer, out of the city several weeks ago.
He said he spends a lot of time thinking about so-called black swan events and began worrying about the coronavirus' potentially catastrophic effects on public health and the economy many weeks ago.

Last year, Ackman's publicly traded hedge fund surged 58%, making it one of the industry's best performers. Earlier this year, he sold off a position in Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) before the coffee chain's stock tumbled some 34% amid warnings for people to avoid restaurants, bars, and coffee shops.

Here are the latest developments:
Plan Could Fund Accountability Panel for Aid (11:20 a.m.)
There is now funding in the stimulus plan to operate an accountability board for the $500 billion bailout fund, Senator Chris Coons, a Delaware Democrat, said on Bloomberg TV Monday.
A demand for greater oversight of the fund to assist companies and state and local governments has been a key sticking point for Democrats. Coons said the details were still being worked out and put into the legislation.“I don’t see that there is yet final agreement on the language of what is the scope of that accountability board,” he said.
Coons said the most recent draft version he saw still granted the Treasury secretary “very broad discretion.” For example, he said, if a company takes a multibillion-dollar loan and simply uses it for bailouts and executive compensation, there is “no clear mechanism” for that to be resolved.
Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren said in a separate Bloomberg Television Interview that she wants an oversight panel with “real teeth” to monitor that the money is spent according to the law and according to the promises that companies made when they took the funds.
Coons, Barrasso Both Say Senate Will Make a Deal (8:02 a.m.)
U.S. senators in both political parties expressed confidence the Senate will approve a broad economic stimulus measure to address the coronavirus crisis later Monday, despite Sunday’s failed procedural vote on a Senate GOP measure that would have begun debate while talks on a bipartisan replacement bill continued.
Speaking in separate TV appearances, Republican Senator John Barrasso of Wyoming and Democratic Senator Chris Coons of Delaware said they expect lawmakers in both parties will resolve differences and advance legislation to the House.
“Relief is on the way,” Barrasso said on Fox Business. “We want to get this passed today.”
Coons said both parties were able to agree easily on major parts of the bill, including $350 billion in aid for smaller businesses. Outstanding disputes, including how many strings should be attached for airlines and other big businesses getting help, can be resolved, he said.
“I think we will get this done,” he said on “Fox and Friends.” He added that “there is a sense of urgency.”
Mnuchin, Schumer Keep Negotiating on Bill (6 a.m.)
Negotiations continued Sunday night between Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer after Democrats blocked the economic stimulus measure in a Senate procedural vote.
McConnell has been aiming for a final Senate vote Monday, but leaders of both parties continue to differ on key sections, including a $500 billion chunk that could be used to help corporations, including airlines, or state and local governments.

Traders of S&P 500 e-minis are now only offering to buy or sell a few contracts at a time -- often numbering in the single digits -- compared with an average of more than 1,000 just a month ago, data from  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) Asset Allocation show.
Drastically thin markets are alarming because they can fuel outsize price swings. With futures markets being halted almost every day in the wake of wild swings, the lack of liquidity is so severe now that it’s fueling concern even among the pros who’ve lived through the worst market crashes in history.
“There’s no liquidity in any market,” said Rick Bensignor, the founder of Bensignor Group and a former strategist for  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), who has traded the futures market for 40 years. “When you’re talking about restructuring a portfolio too, you have to think about the potential slippage that’s involved to get anything done.”
Of course it’s no surprise that markets would thin out when investors, strategists, and economists alike are unsure of the ultimate impact of the coronavirus pandemic. And it’s not clear if the low liquidity may be feeding upon itself -- i.e., are traders staying away because liquidity is so horrible, or is it just a natural side effect caused by all the uncertainty?
“‘Thinly traded’ now an understatement considering how much liquidity in futures market has collapsed,” tweeted Liz Ann Sonders, the chief investment strategist at  Charles Schwab  (NYSE:SCHW).
U.S. contracts hit exchange-mandated halts for the ninth time in 10 days overnight Sunday, before an announcement of unlimited quantitative easing from the Federal Reserve ignited gains that lasted just 20 minutes before turning negative again.
Strategists at JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co. have estimated liquidity in U.S. futures markets is seven times worse than the poorest levels during the financial crisis. According to Bensignor, typically when it comes to size, anywhere from 200 to 500 blocks trade on both the bid and offer side of a wager at every tick. Watching his screen Monday morning, there were fewer than 10.
“You are going to have to deal as you restructure portfolios,” he said in an interview on Bloomberg Television. “You’re also going to have to realize that doing so is going to cost a lot of money compared to what you had to do in the past, where you could basically just do it for no cost because of the liquidity.”

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan will appoint a former Norinchukin Bank executive as the new head of its $1.5 trillion Government Pension Investment Fund (GPIF), a source with direct knowledge of the matter said on Monday.
The appointment of Masataka Miyazono will be announced later this week, said the source, who declined to be identified because the information has not been made public. The GPIF is the world's largest pension fund and is closely watched by global financial markets because of its mammoth size. 
No one was immediately available for comment at the GPIF outside of regular working hours.
Miyazono will replace current president Norihiro Takahashi, whose term is due to expire at the end of march. Miyazono is the head of the Pension Fund Association and previously served as deputy president at agricultural lender Norinchukin Bank.
Norinchukin, which pools the assets of Japanese farmers, is also a big player in global markets.
The GPIF is due to announce a change in its asset allocation later this month. In its current portfolio, the allocation targets are 25% each for domestic and foreign stocks, 35% for domestic bonds, and 15% for foreign bonds.

Investing.com -- U.S. stocks fell again in early trade on Monday, shrugging off the Federal Reserve's latest attempt to calm markets and focusing instead on the rising death toll and disruption to public life across the U.S.
Earlier,  the Federal Reserve said it would increase its asset purchases by any volume necessary and introduced new lending facilities to backstop businesses and consumers. However, that only partly made up for the inability of Congress to agree on a 'phase 3' economic support package. 
“It has become clear that our economy will face severe disruptions,” the Fed said in its statement. “Aggressive efforts must be taken across the public and private sectors to limit the losses to jobs and incomes and to promote a swift recovery once the disruptions abate.”
St. Louis Fed President James Bullard told Bloomberg on Sunday he thought the U.S. economy shrink by half in the second quarter as the virus' impact increases, although he predicted a vigorous rebound thereafter.
By 10:08 AM ET (1408 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average had fallen 260 points or 1.4% to 18,914 points. The S&P 500 also fell 1.4% but the Nasdaq 100 held up better, falling only 0.2%.
The Fed's measures represented a sweeping extension of the backstop for private risk in the U.S. economy. In addition to the promise of unlimited Treasury and agency purchases, it also extended its program to include securities backed by commercial mortgages as well as both the primary and secondary market for corporate bonds, market segments that had shown signs of increasing stress last week as credit spreads blew out. 
Futures on the main indices had turned up sharply before the opening but immediately ran into fresh selling pressure, amid frustration at the failure of Congress to roll out more comprehensive protections for businesses and workers. 
""Other countries have already exceeded our efforts,"" said Grant Thornton chief economist Diane Swonk via Twitter. ""No one will look back at any government and say you did too much. They will say, why didn’t you do more. The politics and how we want to structure our economy can be dealt with later.""
Among individual stocks, General Electric  (NYSE:GE) stock fell 2.3% after CEO Larry Culp said its aviation unit plans to cut its total U.S. workforce by about 10% amid a sudden stop in orders for airliners. In a letter to employees, Culp also said he will forgo his salary for the rest of 2020.
Stocks bucking the negative trend again included Netflix  (NASDAQ:NFLX) and videoconferencing software group  Zoom Video Communications  (NASDAQ:ZM), who continue to ride a wave of bets that they will prosper from the spread of remote working and home confinement. Netflix has confirmed it has had to allow lower-quality streaming in various markets due to the surge in traffic coming to its site as a result of lockdown policies.
However, there were sharp losses in a number of investment funds specializing in less liquid assets. 
Occidental Petroleum  (NYSE:OXY) stock also fell 3.3% amid further weakness in crude oil, despite a Wall Street Journal report saying it's on the verge of striking a peace deal with activist investor Carl Icahn.

GE's aviation unit, which makes engines for  Boeing Co  (N:BA) and Airbus SE (PA:AIR) aircraft, employed about 52,000 people globally as of 2019, with about half of them working in the United States.
Shares of the company fell as much as 3.9% to $6.25 in morning trading, slightly more than the latest round of broad falls on Wall Street in response to the crisis. 
Global airlines are seeking tens of billions dollars in state bail-outs to absorb the shock from the coronavirus crisis, as they ground almost entire fleets and place thousands of workers on unpaid leave to stay afloat.
Delta Air Lines Inc (N:DAL) on Friday said its second-quarter revenue would fall by $10 billion, or 80%, as the virus all but halted global passenger travel.
""What we don't know about the magnitude and duration of this pandemic still outweighs what we do know,"" GE's Culp said in a letter to employees on Monday, adding that he would forgo his salary for the rest of 2020. (https://reut.rs/3aetSlc) 
His total compensation was $24.6 million in 2019. 
The lack of aircraft maintenance activity will also affect about 50% of GE's U.S. maintenance, repair and overhaul workforce for 90 days, Culp said.
The cost reductions will result in 2020 savings of between $500 million and $1 billion for GE, which has already placed a hiring freeze and canceled salaried merit increases for employees.

GE had about 205,000 employees in 2019.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Reserve announced Monday that it was making a tweak to its rules to make sure that banks face gradual restrictions on activities as they dip into one of their capital buffers.
The interim final rule updates rules around banks' ""total loss absorbing capacity"" buffers, which is an extra cushion banks keep on their books to guard against future losses. The change ensures that restrictions on capital payouts by banks are imposed gradually as banks dip further into their buffer, which the Fed said will help ensure banks continue lending.
The move is the latest in a series of numerous changes, clarifications, and easings to rules that regulators have made, in their effort to ensure banks keep lending and do not curtail their efforts to aid struggling borrowers over supervisory concerns.
The announcement follows a Sunday night move by bank regulators, including the Fed, to clarify that bank examiners will not look harshly at bank efforts to modify loans for borrowers struggling amid the pandemic, so long as they are made in a ""safe and sound"" manner. Banks will not be required to categorize such relief as ""troubled debt restructurings,"" which typically require banks to carry more capital to offset the risk.

744,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 23, 2020 09:30AM ET</span>","Already retired, or close to it? How to think about volatility in perilous times","By Mark Miller
CHICAGO (Reuters) - The breathtaking coronavirus-induced plunge of the stock market has unnerved retirement investors of all ages, but it poses special risks for people close to, or already retired. Unlike younger workers with many years ahead of earning and saving, older investors are less able to fall back on income from work and may have less ability to wait out their losses.
How should older investors think about their portfolios now? In one sense, this is the wrong question. A much bigger concern is uncertainty about the resilience of the economy as major sectors grind to a halt as we fight the virus. Still, here are some big-picture thoughts about portfolios from the experts, and some tactical moves to consider.
First, think of the big picture, said Allan Roth, a CFP and head of Wealth Logic in Colorado Springs, Colorado. 
“Markets going down for the last three and a half weeks is statistically rare, but 11 years of a bull market? This is the first time that has happened, so it’s the larger perspective that matters.”
“People are working toward financial independence, and suddenly, the market goes way down in a very fast, shocking manner,” Roth added. “So the natural instinct is not acting out of fear, but to protect what's left - 'I would love to get out of the market now, it would make me feel so much better.' And my logic tells me it's the absolute wrong thing to do.""
And in this moment, it is critical to understand the difference between volatility and risk.
Volatility is what you will always experience from time to time in the stock market. Risk, on the other hand, is about uncertainty, and the fact that we cannot predict the future. And there is risk in any investment.
For example, selling off your portfolio and stuffing your mattress with cash carries the risk that inflation will erode the value of your savings - sharply - over time. If inflation continues at a 2% annual pace, cash will lose half its value over a 25-year period.
REBALANCING
Roth is a big fan of rebalancing your portfolio periodically. This keeps you on track with whatever equity-fixed income allocation you have determined is right for you. But it also can improve returns over time, because it lets you run against the market herd without even thinking about it - when stocks surge, you are selling a bit toward the top of the market; when they drop, you are buying the dip.
Roth calculates that an all-stock portfolio so far this century (through the end of February, using total market index funds, two-thirds U.S. and one-third international) has enjoyed a 4.98% annualized return, while a balanced portfolio (60% stocks, 40% bonds) earned 5.36%.
TARGET ALLOCATIONS 
For retirees, how much of that allocation should go to equities? If you are looking for a proxy on how professional money managers think about that question, look no further than target date funds, which automatically reduce participants’ exposure to stocks as retirement approaches.  Target  (NYSE:TGT) date funds have become dominant favorites in 401(k) plans in recent years, and a growing number of participants are keeping them in retirement, either by staying in their workplace plans or using them in rollover IRAs.
Fidelity Investments' target date series hold 51% equity at the point of retirement - an allocation that the firm decreased by 3.5% two years ago. And last year, it boosted global diversification within the equity portion of its portfolio.
Along with stocks, the funds hold 41% in bonds and 8% in cash equivalents. 
The balance between equities, bonds and cash differs somewhat among the three largest target date fund providers, depending very much on their view of the primary goals for retirees. That reflects a Fidelity view that diversification - including cash - is critical. 
“We think investors at the point of retirement are thinking mainly about the balance of risks that they're likely to experience in the future,” said Andrew Dierdorf, one of Fidelity’s target date fund portfolio managers. “Our goal is to help them maintain their standard of living in retirement.”
That means retired investors will need to achieve returns from equities over the long run, especially since they may well live an additional 20 or 30 years, he notes. But the diminished ability to earn income from work - an income stream that generally behaves like income from bonds would - points to the need for diversification, he adds.
T. Rowe Price has a more aggressive approach. In February, it adjusted the glide path of its retirement funds target date series, with the equities allocation gradually falling to 30% at the end point (30 years after retirement), up from 20% earlier. Investors in this series hold 55% in equities at the initial point of retirement.
The higher equity allocation reflects the saving shortfalls of most investors and rising longevity, notes Wyatt Lee, head of target date strategies for the firm. “We can’t fully invest our way out of a savings problem,” he said. “But by maintaining a reasonable level of growth over the long term, we can continue to help support that income stream - even if it means more short-term volatility.”

745,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 23, 2020 08:55AM ET</span>",PG&E to plead guilty to 84 involuntary manslaughter counts over 2018 wildfire,"By Jonathan Stempel
(Reuters) - Pacific Gas & Electric has agreed to plead guilty to 84 involuntary manslaughter counts in connection with the 2018 Camp Fire, the most destructive wildfire in California's history.
The plea by California's largest utility was announced on Monday by its parent PG&E Corp, three days after the utility accepted tighter oversight and pledged billions of dollars to improve safety and help wildfire victims, under an agreement California Governor Gavin Newsom.
That agreement ended a major roadblock to PG&E's planned emergence from Chapter 11 bankruptcy, as Newsom devotes his attention to the coronavirus outbreak in his state.
Pacific Gas & Electric said it entered its plea through a March 17 agreement with the Butte County District Attorney's office, which would end all state criminal proceedings against the San Francisco-based company related to the Camp Fire.
The fire began on Nov. 8, 2018, and destroyed much of the town of Paradise, which had about 26,000 people, and nearby Concow. More than 18,000 buildings were destroyed. PG&E also pleaded guilty to one count of unlawfully starting a fire.
""We cannot replace all that the fire destroyed, but our hope is that this plea agreement, along with our rebuilding efforts, will help the community move forward from this tragic incident,"" PG&E Chief Executive Bill Johnson said in a statement.
Under the agreement, PG&E would pay a maximum $3.5 million fine plus $500,000 in costs, and up to $15 million to provide water to residents after the fire destroyed the utility's Miocene Canal.
Some fire victims would receive payouts under PG&E's proposed bankruptcy reorganization plan, which was submitted on March 16, PG&E said.
The settlement requires approval by the Butte County Superior Court, and by the federal bankruptcy court overseeing PG&E's Chapter 11 case.
PG&E and its utility unit filed for bankruptcy in January 2019, citing more than $30 billion in potential liabilities from California wildfires in 2017 and 2018 linked to its equipment.
The company previously reached $25.5 billion of settlements related to wildfires in 2015, 2017 and 2018, including $13.5 billion for victims and $12 billion for insurers, cities, counties and other public entities.
Under the settlement with Newsom, PG&E agreed to pay no shareholder dividends for three years, saving about $4 billion, and pursue a ""rate-neutral"" $7.5 billion financing package that would benefit ratepayers.
PG&E also agreed to put itself up for sale if it cannot emerge from Chapter 11 by a state-imposed June 30 deadline, before the next wildfire season begins.

The Chartered Governance Institute has published guidance on annual meetings during the epidemic, drawn up in conjunction with the Financial Reporting Council, which regulates auditors and corporate governance codes, and law firm Slaughter & May.
Virtual-only meetings are not viable given they may not constitute valid meetings, but the articles of some companies allow them to hold hybrid meetings, meaning a combination of physical and electronic, the guidance said.
""If a company has already issued its AGM notice for a physical-only meeting but its articles allow a hybrid AGM, it can change to a hybrid AGM,"" the guidance said.

HONG KONG/ZURICH (Reuters) - Global wealth managers are cutting some credit they extend to rich clients as a worldwide markets rout triggers margin calls, even as others see opportunities to help entrepreneurs plug liquidity gaps, people with knowledge of the matter said.
Private banks including  Credit Suisse  Group AG (S:CSGN),  Julius Baer  Gruppe AG (S:BAER), and UBS Group AG (S:UBSG) use lending as a key part of their business to grow their assets and lock in clients.
Wealth managers profit from the interest they charge on so-called Lombard loans - credit secured against a basket of securities as collateral - as well as fees from the increase in assets under management generated via credit.
But wild swings in markets have triggered margin calls on money loaned to clients to buy stocks and other assets.
""There is almost no new conversation happening with clients on loans and it's unlikely to change any time soon. Clients are also very wary about leverage in this market,"" said a senior Greater China wealth manager at a leading Swiss private bank.
Bankers from three Swiss wealth managers in Asia, which has the highest numbers of billionaires globally, said they asked some clients in the last couple of weeks to raise collateral against their loans amid a panic selling in securities.
""Margin calls have been triggered across the street, and the tight liquidity condition is making it tougher for them to even liquidate fixed-income portfolio,"" said another Hong Kong wealth manager, adding some clients are selling gold to raise cash.
Income generated from lending accounted for a third of the total operating revenues of global wealth managers in 2019, and was the second biggest sales contributor after investment management fees, according to consultant Tricumen.
Asia, with 754 billionaires holding $2.5 trillion of assets, is a big market.
Some wealth managers in Asia have cut loan-to-value ratios to 40-50% now compared to 60-70% earlier, said three bankers, who declined to be named as they were not authorized to speak to the media.
LIQUIDITY PLUGS AND MARGIN CALLS
Some banks are also seeing increased demand for leverage to manage cash flow and liquidity needs, as wealthy entrepreneurs and private clients struggle to keep businesses afloat amidst unprecedented global lockdown.
""Smaller entrepreneurs are turning to private banks to help them manage their cash flows,"" a Zurich-based banker at a leading global wealth manager said.
One entrepreneur, for example, had pledged shares in his company in order to inject cash into his business and be able to continue paying staff without lay-offs, the banker said.
""We need that today, because whatever aid is coming around the crisis, there are people who want to bridge that now.""
UBS has seen relatively low losses in its lending portfolio and feels comfortable with its liquidity despite market drops amidst the coronavirus pandemic, Chief Financial Officer Kirt Gardner said on Wednesday.
Credit Suisse commission and fees from lending business grew 5% in 2018, the strongest growth among its business lines. UBS loans to customers in the wealth management business at the end of December rose to $175 billion from $170 billion at end-2018.
Lombard loans at Julius Baer also rose 10% last year to $41 billion.
Credit Suisse said on Thursday business in the first quarter had been going well so far and that it was monitoring its credit exposures prudently, with CFO David Mathers noting the group had not seen material losses on share-backed lending.
When contacted by Reuters, spokespersons at Credit Suisse and UBS referred to their chief financial officers' comment last week. Julius Baer declined to comment.
Wealth managers mainly focused on Europe for their assets, are, however, expected to be impacted more due to the region's negative interest rates coupled with the recent market rout.
""Banks here that are extremely focused on European markets and also Switzerland, when we get a credit squeeze here, then these banks will be much more impacted, because they're not so diversified,"" said another senior wealth manager in Zurich.
""But definitely, all the banks will be impacted from this credit crunch and liquidity constraints and margin calls.""

The dollar fluctuated and European stocks fell.
S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures had earlier dropped to their daily limits, but they gradually recovered before the Fed news helped them erase all their losses. The central bank said it will buy an unlimited amount of bonds to keep borrowing costs low and set up programs to ensure credit flows to corporations and state and local governments. Bloomberg’s dollar index swung from a loss to a gain and back.
The Stoxx Europe 600 declined as the continent’s leaders scrambled to enforce more curbs on people’s movements and Italy began shutting most industrial production. Core European bonds climbed. Equities fell across most of Asia, where India’s benchmark plunged a record 13% while the rupee sank to the lowest ever amid moves to lock down widespread areas of the country. Brent crude extended losses after its 20% decline last week.
Investors are beginning another dramatic week, digesting slashed economic forecasts and the struggles of European countries to curb the pandemic, with 2,000 deaths over the weekend in Italy and Spain alone. Warnings about the pandemic crippling the world’s biggest economy and triggering a global recession are growing as cities from New York to Los Angeles all but shut down and cases rise rapidly.
“As difficult as it is to sit in cash, that’s certainly what I’m doing,” Brian Quartarolo, portfolio manager at Pilgrim Partners Asia, told Bloomberg TV. “I’m presently in New York, and the fear is palpable -- it’s rising and there doesn’t seem to be anyone who thinks that this virus effect is anywhere near peaking yet, particularly here in the States.”
The main American political parties failed to agree on a quick jolt to the sinking economy with a $2 trillion stimulus.  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) warned the epidemic could cause GDP to shrink a record 30% in the second quarter. Federal Bank of St. Louis President James Bullard said the jobless rate may hit 30% and growth could even halve to $2.5 trillion during the three-month period.
Meanwhile, international air carriers continued to announce drastic measures to cope with the outbreak, with giants Emirates and Singapore Airlines Ltd. (SI:SIAL) among the latest to slash flights, and jet maker Airbus SE (PA:AIR) withdrawing its earnings guidance.

Shares in Sweden's oldest retail bank lost a third of their value last year after the emergence of money-laundering breaches that prompted the dismissal of Bonnesen and much of the board.
After Sweden's financial watchdog last week fined the bank a record 4 billion crowns ($385 million) over the breaches, Swedbank said on Monday that it will not dispute the fine. 
""Given the information in the investigations conducted by the Swedish and Estonian financial supervisory authorities and ... law firm Clifford Chance, the board of Swedbank has decided to unilaterally cancel the agreement of severance pay to the bank's previous CEO Birgitte Bonnesen,"" it said.
Bonnesen's lawyer declined to offer immediate comment in response to Swedbank's statement.
Swedbank Chairman Goran Persson said the fine would not affect the bank's ability to pay its proposed shareholder payout for 2019, amounting to 8.80 Swedish crowns per share.
""The sanction that the FSA has delivered, and which the bank's board has accepted, is not going to affect our ability to pay a dividend,"" Persson told a news conference, adding that the bank's annual general meeting will be postponed because of the coronavirus crisis.
Swedbank last week said that it was monitoring the situation would evaluate the effects of the virus before taking a final decision on the dividend.
Persson also said the bank remained committed to the Baltic countries despite the breaches reported from the bank's operations there.
Swedbank's subsidiaries in Estonia and Latvia actively pursued high-risk customers, some of whom had been rejected by another bank, the Clifford Chance report also said.
""Clifford Chance's report confirms the bank's failure. In its anti-money laundering work, the bank has not measured up to the requirements that customers, owners and society are entitled to set,"" Persson said.
In January 2019 Bonnesen denied that the bank was involved in the money-laundering scandal emerging in the Baltic region and which also engulfed Danish rival  Danske Bank  (CO:DANSKE). However, was ousted in March, only an hour before Swedbank's annual meeting, as investors lost faith in her handling of the crisis.
Swedish media have reported Bonnesen's severance pay to be about 20 million crowns ($1.9 million). Swedbank did not immediately respond to a request to confirm the sums involved. 
Bonnesen, who served as CEO for almost three years, headed-up the bank's Baltic business between 2011 and 2014.

MUMBAI/NEW DELHI (Reuters) - The Indian government has asked all state-owned lenders to extend emergency credit lines to corporate borrowers, three government and banking sources said, as it rushes to tackle the fallout from the coronavirus outbreak that has grounded business across the globe.
Banks have been asked to make available an additional 10% in funds over and above sanctioned working capital loans, but not exceeding 2 billion rupees ($26.33 million) per loan account as part of the emergency measures, a senior government official, who did not want to be named, said. 
India's largest lender,  State Bank of India  (NS:SBI), has already rolled out this emergency credit line and the other state-owned lenders are also expected to follow suit shortly, industry officials said.
None of the sources wanted to be named as the plan is not yet public. 
The Finance Ministry and SBI did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The coronavirus pandemic has sparked concerns about the health of the small and medium-sized enterprises that have already been hammered by a slowing economy. 
India's economy expanded at its slowest pace in more than six years in the last three months of 2019 and analysts have predicted a further deceleration caused by the global COVID-19 outbreak. 
Small businesses have been approaching banks to provide additional liquidity support, also warning that loan repayments may be delayed. 
Bankers say that they have received such requests from small and medium-sized businesses in the auto, transportation, trading, hospitality and the aviation sector. 
Lenders have also asked the banking regulator to ease bad loan classification rules and also to extend loan repayments by six months across categories spanning industry, agriculture and retail customers.
Similar requests have also been made to the government and the Reserve Bank of India by the shadow banks that have already begun to see an impact on repayment caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, said sources. 
The RBI has also allowed banks to classify loans to NBFCs for key areas such as agriculture, housing and small and medium businesses - up to certain limits - as priority sector lending for the next financial year as well, in a bid to keep credit flowing to the parts of the economy where most Indians work. 
The measure, introduced in August, was originally planned to last until March this year.
India has more than 400 confirmed cases of coronavirus. Maharashtra, the financial capital of India has recorded the highest number of cases in the country and authorities have banned gatherings of more than five people in the state.

(Reuters) - Wall Street's slide deepened on Monday as the rapidly spreading coronavirus forced more U.S. states into lockdown, overshadowing unprecedented moves by the U.S. Federal Reserve to shore up credit across the economy.
After recently cutting interest rates to near zero, the Fed will now lend against student loans and credit card loans, as well as back the purchase of corporate bonds and make direct loans to companies.
Announcement of the extraordinary measures briefly lifted U.S. stock index futures before Monday's trading session began, but the mounting death toll from COVID-19 and a tide of lockdowns more U.S. states quickly sent the main indexes into the red, putting the S&P 500 (SPX) on pace for its worst month since World War Two.
""What the Fed did is important because it does help in the credit markets. But it's not enough from an equity market perspective,"" said Willie Delwiche, investment strategist at Robert W. Baird in Milwaukee. ""What we now need is leadership out of Congress to pass some sort of stimulus bill, because what the Fed's doing is relieving some problems, but it doesn't do enough to solve to solve what's out there.""
Investors had hoped the U.S. Senate would clear a $1 trillion-plus coronavirus stimulus package over the weekend, but Democrats and Republicans were still scrambling to come to an agreement.
Maryland, Ohio, Louisiana and Delaware joined New York and California in asking people to stay home, foreshadowing a near halt in economic activity and more pain for U.S. equities, and prompting several analysts to slash their growth forecasts.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) expects an outright contraction in global real gross domestic product in 2020 on the back of a 24% plunge in U.S. real GDP in the second quarter: two-and-a-half times as large as the previous post-war record.
The S&P 500 has experienced a $9 trillion wipeout to its value since the benchmark index hit a record high last month. A rush for safe-haven assets like government bonds caused U.S. Treasury yields to fall on Monday.
The S&P 500 is down about 34% from its February record high, its lowest level since fears of the coronavirus swept across Wall Street.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) dropped 3.12% to end at 18,576.04 points, while the S&P 500 (SPX) lost 2.96% to 2,236.7. The Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) dropped 0.27% to 6,860.67, its overall decline cushioned by a 3.07% rise in Amazon.com (O:AMZN). 
""What we really need to turn things around is a sense of closure - not on the virus, but on the response to the virus,"" said Stephen Massocca, senior vice president at Wedbush Securities in San Francisco. ""Once the market sees that, I think the market will rebound considerably.""
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 3.18-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.62-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

The S&P 500 posted no new 52-week highs and 224 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded two new highs and 525 new lows.

Investing.com - European stock markets traded sharply lower Monday, with investors worried about the extent of support from policymakers to combat the economic damage from the coronavirus. 
At 03:35 ET (0835 GMT), the U.K.'s FTSE index was trading 4.5% lower, France's CAC 40 was down 4%, while the DAX dropped 4.5%. The broader based Stoxx 600 Europe index dropped 4.5%. 
The coronavirus crisis could cost the German economy as much as 729 billion euros in 2020, the Ifo economic institute said on Monday.
""The costs will probably exceed everything known from economic crises or natural disasters in Germany in recent decades,"" Ifo President Clemens Fuest said in a statement.
The statement comes after Germany imposed a two-week nationwide ban on all non-essential business and social meetings.  At the same time, U.S. politicians failed to agree on the terms of a funding package of more than $1 trillion, resulting in it not getting enough votes in a key Senate procedural vote late Sunday.
All the while, the number of confirmed cases of the Covid-19 virus continues to rise. Globally, there are now over 341,000 confirmed cases, more than doubling in the last week, and approaching 15,000 deaths.
Trillions of dollars of support have been injected into markets and the broader economy in the last week or so, but investors are still looking to policymakers for more in the coming days with companies losing customers and workers being thrown out of jobs.

However, the PMI data coming out later this week in the U.S., U.K. as well as the euro zone will be of interest as they are likely to provide the most comprehensive overview so far of the coronavirus impact.

757,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 23, 2020 04:25AM ET</span>","Home work triggers demand jump for chips, laptops and network goods","By Heekyong Yang and Makiko Yamazaki
SEOUL/TOKYO (Reuters) - With more employees working from home to help slow the spread of the coronavirus, demand is surging for laptops and network peripherals as well as components along the supply chain such as chips, as companies rush to build virtual offices.
Many firms have withdrawn earnings forecasts, anticipating a drop in consumer demand and economic slump, but performance at electronics retailers and chipmakers is hinting at benefits from the shift in work culture.
Over the past month, governments and companies globally have been advising people to stay safe indoors. Over roughly the same period, South Korea - home of the world's biggest memory chip maker,  Samsung Electronics Co Ltd  (KS:005930) - on Monday reported a 20% jump in semiconductor exports.
Pointing to further demand, nearly one in three Americans have been ordered to stay home, while Italy - where deaths have hit 5,476 - has banned internal travel. Worldwide, the flu-like virus has infected over 300,000 people and led to almost 15,000 deaths since China first reported the outbreak in December.
""With more people working and learning from home during the outbreak, there has been rising demand for internet services ... meaning data centers need bigger pipes to carry the traffic,"" said analyst Park Sung-soon at Cape Investment & Securities.
A South Korean trade ministry official told Reuters that cloud computing has boosted sales of server chips, ""while an increase in telecommuting in the United States and China has also been a main driver of huge server demand.""
In Japan, laptop maker Dynabook reported brisk demand which it partly attributed to companies encouraging teleworking. Rival NEC Corp (T:6701) said it has responded to demand with telework-friendly features such as more powerful embedded speakers.
Australian electronics retailer JB Hifi Ltd (AX:JBH) also said it saw demand ""acceleration"" in recent weeks from both commercial and retail customers for ""essential products they need to respond to and prepare"" for the virus, such as devices that support remote working as well as home appliances. 
CHINA LEAD
China is leading chip demand, analysts said, as cloud service providers such as  Alibaba  Group Holding Ltd (N:BABA), Tencent Holdings Ltd (HK:0700) and Baidu Inc (O:BIDU) quickly responded to the government's effort to contain the virus.
""Cloud companies opened their platforms, allowing new and existing customers to use more resources for free to help maintain operations,"" said analyst Yih Khai Wong at Canalys.
""This set the precedent for technology companies around the world that offer cloud-based services in their response to helping organizations affected by coronavirus.""
China's cloud infrastructure build-up has helped push up chip prices, with spot prices of DRAM chips rising more than 6% since Feb. 20, showed data from price tracker DRAMeXchange.
UBS last week forecast average contract prices of DRAM chips to rise as much as 10% in the second quarter from the first, led by a more than 20% jump in server chips.
It said it expects DRAM chips to be modestly under supplied until the third quarter of 2021, with demand from server customers rising 31% both in 2020 and 2021.
SUPPLY DISRUPTION
Concerns over supply disruption has also contributed to a price rise.
""You've got lots of OEMs and systems integrators in the global market who have intense demand for memory now,"" said Andrew Perlmutter, chief strategy officer at ITRenew, a company that buys and reworks used data center equipment for resale.
""Nobody is shutting down their factories - it is still production as normal - but people worry about memory supply in particular, so they want to get out ahead of production.""
About 69% of electronics manufacturers have flagged possible supplier delays averaging three weeks, showed a poll on March 13 by industry trade group IPC International.

Half of those polled expected business to normalize by July, and nearly three-quarters pointed to at least October.

LONDON (Reuters) - British companies on Monday rushed to heed unprecedented calls by regulators to mothball their results in the face of the escalating coronavirus.
Britain's Financial Conduct Authority said on Saturday that listed companies planning to report over the next few days should hold off for two weeks to better assess how the pandemic is affecting their business.
The move, the first time UK Plc has ever been asked to suspend results en masse, follows similar actions in countries including Spain and China and comes as firms grapple with just how deep an expected global recession is likely to be.
British companies to respond to the FCA's call early on Monday included home improvement group  Kingfisher  (L:KGF) which said it would delay full-year results for at least two weeks.
Kingfisher said it had received a letter from the FCA on Sunday requesting a delay to the results announcement, which had been due on Tuesday. The company said it would provide further updates ""as soon as we are advised by the FCA"".
Drinks maker A.G. Barr (L:BAG), outsourcer  Mears Group  (L:MERG), financial services company STM Group (L:STMG) and energy engineering company Lamprell (L:LAM) also said they were suspending results.
At least 50 companies were expected to report in the week to March 27, data from Refinitiv showed.
The Financial Reporting Council (FRC), which polices accountants that check the books of listed companies in Britain, said on Monday it backed the FCA's decision and that auditors could broaden their approach to delays in company financial statements as the situation ""rapidly"" evolves.
""It is important that due consideration is given by companies to these events in preparing all reporting,"" the FRC said.
""The FRC therefore encourages listed companies and their auditors to consider carefully whether they should delay other corporate reports for the next two weeks, such as interim financial statements and final audited financial statements, except where necessary to meet a legal or regulatory requirement,"" the watchdog said in a statement.
The FCA, FRC and the Bank of England's  Prudential  (LON:PRU) Regulation Authority are expected to come out with a further package of measures, perhaps as soon as this week.
PwC and KPMG, two of the world's ""Big Four"" auditing firms, welcomed the delay.
""It is clear that given the pressures on people and the changes that we see day to day, it is in the public interest for reporting to be delayed to give companies the time to properly consider the impacts on their results,"" said Jon Holt, head of audit at KPMG UK.

EDF said disruption to production caused by employees having to stay away from worksites meant EDF would be lowering its previous 2020 target of 375-390 terawatt hours (TWh) of nuclear production in France. It added that it was keeping its 2020 target for core earnings of 17.5-18 billion euros ($18.7-$19.3 billion), although this was expected to come in at the lower end of that range.

Travel and leisure (SXTP), mining (SXPP) and industrials (SXNP) stocks again led declines on the main index as the relentless spread of COVID-19 brought economic activity to a grinding halt, foreshadowing a deep and lasting global recession.

The company, which recently replaced Boeing (N:BA) as the world's top planemaker, has lost more than half its value since February as measures to contain the outbreak brought global travel to a virtual standstill. Boeing, by contrast, is down more than 70%.

French energy group  Total  (PA:TOTF) fell 3.2% after announcing plans to step up cost cuts and suspend its share buyback program in order to deal with a slump in oil prices.

China’s ambassador to the U.S. reaffirmed his opposition to promoting theories that the virus that causes Covid-19 originated in an American military lab, in an unusual break with the country’s foreign ministry.
Chinese Ambassador Cui Tiankai said in an interview with “Axios on HBO” that he stood by his Feb. 9 statement that it would be “crazy” to spread such theories. Since his original remarks, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Beijing has repeatedly posted statements speculating about a possible U.S. origin for the virus, which was first detected in the central Chinese city of Wuhan.
Cui’s comments represent a sharp public rebuke to Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian, who has publicly questioned whether the virus originated in China and even touted the idea that it may have been introduced by U.S. Army athletes.

The new restrictions also mandate that any concentration of people outside their home must be limited to workers providing essential services. And sick individuals must not leave their homes except to receive medical care.
“I need every New Yorker to understand how serious the situation is right now,” de Blasio said. “We have to change the way we live if we’re going to bend the curve of this epidemic.”

Senate Unable to Advance Aid Measure (6:45 a.m. HK)

Trump to Sign Emergency Declarations (6:10 a.m. HK)
President Donald Trump said he will issue disaster declarations for California, Washington and New York -- the three states hardest-hit by the pandemic. The action lets the states deploy the National Guard to respond to the crisis.
As part of the response, the U.S. Navy hospital ship Mercy is heading to Los Angeles to provide more beds to help reduce pressure on the city’s hospital system now treating Covid-19 cases. The ship should arrive in the city within a week, officials said.
The Navy’s hospital ship Comfort, which is undergoing maintenance, will be dispatched to New York City within the next three weeks to help ease pressures on the hospitals, Trump said.
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers also will build medical stations with 1,000 beds in New York, 1,000 in Washington state and 2,000 in California, Trump said.
Three states account for more than half of the nation’s cases.

Two other Republicans, Senator Cory Gardner of Colorado and Senator Rick Scott of Florida, have also been in self-quarantine in response to possible exposure to the virus from other infected individuals.
Paul, who voted against two emergency coronavirus spending bills this month, tested positive for the virus and is in quarantine, according to a post on his Twitter account on Sunday.

773,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 23, 2020 02:12AM ET</span>",SoftBank Soars After Unveiling $41 Billion Plan to Slash Debt,"(Bloomberg) -- SoftBank Group Corp. unveiled a plan to raise as much as 4.5 trillion yen ($41 billion) to replenish its coffers and slash debt over the coming year, moving to address investors’ concerns about its exposure to money-losing businesses during the coronavirus pandemic. Its shares surged.
The Japanese investment giant said it’s authorized the sale or monetization over the next four quarters of its assets, which include major holdings in corporations from China’s  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd. to sharing-economy stalwarts such as Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc. Billionaire Masayoshi Son’s company also said it was establishing a new share buyback program of as much as 2 trillion yen, on top of a previously announced program to repurchase 500 billion yen of stock.
Shares in the company soared as much as 18.6%, its most intraday since November 2008. Son is struggling to reassure investors about the stability of his empire amid fallout from the coronavirus. Its impact has hammered SoftBank portfolio companies like Uber and WeWork. The rout spread to credit markets and sparked a surge in the cost of insuring debt against default, including that of SoftBank, whose credit-default swaps touched their highest level in about a decade.
Alibaba’s stock was down more than 5% in the afternoon in Hong Kong. SoftBank spokeswoman Hiroe Kotera declined to comment on whether it would sell shares in the Chinese e-commerce giant.
S&P Global Ratings has cut its outlook on SoftBank to negative, citing the broad market declines and the conglomerate’s plans for a share buyback. SoftBank has said its financial policy is to have enough liquidity on hand to cover two years of bond repayments and focus on its loan-to-value ratio, a metric for balancing net interest-bearing debt against the value of investments. SoftBank has also said it’s curbing new investments to match the current environment and acknowledged that fundraising costs are likely to rise.
The new stock repurchase program comes on top of a 500 billion yen plan announced just over a week ago, after activist shareholder Elliott Management Corp. called on the Japanese investment firm to boost returns.

774,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 23, 2020 02:01AM ET</span>","Airbus signs credit facility for 15 billion euros, withdraws 2020 guidance","PARIS (Reuters) - Planemaker Airbus (PA:AIR) announced new steps on Monday to bolster its financial position as a coronavirus pandemic cripples the travel industry, including the signing of a credit facility for 15 billion euros ($16.1 billion).
The European planemaker added it was withdrawing its 2020 financial guidance, dropping a proposed 2019 dividend that had a cash value of 1.4 billion euros and suspending funding to top up staff pension schemes.
""We have withdrawn our 2020 guidance due to the volatility of the situation,"" Chief Executive Guillaume Faury said in a statement.
""At the same time, we are committed to securing the liquidity of the company at all times through a prudent balance sheet policy. I am convinced that Airbus and the broader aerospace sector will overcome this critical period.""
Airbus said it had enough liquidity to cope with any further cash requirements related to the coronavirus, adding that it had around 30 billion euros worth of available liquidity.
Its U.S. rival Boeing (N:BA) is also under similar pressures, and earlier this month Boeing called for a $60 billion lifeline for the U.S. aerospace manufacturing industry.
Over the weekend, Airbus said it would resume only partial aircraft production when its French and Spanish factories reopen on Monday after a four-day shutdown to tackle health concerns over the coronavirus.

775,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 23, 2020 01:15AM ET</span>",Coronavirus fears spark surge in a volatility index,"By Saqib Iqbal Ahmed
NEW YORK (Reuters) - A product that traders use to profit from surges in volatility has soared as coronavirus fears ravaged stocks, prompting concern about a plunge if the market's wild swings subside. 
The VelocityShares Daily 2x VIX Short-Term ETN (O:TVIX) started the year at just short of $49 a share and shot as high as $1,000 a share as markets plunged and volatility exploded. The exchange-traded product (ETP), issued by  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN), last traded at $607.56. 
TVIX trades like a stock and is tied to the movements of derivatives linked to the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX), known as Wall Street's ""fear gauge"" because it tends to rise when the market falls. 
Traders looking to counterbalance stock declines have piled in, ballooning the fund's assets to $6 billion from just over $700 million at the start of 2020 - a reflection of how expectations of volatility shot higher as coronavirus fears began roiling a placid stock market last month. 
(Graphic: TVIX - Assets under management - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/3773/3734/Pasted%20Image.jpg)
But with the VIX near its highest level since the financial crisis, an abrupt drop in volatility could be costly for investors, especially those purchasing the product near recent levels. 
""If you haven't ever implemented volatility instruments in your portfolio, it's best to avoid them. It's a land of wolves right now,"" said Steven Place, founder of InvestingWithOptions in Destin, Florida.
The fund's prospectus warns that a drop in its calculated value to or below 20% that of the prior day's could trigger a liquidation of the note.
The drop in volatility needed to trigger that sort of move would have to be substantial - on par with the sudden decline that occurred after volatility shot higher in the October 1987 Black Monday stock market crash only to subside shortly after, said Vance Harwood, who runs the investment website Six Figure Investing and is a consultant focused on volatility-linked products.
While such a sudden drop may be unlikely, massive shifts in volatility have claimed other popular products linked to the VIX in recent years. 
A Credit Suisse product for investors looking to benefit from continued low volatility met a spectacular demise in 2018, when a sharp market decline caused the VIX to spike. The fund, which was known as XIV, was one of the casualties in the ""short-vol"" trade investors had piled into to profit from stable markets.
Even a relatively moderate fall in volatility could lead to deep losses for TVIX investors that had bought near the highs. On Friday, the TVIX shares traded as high as $685 and as low as $440.
Meanwhile, a continued rise in volatility would force Credit Suisse or its affiliates to buy increasing amounts of derivatives to adjust the fund's exposure to rising volatility. That could, in theory, exacerbate an upward move in the VIX if the purchases were far in excess of the fund's trading volume, investors said. 
""TVIX has become large enough where it can directly affect the market to the point where it can be a positive feedback loop,"" Place said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Walmart Inc (N:WMT) said on Monday it has temporarily raised entry wages for workers in its e-commerce warehouses by $2, following similar moves by rivals, as it attempts to manage a shopping surge brought about by the coronavirus outbreak.
Walmart said the hike will increase entry wages for workers in e-commerce fulfillment centers or warehouses to between $15 and $19 an hour effective immediately through Memorial Day, a holiday in the United States that falls on May 25 this year.
The world's largest retailer, which employs 1.5 million people in the United States, has struggled to keep store shelves stocked and fulfill online orders amid panic-buying by shoppers spooked by the outbreak.
The virus has infected over 32,000 people in the United States leading to more than 415 deaths, showed a Reuters tally.
Last week, Walmart said it would pay special cash bonuses totaling $550 million to hourly staff and hire 150,000 temporary workers through the end of May in its stores and fulfillment centers.
Workers in distribution centers, which primarily help stock stores, start at $17 to $18 an hour. The starting wage for store workers in most locations remains $11 an hour, with the average wage among full-time hourly workers at $14.26.
Rivals such as Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) and  Target  Corp (N:TGT) have also boosted pay and gone on a hiring spree to manage a surge in orders while many clothing and mall-based retailers have been forced to shut stores.
Amazon hiked entry wages to $17 from $15 and announced plans to hire 100,000 warehouse and delivery workers in the United States. On Saturday, it said it would raise overtime pay for associates working in its U.S. warehouses.
Target said last week it would raise its minimum wage by $2 an hour for store and distribution center workers through May 2.
Walmart officials said on Thursday they had reached out to industry groups representing hotels and restaurants, offering to hire staff who have recently lost their jobs due to the virus-induced slowdown in tourism and catering.
On Monday, the company said new employees can begin work at its facilities in as little as 24 hours after being hired. It is also offering new hires and current workers a $250 cash bonus for each new hire referral after 90 days from the new hire's start.

On Sunday, the retailer said it has set up federal drive-through coronavirus testing sites in the parking lots of two stores in Illinois.

Investing.com - Asian markets took sharp tumbles across the board Monday morning as the number of COVID-19 cases rose sharply around the world over the weekend. 
Globally, there are now 294,110 confirmed cases and 12,944 deaths as of March 22 according to the World Health Organisation. 
The S&P/ASX 200 led losses with a tumble of 7.34% by 10:25 PM ET (2:25 AM GMT). 
China’s Shanghai Composite lost 2.84% while the Shenzhen Component was down by 2.82%. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index was down by 4.99%. 
Elsewhere, South Korea’s KOSPI is down by 5.30%. 
Japan’s Nikkei 225 was the sole bright spot as it gained 0.22% after coming back from Friday’s national holiday. 
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) strategists Kamakshya Trivedi and Zach Pandl warned in a Sunday note that markets are “pricing a global recession, which we expect; stay defensive.” 
“The uncertainties around the depth and duration of the hit to the global economy remain high and the momentum in our own, and other, economic forecasts continues to be sharply negative with downside risks,” they added. 
Adding to this uncertainty, in the U.S. Democrats blocked an aid package that could top $1 trillion as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the measure fell short of her goals. 
Constance Hunter, chief economist at KPMG, told Bloomberg: “What we were hoping would be a U-shape, we are starting to fear could be an L-shape.” 
She added that the range of dispersions in forecasts for the economic impact “does illustrate how unprecedented this situation is - it’s a health crisis that’s started morphing into a financial crisis.” "

780,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 22, 2020 09:55PM ET</span>",Australia regulator says banks must provision for virus loan holiday,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's banking watchdog on Monday said lenders must account for possible loss from the loan repayment holidays they offered borrowers affected by the coronavirus last week, to ensure banks keep stakeholders informed of action taken amid the outbreak.
The Australian  Prudential  (LON:PRU) Regulation Authority (APRA) said banks must publicly disclose the volume of such loans as well as the nature and terms of any repayment deferral. Banks do not need to classify the loans as being in arrears, APRA said.
Measures to combat the health and economic impact of the outbreak are threatening the A$3.9 trillion ($2.24 trillion) loan books of the country's four largest banks that dominate 80% of the market.
Last week, the banks announced coronavirus support packages that provide affected borrowers - mainly small businesses and home loan customers - with an option to defer repayment for up to six months.
Shares in Commonwealth Bank of Australia (AX:CBA), Westpac Banking Corp (AX:WBC), National Australia Bank Ltd (AX:NAB) and Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd (AX:ANZ) have fallen as much as 31% to 42% in the month since coronavirus cases began spreading beyond China, the virus' country of origin.
Their shares were 7% to 10% lower in Monday morning trade, while the broader market (AXJO) was 5.8% lower.
The government and regulators have also provided banks with several tools to ensure they can keep funding Australians who, just as in the rest of the world, have been forced to abruptly halt economic activity.
The measures for banks include an emergency interest rate cut, A$90 billion in ultra-cheap 0.25% funding for three years for small business loans, and a guarantee of up to A$20 billion on business loan losses.
Banks have not passed on the emergency rate cut to variable home loan customers, nor the ultra-cheap funding to businesses in full. Instead, they have agreed to provide the option to defer loan repayment for six months and capitalize the interest, lowered some loan interest rates and raised selected deposit rates.
Driven mainly by impairment in business loans - about a quarter of the four banks' loan books - the banks are likely to see bad debt charges of A$15 billion to A$20 billion in the next 12 months, or about 0.33% to 55% of total loans, analyst estimates showed.
By not passing on the lower rates in full to the majority of customers, the banks are able to protect their profit, analysts said.
""We estimate that the benefit from no pass-through to home loan borrowers offsets the higher repricing on some small business loans, the drag from low cost deposits ... and increase to term deposit pricing,"" said analysts at JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM).
APRA said it will advise banks of the specific reporting treatment for loans that are subject to support arrangements.
With one of the highest coronavirus testing rates, the number of positive cases in Australia has surpassed 1,000 with the two most populous states of Victoria and New South Wales recording the most infections.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian retailers, casinos and toll road operators pulled profit guidance on Monday as unprecedented curbs on public life to combat the coronavirus pandemic hit demand, sending their shares into a tailspin.
The benchmark index (AXJO) plunged more than 8% at the open as investors fretted over the damaging economic costs of stringent new social distancing rules.
Seeking to contain the pandemic, the government ordered the closure of indoor sporting venues, pubs and clubs, cafes & restaurants as well as gyms and cinemas.
Hotels, eating out, art and recreation, air travel and other services make up nearly 10% of Australia's A$2 trillion ($1.1 trillion) economy.
The government on Sunday pledged A$66.4 billion to help affected business and individuals though economists say another support package will be needed.
""Increasing social distancing including the increasing adoption of alternative work arrangements – working from home – add further downside risk to activity,"" said Su-Lin Ong, economist at RBC which is predicting Australia's first recession in nearly three decades this year.
""The knock-on impact to the labour market is emerging and will be significant,"" Ong added.
At least 14 companies urged the country's stock exchange to halt trading in their shares to shelter them from the extreme volatility in the share market.
Australia's main 200-share index has dropped more than 20% over the last two weeks as worries about the pandemic and its impact on the global economy wreaked havoc in financial markets.
Losses on Monday were led by the heavyweight financial index (AXFJ) which crashed almost 8% to touch its lowest in almost nine years.
The number of coronavirus cases in Australia has surpassed 1,000 with the two most populous states of Victoria and New South Wales (NSW) recording the most infections. Globally, the pandemic has killed over 14,000 and infected well over 300,000 in a crippling blow to economic activity and daily life.
Analysts are expecting mortgage defaults to rise at the country's biggest lenders - Commonwealth Bank (AX:CBA), Westpac (AX:WBC), National Australia Bank (AX:NAB) and ANZ Banking Group (AX:ANZ) as the unemployment rate starts to creep higher.
Other sectors were hammered too.
Toll road operator Atlas Arteria (AX:ALX) suspended its first-half guidance and delayed dividend distribution. Shares in the company pummeled 32% and was among the top loser on the benchmark index.
JB Hifi's (AX:JBH) stock also took a pounding after the retailer withdrew its current financial year sales and earnings guidance citing ""an increasing level of uncertainty"" arising from COVID-19.
SkyCity Entertainment Group (NZ:SKC) said it would shut its casino in Adelaide in line with an Australian government order and withdrew its full-year earnings forecast.

There have also been calls to shorten trading hours or for shut downs for a time to help calm stock markets rocked by outbreak.
The New York Stock Exchange will temporarily close its trading floors and move fully to electronic trading from March 23.
Here are some of the measures taken by exchanges across the world so far:
EUROPE

** On March 17, the Philippines became the first country to suspend trade only to reopen later that week after the government exempted financial trading platforms from a strict coronavirus quarantine procedures.
THAILAND
** The country revised its circuit breaker rules that will last until the end of June
** New rules will see a 8% drop trigger a 30-minute halt in trade; a 15% fall to initiate a 30-minute halt, while a 20% plunge will see it halted for an hour
SOUTH KOREA

(Reuters) - Futures on safe-haven U.S. Treasuries jumped at the open Sunday night, implying Friday's fall in ten-year Treasury note yields would continue as more states joined the shutdown of huge swaths of the American economy to contain the runaway spread of coronavirus.
By Sunday night, nearly one in three Americans were under orders to close up shop and stay home as the list of states imposing lockdowns expanded to include Ohio, Louisiana, Delaware, New York, California, Illinois, Connecticut and New Jersey.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Fox News Sunday that the coronavirus economic relief bill being finalized by the U.S. Congress would include a one-time $3,000 payment for families and allow the Federal Reserve to leverage up to $4 trillion of liquidity to support the nation's economy.
Mnuchin said the additional liquidity measures would allow the U.S. central bank to help a broad base of businesses to get through next 90 to 120 days.
A measure that would pump well over $1 trillion into the economy to help companies and unemployed workers faltered after it failed to get the necessary 60 votes in the 100-member Senate to clear a procedural hurdle after days of negotiations. Democrats and Republicans now move back to the negotiating table.
The CBOT contract on the U.S. 10-year note  was last up 31/32nd with an implied yield of 0.67 percent, closing back in on the 10-year's record-low yield of 0.318% on March 9. 
S&P 500 futures  fell the maximum allowed limit after their open, halting trade as investors displayed a continued aversion to risk. 
U.S. stocks have already fallen more than 30% from their mid-February peak as the pandemic has spread, with even the safest areas of the bond market experiencing liquidity stress in a market rout not seen since the 2008 financial crisis. Even so, the pain may not be over yet, analysts and portfolio managers told Reuters on Sunday.

""This is a biological event,"" said Nela Richardson, investment strategist at Edward Jones in St. Louis. ""The market is a mere symptom of the global pandemic.""

SYDNEY/HONG KONG (Reuters) - Asian shares sank on Monday as a rising tide of national lockdowns threatened to overwhelm policymakers' frantic efforts to cushion what is likely to be a deep global recession.
""Further deterioration in the COVID-19 outbreak is severely damaging the global economy,""  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analysts warned on Monday. ""We expect global growth to dip close to GFC lows, and U.S. growth to a 74-year low in 2020.""
In a taste of the pain to come, E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 dived 5% at the start of the Asian trading session, and were last off 4.5%. EUROSTOXXX 50 futures plummeted 6.1% and FTSE futures 5.6%.
UBS Australian head of equities distribution George Kanaan said global financial markets were currently gripped by fear, which seemed unlikely to ease any time soon, despite the co-ordinated efforts of governments and central banks around the world.
""I have been in the financial markets for 27 years and I have never seen anything like this,"" he told Reuters by telephone from Sydney.
""This is unprecedented in terms of fears and there are two elements driving that.
""First is that this involves masses of people. In the GFC, that was an event that occurred in the investment banks around the world, it didn’t involve people on the street. The second is that social media is helping to drive this fear and panic.""
In Asian trade, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan lost 5.01%, with New Zealand's market shedding a record 10% as the government closed all non-essential businesses.
Shanghai blue chips dropped 2.51%, though Japan's Nikkei rose 2.0% aided by expectations of more aggressive asset buying by the Bank of Japan. In Australia, the S&P/ASX200 dropped 5.62% to take the index to a seven-year low.
Globally, analysts are dreading data on weekly U.S. jobless claims due on Thursday amid forecasts they could balloon by 750,000, and maybe by more than a million.
U.S. stocks have already fallen more than 30% from their mid-February peak and even the safest areas of the bond market are experiencing liquidity stress as distressed funds are forced to sell good assets to cover positions gone bad.
In contrast to the response by authorities to the global health crisis, however, are calls from some on Wall Street to ease restrictions as soon as possible to give the economy room to recover.
""Extreme measures to flatten the virus 'curve' is sensible-for a time-to stretch out the strain on health infrastructure,"" former Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein tweeted. ""But crushing the economy, jobs and morale is also a health issue-and beyond. Within a very few weeks let those with a lower risk to the disease return to work.""
WAITING ON THE DISEASE
E.L.&C. Baillieu financial advisor James Rosenberg said investors would remain cautious as a growing numbers of cities around the world entered lockdown.
""The market is going to remain very volatile because nobody knows how to price a looming shutdown,"" he said.
""The turning point will be a slowing in the rates of infection and we are probably weeks away from that happening – but it will happen with very tough social measures,"" he said.
The mounting economic toll led to a major rally in sovereign bonds late last week, with efforts by central banks to restore liquidity in the market allowing for more two-way trade.
Yields on the benchmark U.S. 10-year note were down at 0.80%, having dived all the way to 0.84% on Friday from a top of 1.28%. 
In New Zealand, the central bank announced its first outright purchase of government paper aiming to inject much-needed liquidity into the local market.
In currency markets, the first instinct on Monday was to dump those leveraged to global growth and commodity prices, sending the Australian dollar down 0.8% to $0.5749.
The U.S. dollar started firm but took a step back after partisan battles in the U.S. Senate stopped a coronavirus response bill from advancing.
The dollar eased 0.6% to 110.13 yen, while the euro recouped losses to be up 0.3% at $1.0727.
Against a basket of currencies the dollar slipped 0.5% to 101.9.
The dollar had been a major gainer last week as investors fled to the liquidity of the world's reserve currency, while some funds, companies and countries desperately sought more cash to cover their dollar borrowings.
The steady rise in the dollar undermined gold, which slipped 0.3% to $1,493.83 per ounce. 

Oil prices turned mixed after opening sharply lower. Brent crude futures slipped $1.05 to $26.02 a barrel, while U.S. crude was down 12c to $22.51.

The agreement could put an end to a bitter fight over Occidental's ill-timed purchase of rival Anadarko Petroleum (NYSE:APC) last year, a bet on the continued growth of U.S. shale. After closing that deal, the market turned against Occidental, with oil prices diving more than 60% this year as the global coronavirus outbreak cut oil demand and OPEC and Russia launched an oil-price war.
If the settlement talks conclude successfully, Icahn associates Andrew Langham and Nicholas Graziano would get board seats, and Icahn would have a say in the naming of a third independent director, the source said. 
An announcement could come later this week, alongside an official announcement on the appointment of former Occidental CEO Stephen Chazen as Occidental's new chairman, the source said.
The Wall Street Journal https://on.wsj.com/3bfiRQE was the first to report that Occidental was nearing a truce in the proxy fight with Icahn.
The oil price collapse has left Occidental with about $40 billion in debt and dwindling means of covering operating expenses. This month it slashed its shareholder dividend and unveiled a new round of spending cuts.
The U.S. oil producer's market value fell to $9.16 billion on Friday, far below the $38 billion it paid last August for Anadarko.
Equity researcher Evercore ISI on Thursday cut its forecast for the company to a $3-a-share loss this year, from no profit previously. Even with the company's recent dividend and capex cuts, it needs Brent oil prices at $38 per barrel to cover both dividend and capital spending, according to Evercore ISI. Brent closed around $27 on Friday.
Icahn holds around 10% of Occidental shares and had promised a proxy fight to win control of the company. Occidental has sharply criticized Icahn and attacked his slate of board nominees as inadequate for the job.
Occidental this month said it would issue a shareholder rights offering, often known as a ""poison pill"" because it is designed to discourage takeovers by diluting the ownership interest of a hostile party.

Icahn and Occidental were not immediately available for comment.

Australia's No. 2 airline said more information would be provided in the coming days.
Virgin said last week it would ground all international flights and cut its domestic capacity in half as travel demand plunges due to the coronavirus outbreak.
Moody's on Friday downgraded Virgin's credit rating to B3 from B2 and placed it on review for further downgrade.
The ratings agency cited a sharp fall in passenger traffic that will result in significant negative free cash flow, a weakening liquidity profile and higher leverage in the financial year ending June 30.
Larger rival Qantas Airways Ltd (AX:QAN) said last week it would halt all international flights from late March until at least the end of May and put two-thirds of its workforce on leave.

""Because many of our businesses are in industries like travel, leisure and wellness, they are in a massive battle to survive and save jobs"", Branson wrote in a blog. He didn't say if the $250 million just represented salaries of furloughed staff.
""Our airlines have had to ground almost all their planes; our cruise line has had to postpone its launch; our health clubs and hotels have had to close their doors and all bookings to our holiday company have stopped"", he added.
Virgin companies employ more than 70,000 people across 35 countries. 
Branson had told Reuters late last month that the new Virgin cruise line would overcome coronavirus fears, but the outbreak has since spread to more places and has jolted markets and industries across the world.

Branson - one of Britain's best-known businessmen who launched his career in the 1970s in records before expanding into airlines, banking, TV, healthclubs and space - described the crisis as the ""most significant"" during his lifetime.

(Reuters) - Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) will stop shipping non-essential products to consumers in Italy and France, the company said on Saturday, representing an escalation in the e-commerce giant's response in regions hard hit by the coronavirus outbreak.
An Amazon spokesman said the company made the decision due to a spike in orders and the need to respect anti-coronavirus safety measures in the workplaces.
""We will temporarily stop taking orders on some non-essential products on Amazon.it and Amazon.fr,"" Amazon.com said in a statement. ""This lets fulfillment center associates focus on receiving and shipping the products customers need most at this time.""
Amazon considers baby products; health and household items; beauty and personal care; groceries; and industrial, scientific, and pet supplies as essential products.
The world's largest online retailer said consumers in Italy and France can still order non-essential products from sellers on Amazon who do not use Amazon logistics to fulfill and ship orders, but deliveries could take longer.
More than 274,800 people have been infected with coronavirus across the world and 11,389 have died, according to a Reuters tally. In Italy, the death toll rose by 18.4% on Friday, reaching 4,032. France reported 78 new deaths on Friday, reaching a total of 450.
Both countries have announced lock down orders to slow the spread of the virus.
The move comes on the heels of actions Amazon took on Tuesday when it said it will only receive vital supplies at its U.S. and UK and other European warehouses until April 5 to free up inventory space for medical and household goods.
""Effective immediately, Amazon will stop receiving FBA (fulfillment by Amazon) orders from customers on non-essential products on its Italy (Amazon.it) and France (Amazon.fr) site, so that operations employees can focus on fulfilling and delivering on the orders that consumers need the most now,"" according to a message Amazon.com sent to Chinese sellers over the WeChat social media platform.

The announcement was made to China-based sellers who may see their businesses taking a hit. Chinese sellers account for 45% of active sellers on Amazon.fr, and 44% on Amazon.it, according to data from Marketplace Pulse, an e-commerce research firm.

796,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 22, 2020 04:20PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Goldman injects $1 billion into own money-market funds after heavy withdrawals,"By Tim McLaughlin
(Reuters) -  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS) poured more than $1 billion into two of its prime money-market portfolios this week due to heavy investor withdrawals, according to a filing with the U.S. securities regulator.
The Wall Street bank purchased $722.4 million in assets from its Goldman Sachs Financial Square (NYSE:SQ) Money Market Fund  and $301.2 million from its Goldman Sachs Fund Square Prime Obligations Fund.
Its support came as markets had another violently volatile week over concerns about the coronavirus pandemic, and represents an extraordinary move in the staid money-market fund industry.
Goldman, which disclosed the moves on Friday in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, did not have an immediate comment.
The bank repurchased securities from its two funds on Thursday after investors withdrew a net $8.1 billion from them during a four-day stretch, according to the disclosure.
Industrywide, investors pulled tens of billions of dollars from prime money-market funds, which buy top-rated corporate debt. Although they are among the tamest investment vehicles, they can be riskier than portfolios that rely more on U.S. government bonds.
The U.S. Federal Reserve rolled out three emergency credit programs this week to battle a global economic shutdown that has roiled the $3.8 trillion money-market mutual fund industry. The Fed is in effect encouraging banks to buy assets from those funds, insulating them from having to sell assets at a discount if they come under pressure from households or firms wanting to withdraw money.
Weekly liquidity levels at the nearly $18 billion Goldman Sachs Fund Square Money Market Fund dropped to 34% on Thursday from 43% on Monday. SEC rules on weekly liquidity dictate that funds have to keep at least 30% of their portfolios in securities that can be converted to cash in five business days.
During that four-day stretch, investors made $6.84 billion in net withdrawals from the fund, Goldman disclosures show.
Goldman's support is unusual, but it does not stand alone in supporting its funds during the coronavirus panic. Bank of New York Mellon Corp (N:BK) also stepped in twice this week with a total of $2.1 billion to prop up Dreyfus Cash Management.
That $10.5 billion portfolio was also hit by heavy investor withdrawals. BNY bought $1.2 billion from the prime money-market fund on Wednesday and then another $949 million on Thursday, according to fund disclosures, part of which was first reported by the Financial Times. 
If a prime fund's weekly liquidity level falls below 30%, SEC rules give its board discretion to introduce redemption fees of up to 2% to slow down investor withdrawals. They can also put up gates for up to 10 business days.
Those moves, however, would not be welcomed by investors. That's why fund sponsors like Goldman and BNY Mellon can provide capital support so liquidity levels don't drop below the threshold. Other fund sponsors have stayed more heavily weighted in liquidity.
The recent market panic has been reminiscent of what happened in 2008, when money-market fund problems threatened to freeze up global markets.
The Reserve Primary Fund, which held Lehman Brothers debt, was overwhelmed by investor redemption requests after the investment bank went bankrupt. The fund's shares fell below $1 apiece, known as ""breaking the buck,"" and it was forced to liquidate.

At least 21 other prime funds received support from their parent companies to avoid a similar fate, a Federal Reserve study later found. The U.S. Treasury temporarily supported money market funds as the crisis intensified.

DUBAI (Reuters) - Emirates is suspending flights to cities including New York, Delhi and Melbourne due to the coronavirus outbreak that has severely hit travel demand.
The state-owned airline is temporarily ceasing services to 104 destinations, representing 65% of its global network, according to an updated list posted on its website on Saturday that included previously announced affected routes. 
It flew to 159 international destinations as of December 2019 from its Dubai hub.
Emirates, which did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment, is also suspending flights to Mumbai, Paris and Rio de Janeiro, among others.
Emirates does not operate domestic flights and its international network is crucial to its Gulf hub model that transformed Dubai into the world's busiest international airport six years ago. 
Abu Dhabi's Etihad Airways also on Saturday announced more flight suspensions including to Brussels, Islamabad and Zurich.
Airlines around the world have canceled hundreds of flights due to the deadly virus outbreak which has killed more than 9,000 globally. The United Arab Emirates has recorded 153 cases and two deaths. 
Some countries are virtually in lock down as governments try to stop the spread of the virus. Many countries are imposing tight entry requirements, including banning foreigners from entering, and some have suspended flights.
Emirates is encouraging staff to take unpaid leave and has frozen recruitment, warning employees the epidemic could be the biggest challenge it has faced in many years.
Many airlines worldwide say they may not survive the crisis, which deepened on Thursday as German flag carrier Lufthansa (DE:LHAG) warned the industry might not stay afloat without state aid if the pandemic persists.

Global industry body IATA is urging Middle East governments to support their airlines, warning that carriers in the region are facing a liquidity crisis putting hundreds of thousands of jobs at risk.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Nearly one in three Americans was under orders on Sunday to stay home to slow the spread of the coronavirus pandemic as Ohio, Louisiana and Delaware became the latest states to enact broad restrictions, along with the city of Philadelphia.
The three states join New York, California, Illinois, Connecticut and New Jersey, home to 101 million Americans combined, as cases nationwide topped 32,000, with more than 415 dead, according to a Reuters tally. (Graphic: https://tmsnrt.rs/2w7hX9T) 
""Every piece of evidence that I can lay my hands on indicates that we're at an absolutely crucial time in this war and what we do now will make all the difference in the world,"" said Ohio Governor Mike DeWine. ""What we do now will slow this invader. It will slow this invader so our healthcare system ... will have time to treat casualties.""
In the U.S. Senate, partisan disagreement blocked a massive coronavirus response bill from advancing, with Democrats saying the Republican measure focused too heavily on helping corporations. But Democratic Senate leader Chuck Schumer said he believed differences could be overcome in the next 24 hours.
Ohio has 351 cases and three deaths, while Louisiana has 837 cases and 20 deaths, several in a senior-care facility. Louisiana has the third highest number of cases per capita and saw a 10-fold increase in cases in the past week, Governor John Bel Edwards said. 
Ohio's order will go into effect at midnight EDT on Monday and stay in effect until April 6. Louisiana's order goes into effect at 5 p.m. CDT on Monday and lasts through April 12. Delaware's order starts at 8 a.m. EDT on Tuesday. 
Dallas County in Texas, home to over 2.5 million people, and Philadelphia, with 1.6 million residents, told non-essential businesses on Sunday to close and residents to stay home.
In Kentucky, non-essential businesses must close by 8 p.m. EDT on Monday but authorities stopped short of ordering residents to stay home.
Republican U.S. Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky on Sunday became the first member of the Senate to announce he had tested positive for the coronavirus. At least two members of the House of Representatives previously said they tested positive.
Around the globe, billions are adapting to a new reality, with countries such as Italy, Spain and France on lockdown and several South American nations taking similar measures to try to stay ahead of the contagion, as global cases exceeded 325,000 and deaths topped 14,000. 
The mayor of New York City, the epicenter of the nation's coronavirus epidemic, on Sunday described the outbreak as the biggest domestic crisis since the Great Depression and called for the U.S. military to mobilize to help keep the healthcare system from becoming overwhelmed.
""If we don't get more ventilators in the next 10 days, people will die who don't have to die,"" said Mayor Bill de Blasio, as the nation's most populous city saw COVID-19 cases top 9,600 and deaths climb to 63.
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo urged the federal government to take over acquisition of medical supplies so states do not have to compete with each other for desperately needed resources. 
Help is not coming quickly enough, Cuomo said.
""Time matters, minutes count, and this is literally a matter of life and death,"" he said. ""At the same time, there is not going to be chaos, there is not going to be anarchy. Life is going to go on. Different. But life is going to go on."" 
Cuomo gave New York City officials 24 hours to come up with a plan to deal with residents still congregating in parks and other places and not practicing social distancing.
MEDICAL CRISIS
De Blasio said New York City was not getting needed medical supplies from the federal government to contend with the rapid spread of the sometimes deadly illness.
Hospitals are scrambling for protective equipment for healthcare workers and for ventilators as they brace for a wave of patients who will need help breathing as severe cases often lead to pneumonia and decreased lung function. 
Over the past week, U.S. President Donald Trump's administration has been pushing for aggressive steps to stem the economic hit, after Trump spent several weeks downplaying the virus' risks.
Trump said on Sunday the National Guard would help New York, California and Washington state respond to the coronavirus crisis. He said the U.S. hospital ship Mercy would be in Los Angeles within a week and provided detailed numbers for the first time on the types and quantities of medical supplies sent to outbreak centers.
Vice President Mike Pence said 254,000 Americans had been tested for the coronavirus and 10% were positive. 
GREATEST CRISIS 'SINCE GREAT DEPRESSION'
The number of cases of the highly contagious respiratory illness in the United States and Spain are exceeded only by China and Italy. Italy reported record numbers of daily coronavirus deaths last week.
""This is going to be the greatest crisis domestically since the Great Depression,"" de Blasio told CNN, referring to the economic crisis of the 1930s. ""This is why we need a full-scale mobilization of the American military."" 
Texas Governor Greg Abbott lamented the lack of personal protective equipment (PPE) available for health workers. He said they were seeing delivery dates in July. 
""That's not going to work. We need delivery dates tomorrow,"" Abbott said at a briefing. ""We have ready money today for anybody who can sell us PPE. We'll cut you a check on the spot.""

DUBAI (Reuters) - Emirates, one of the world's biggest long-haul airlines, said on Sunday it would stop nearly all passenger flights this week and cut staff wages by as much as half because of the coronavirus impact on travel demand.
The state-owned Dubai carrier had already announced the suspension of nearly 70% of its network of 159 destinations, asked staff to go on unpaid leave and frozen recruitment as the industry faces one of its biggest ever challenges. 
""As a global network airline, we find ourselves in a situation where we cannot viably operate passenger services until countries reopen their borders and travel confidence returns,"" Emirates Chairman Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed al-Maktoum said in a statement.
The Dubai based airline, which initially said it was stopping all passenger operations by Wednesday, will maintain some services to 13 countries for repatriation flights at the request of governments.
Flights would continue as long as borders remain open and there is demand, it said. Cargo flights will also operate.
It operates a fleet of 270 aircraft, mostly Airbus (PA:AIR) A380 and Boeing (N:BA) 777 passenger jets.
Emirates employees told Reuters they were not surprised most flights were being suspended.
""There is no other choice, really,"" one said on the condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to speak to media.
International connectivity is crucial for Emirates' Gulf hub model, which transformed Dubai six years ago into the world's busiest international airport. It does not operate domestic flights and most of its passengers transit through Dubai.
Emirates Group, a state holding company that includes the airline among its assets, will enforce a temporary 25% to 50% reduction in basic salary for the majority of employees. 
""I feel uncertain for the future but at least we still have our jobs and are still getting paid,"" an employee said.
The Group had 100,000 employees, including more than 21,000 cabin crew and 4,000 pilots, at end-March 2019, the close of its last financial year.
Emirates President Tim Clark, who is due to step down in June, and Gary Chapman, president of the holding group's airport and travel services company, will forgo their basic salaries for three months. 
""We want to avoid cutting jobs,"" Sheikh Ahmed said. 
In an email to staff, seen by Reuters, he said he was confident the airline he has been chairman of since it was founded in 1985 would survive and asked staff to ""keep their spirits up."" 
""For now, we have to preserve our resources, while preparing ourselves for the rebound,"" he said.

803,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 22, 2020 11:45AM ET</span>",Investor Ackman tweets to Trump: Close down the country,"By Svea Herbst-Bayliss
BOSTON (Reuters) - Billionaire investor William Ackman, who has long worried about risks posed by the coronavirus, called on the Trump administration on Wednesday to seal off the country for 30 days and said stocks would ""soar"" if such restrictions were imposed.
""The only answer is to shut down the country for the next 30 days and close the borders,"" Ackman said in a post on Twitter, adding: ""Tell all Americans that you are putting us on an extended Spring Break at home with family.""
Ackman also said he had bought stock in private equity group Blackstone (NYSE:BX) Group as well as portfolio companies his hedge fund Pershing Square (NYSE:SQ) Capital Management already owns, including Hilton Worldwide Holdings.
Ackman, who has some 58,000 Twitter followers but rarely tweets, took to President Donald Trump's preferred communication platform to publicize his plan for proposed action.
After markets closed with fresh losses and the Dow wiped out the last of its gains put on since Trump was inaugurated, Ackman told Reuters shutting down U.S. borders for 30 days was the only way to limit the virus' spread and save industries on the verge of collapse.
""If President Trump were to go on television, with no one standing next to him, and say that he is shutting everything down and tell people to work from home and stay at home for 30 days, this thing could be killed and markets would soar. It might take some time for markets to recover but I'm confident they would recover fully,"" he said.
Ackman, who normally considers himself an optimist, began worrying about the effects of the virus weeks ago and said he began preparing personally and professionally for a pandemic that he estimated could kill between 1% and 2% of the world's population.
""People need to be scared and take this seriously,"" he said, urging the government to essentially force most Americans to stay home for a month.
Without people wandering around outside, the virus' re-infection rate would be killed, he said, adding ""and then you kill the virus ... 30 days would give us a cushion.""
Ackman protected his portfolio with a hedge that helped turn late February losses into gains in early March. Through March 17, however, the Pershing Square Holdings fund lost ground and is now down 6.5% for the year, data from the hedge fund show.
Ackman broadcast his policy prescription in an emotional interview with CNBC on Wednesday and then again on Twitter.
I am sure ""the president will do the right thing in temporarily shutting down the country and closing the borders. If that happens, we can win the war against the virus,"" Ackman tweeted.
The White House responded by saying that Trump has ensured that all Americans would be taken care of, including affected industries and small businesses, CNBC reported.
Ackman is especially concerned about the hotel, airline, restaurant and auto industries, saying they may not have a long lifeline. 
""Hotels rent rooms for a night and if no one comes, they are done,"" he said. He called Hilton a ""canary in the coal mine,"" and warned that without fast action the hotel industry could tumble to zero.
In addition to buying Blackstone stock, Ackman said he had been loading up on the companies already in his portfolio like Lowe's and Restaurant Brands, as well as Hilton. 
Ackman, who runs $6.5 billion investment firm Pershing Square Capital Management from New York, moved his family, including his father who has battled lung cancer, out of the city several weeks ago.
He said he spends a lot of time thinking about so-called black swan events and began worrying about the coronavirus' potentially catastrophic effects on public health and the economy many weeks ago.

Last year, Ackman's publicly traded hedge fund surged 58%, making it one of the industry's best performers. Earlier this year, he sold off a position in Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) before the coffee chain's stock tumbled some 34% amid warnings for people to avoid restaurants, bars, and coffee shops.

807,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 22, 2020 09:25AM ET</span>","Already retired, or close to it? How to think about volatility in perilous times","By Mark Miller
CHICAGO (Reuters) - The breathtaking coronavirus-induced plunge of the stock market has unnerved retirement investors of all ages, but it poses special risks for people close to, or already retired. Unlike younger workers with many years ahead of earning and saving, older investors are less able to fall back on income from work and may have less ability to wait out their losses.
How should older investors think about their portfolios now? In one sense, this is the wrong question. A much bigger concern is uncertainty about the resilience of the economy as major sectors grind to a halt as we fight the virus. Still, here are some big-picture thoughts about portfolios from the experts, and some tactical moves to consider.
First, think of the big picture, said Allan Roth, a CFP and head of Wealth Logic in Colorado Springs, Colorado. 
“Markets going down for the last three and a half weeks is statistically rare, but 11 years of a bull market? This is the first time that has happened, so it’s the larger perspective that matters.”
“People are working toward financial independence, and suddenly, the market goes way down in a very fast, shocking manner,” Roth added. “So the natural instinct is not acting out of fear, but to protect what's left - 'I would love to get out of the market now, it would make me feel so much better.' And my logic tells me it's the absolute wrong thing to do.""
And in this moment, it is critical to understand the difference between volatility and risk.
Volatility is what you will always experience from time to time in the stock market. Risk, on the other hand, is about uncertainty, and the fact that we cannot predict the future. And there is risk in any investment.
For example, selling off your portfolio and stuffing your mattress with cash carries the risk that inflation will erode the value of your savings - sharply - over time. If inflation continues at a 2% annual pace, cash will lose half its value over a 25-year period.
REBALANCING
Roth is a big fan of rebalancing your portfolio periodically. This keeps you on track with whatever equity-fixed income allocation you have determined is right for you. But it also can improve returns over time, because it lets you run against the market herd without even thinking about it - when stocks surge, you are selling a bit toward the top of the market; when they drop, you are buying the dip.
Roth calculates that an all-stock portfolio so far this century (through the end of February, using total market index funds, two-thirds U.S. and one-third international) has enjoyed a 4.98% annualized return, while a balanced portfolio (60% stocks, 40% bonds) earned 5.36%.
TARGET ALLOCATIONS 
For retirees, how much of that allocation should go to equities? If you are looking for a proxy on how professional money managers think about that question, look no further than target date funds, which automatically reduce participants’ exposure to stocks as retirement approaches.  Target  (NYSE:TGT) date funds have become dominant favorites in 401(k) plans in recent years, and a growing number of participants are keeping them in retirement, either by staying in their workplace plans or using them in rollover IRAs.
Fidelity Investments' target date series hold 51% equity at the point of retirement - an allocation that the firm decreased by 3.5% two years ago. And last year, it boosted global diversification within the equity portion of its portfolio.
Along with stocks, the funds hold 41% in bonds and 8% in cash equivalents. 
The balance between equities, bonds and cash differs somewhat among the three largest target date fund providers, depending very much on their view of the primary goals for retirees. That reflects a Fidelity view that diversification - including cash - is critical. 
“We think investors at the point of retirement are thinking mainly about the balance of risks that they're likely to experience in the future,” said Andrew Dierdorf, one of Fidelity’s target date fund portfolio managers. “Our goal is to help them maintain their standard of living in retirement.”
That means retired investors will need to achieve returns from equities over the long run, especially since they may well live an additional 20 or 30 years, he notes. But the diminished ability to earn income from work - an income stream that generally behaves like income from bonds would - points to the need for diversification, he adds.
T. Rowe Price has a more aggressive approach. In February, it adjusted the glide path of its retirement funds target date series, with the equities allocation gradually falling to 30% at the end point (30 years after retirement), up from 20% earlier. Investors in this series hold 55% in equities at the initial point of retirement.
The higher equity allocation reflects the saving shortfalls of most investors and rising longevity, notes Wyatt Lee, head of target date strategies for the firm. “We can’t fully invest our way out of a savings problem,” he said. “But by maintaining a reasonable level of growth over the long term, we can continue to help support that income stream - even if it means more short-term volatility.”

The bank approached the Fed about a temporary or permanent lifting of the $1.95 trillion asset cap, which has curbed its growth and profitability since it was imposed in 2018, the FT said https://www.ft.com/content/af0c45a8-6afa-11ea-800d-da70cff6e4d3 on Saturday, citing people familiar with the matter.
Wells Fargo did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Removing the cap has been a priority for Chief Executive Charles Scharf and the issue has become acute as the Fed tries to encourage banks to extend credit to customers facing income shortfalls, FT said.

Wells Fargo has suspended residential property foreclosure sales, evictions and involuntary automobile repossessions due to the coronavirus outbreak and temporarily closed some branches, adjusting operating hours of other branches, relocating employees and increasing charitable donations.

The streaming giant, which has already deployed a way to reduce its traffic on networks in Italy and Spain by a quarter, on Saturday said it would do the same for the rest of Europe in the next two days.
Netflix said it will remove the highest bandwidth streams within each resolution category for the next 30 days in Europe wherein users might notice a slight decrease in video quality within each category.
""Our goal is simple: to maintain the quality of service for our members, while supporting ISPs who are facing unprecedented strain on their networks,"" the company said https://media.netflix.com/en/company-blog/reducing-netflix-traffic-where-its-needed.
Netflix said it will continue to adhere with normal procedures for all other networks ""until and unless they experience issues of their own"".
The world's largest streaming media service had said on Thursday it would reduce bit rates across all of its streams in Europe, in effect cutting traffic on its European networks by 25% to preserve the smooth functioning of the internet during the coronavirus crisis.
While partners in regions such as Latin America want the company to reduce its bandwidth as soon as possible, others wanted to continue business as usual, Netflix said.
Netflix had over 42 million subscribers in Europe, Africa and the Middle East at the end of the first quarter of 2019, showed an exchange filing, with the bulk estimated to be in Europe.
Alphabet Inc's (O:GOOGL) YouTube and Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) joined Netflix (O:NFLX) in responding to a call by European Union industry chief Thierry Breton to cut picture quality to prevent overload.
Walt  Disney  Co's (N:DIS) streaming service Disney+, which is set to launch in Britain and most major European markets on March 24, has delayed its launch in France by two weeks at the request of the French government.

The telecoms industry has in recent days reported a spike in data traffic on networks as thousands of people were forced to stay home in an attempt to curb the spread of the highly contagious coronavirus, which has infected more than 274,800 people globally and led to the deaths of 11,389 people worldwide.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. financial services firms and their staff must be designated as ""essential"" to keep markets functioning as more Americans stay home to mitigate the spread of the coronavirus, a leading financial industry trade group said on Friday. 
""It is imperative that financial services firms and personnel that are critical to maintaining financial market operations and that service institutional and/or retail clients be deemed essential,"" Ken Bentsen, chief executive of the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (SIFMA) wrote in a letter to the country's governors.
The need was especially pressing ""during a time when access to people’s savings and investments are so important,"" he wrote.
New York followed California on Friday in announcing tough measures to combat the fast-spreading virus, requiring all non-essential workers to stay home and all non-essential businesses to close. California has asked nearly 40 million people to stay home under the so-called ""shelter in place"" order.
While businesses like nail salons, tattoo shops and indoor shopping malls must close, banks and related financial institutions are considered essential businesses and exempt from the New York and California closure orders.
Beyond New York, other key financial market components like exchanges, clearing houses, asset managers and supporting data centers, are scattered across the country, including in New Jersey, Atlanta, Chicago, Boston and elsewhere. 
SIFMA has been leading the industry's business continuity efforts, which have seen thousands of traders moved to remote back-up locations and sent to work from home. 

Even so, the group said in the letter addressed to the National Governors Association it was still vital for some personnel to be able to work onsite. Failing to provide an exemption for staff at banks, broker-dealers and asset managers would ""negatively impair market operations,"" the group said.

815,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 21, 2020 04:15PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Goldman injects $1 billion into own money-market funds after heavy withdrawals,"By Tim McLaughlin
(Reuters) -  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS) poured more than $1 billion into two of its prime money-market portfolios this week due to heavy investor withdrawals, according to a filing with the U.S. securities regulator.
The Wall Street bank purchased $722.4 million in assets from its Goldman Sachs Financial Square (NYSE:SQ) Money Market Fund  and $301.2 million from its Goldman Sachs Fund Square Prime Obligations Fund.
Its support came as markets had another violently volatile week over concerns about the coronavirus pandemic, and represents an extraordinary move in the staid money-market fund industry.
Goldman, which disclosed the moves on Friday in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, did not have an immediate comment.
The bank repurchased securities from its two funds on Thursday after investors withdrew a net $8.1 billion from them during a four-day stretch, according to the disclosure.
Industrywide, investors pulled tens of billions of dollars from prime money-market funds, which buy top-rated corporate debt. Although they are among the tamest investment vehicles, they can be riskier than portfolios that rely more on U.S. government bonds.
The U.S. Federal Reserve rolled out three emergency credit programs this week to battle a global economic shutdown that has roiled the $3.8 trillion money-market mutual fund industry. The Fed is in effect encouraging banks to buy assets from those funds, insulating them from having to sell assets at a discount if they come under pressure from households or firms wanting to withdraw money.
Weekly liquidity levels at the nearly $18 billion Goldman Sachs Fund Square Money Market Fund dropped to 34% on Thursday from 43% on Monday. SEC rules on weekly liquidity dictate that funds have to keep at least 30% of their portfolios in securities that can be converted to cash in five business days.
During that four-day stretch, investors made $6.84 billion in net withdrawals from the fund, Goldman disclosures show.
Goldman's support is unusual, but it does not stand alone in supporting its funds during the coronavirus panic. Bank of New York Mellon Corp (N:BK) also stepped in twice this week with a total of $2.1 billion to prop up Dreyfus Cash Management.
That $10.5 billion portfolio was also hit by heavy investor withdrawals. BNY bought $1.2 billion from the prime money-market fund on Wednesday and then another $949 million on Thursday, according to fund disclosures, part of which was first reported by the Financial Times. 
If a prime fund's weekly liquidity level falls below 30%, SEC rules give its board discretion to introduce redemption fees of up to 2% to slow down investor withdrawals. They can also put up gates for up to 10 business days.
Those moves, however, would not be welcomed by investors. That's why fund sponsors like Goldman and BNY Mellon can provide capital support so liquidity levels don't drop below the threshold. Other fund sponsors have stayed more heavily weighted in liquidity.
The recent market panic has been reminiscent of what happened in 2008, when money-market fund problems threatened to freeze up global markets.
The Reserve Primary Fund, which held Lehman Brothers debt, was overwhelmed by investor redemption requests after the investment bank went bankrupt. The fund's shares fell below $1 apiece, known as ""breaking the buck,"" and it was forced to liquidate.

At least 21 other prime funds received support from their parent companies to avoid a similar fate, a Federal Reserve study later found. The U.S. Treasury temporarily supported money market funds as the crisis intensified.

816,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 21, 2020 03:25PM ET</span>",Airlines appear to come up short in bid to win cash grants in rescue package,"By David Shepardson and Tracy Rucinski
WASHINGTON/CHICAGO (Reuters) - A last-ditch effort by the chief executives of major U.S. airlines to try to win cash grants to weather the coronavirus crisis looked to be unsuccessful, four congressional aides and airline officials said late Saturday.
Airlines had made a last ditch plea urging that $29 billion of $58 billion sought in assistance for airlines be in the form of cash grants. They had offered not to make any job cuts through Aug. 31 if they won the cash and to accept restrictions on executive pay and to forgo paying dividends or stock buybacks.
The CEOs of 10 U.S. passenger and cargo carriers had said in a letter that without direct cash assistance, ""draconian measures"" such as furloughs may be necessary.
Senate Republicans hope to unveil the text of the rescue and stimulus package Sunday that could total $1.6 trillion and is set to include $50 billion in collateralized loan and loan guarantees for passenger airlines and $8 billion for cargo carriers. Senate Democratic Leader Charles Schumer said there was still ""no deal,"" so it is possible the final airline provisions could change in negotiations.
Senator John Thune, the Senate's No. 2 Republican, said earlier airline grants were not winning backing ""at this point, I don't sense support for it here or with the administration. But like I said, nothing is done.""
Airlines are expected to soon turn their attention to applying for government collateralized loans and the terms the legislation will include. The initial Republican plan said the U.S. Treasury could demand stock, warrants or options as part of any airline loans.
The global coronavirus outbreak has forced airlines to cancel tens of thousands of flights and resulted in massive revenue losses. On Saturday, United Airlines said it was canceling 90% of its international flights in April.
United, Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL), American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) Group, FedEx (NYSE:FDX), Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) Co, UPS and others warned in their letter to lawmakers on Saturday that ""time is running out.""
They had urged Congress not to attach additional conditions. 
""We respectfully urge Congress not to pursue opportunistic measures that will hurt, not help our ability to recover,"" they wrote. Some in Congress want airlines to agree to provisions such as limiting baggage and other fees, or committing to flying more environmentally friendly airplanes.
Unions representing workers in different parts of the aviation industry also made final pleas, with the head of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers asking Congress to ""backstop"" the airlines with direct aid for paychecks.
The president of the Association of Flight Attendants, Sara Nelson, blasted Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell saying under his plan ""airlines and airports will cut jobs, and the debt they'll take on will lead to bankruptcies that will further hurt frontline aviation workers while executives get a free pass."" McConnell's office did not comment.
Airlines Monday sought $58 billion in cash grants and loans equally divided, with $50 billion for passenger airlines and $8 billion for cargo carriers. They also sought billions in additional tax relief.
""The breadth and immediacy of the need to act cannot be overstated. It is urgent and unprecedented,"" they wrote Saturday.
Other signatories to the letter were the chief executives of Alaska Airlines, JetBlue Airways, Hawaiian Airlines and Atlas Air Worldwide. 
The Republican bill introduced on Thursday would set aside another $150 billion for a separate fund and Treasury would determine who could qualify. Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co, which has sought $60 billion in U.S. government loan guarantees for itself and the aviation manufacturing sector, could seek loans from that fund.
Senator Ted Cruz, a Republican, tweeted on Saturday that ""some are pushing for a special carve-out just for Boeing & GE. That would be WRONG. Millions are losing jobs; we don’t need bailouts or corporate welfare - those companies should participate in the same liquidity programs as everyone else.""
Boeing on Friday agreed to suspend its dividend, not buy back stock and said its chief executive would forgo pay for the rest of 2020. Boeing and GE did not immediately comment Saturday.

Airport workers, many of whom are contracted, were also pleading with Congress to ensure that they too are protected in any bailout.

DUBAI (Reuters) - Emirates is suspending flights to cities including New York, Delhi and Melbourne due to the coronavirus outbreak that has severely hit travel demand.
The state-owned airline is temporarily ceasing services to 104 destinations, representing 65% of its global network, according to an updated list posted on its website on Saturday that included previously announced affected routes. 
It flew to 159 international destinations as of December 2019 from its Dubai hub.
Emirates, which did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment, is also suspending flights to Mumbai, Paris and Rio de Janeiro, among others.
Emirates does not operate domestic flights and its international network is crucial to its Gulf hub model that transformed Dubai into the world's busiest international airport six years ago. 
Abu Dhabi's Etihad Airways also on Saturday announced more flight suspensions including to Brussels, Islamabad and Zurich.
Airlines around the world have canceled hundreds of flights due to the deadly virus outbreak which has killed more than 9,000 globally. The United Arab Emirates has recorded 153 cases and two deaths. 
Some countries are virtually in lock down as governments try to stop the spread of the virus. Many countries are imposing tight entry requirements, including banning foreigners from entering, and some have suspended flights.
Emirates is encouraging staff to take unpaid leave and has frozen recruitment, warning employees the epidemic could be the biggest challenge it has faced in many years.
Many airlines worldwide say they may not survive the crisis, which deepened on Thursday as German flag carrier Lufthansa (DE:LHAG) warned the industry might not stay afloat without state aid if the pandemic persists.

Global industry body IATA is urging Middle East governments to support their airlines, warning that carriers in the region are facing a liquidity crisis putting hundreds of thousands of jobs at risk.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Billionaire investor William Ackman, who has long worried about risks posed by the coronavirus, called on the Trump administration on Wednesday to seal off the country for 30 days and said stocks would ""soar"" if such restrictions were imposed.
""The only answer is to shut down the country for the next 30 days and close the borders,"" Ackman said in a post on Twitter, adding: ""Tell all Americans that you are putting us on an extended Spring Break at home with family.""
Ackman also said he had bought stock in private equity group Blackstone (NYSE:BX) Group as well as portfolio companies his hedge fund Pershing Square (NYSE:SQ) Capital Management already owns, including Hilton Worldwide Holdings.
Ackman, who has some 58,000 Twitter followers but rarely tweets, took to President Donald Trump's preferred communication platform to publicize his plan for proposed action.
After markets closed with fresh losses and the Dow wiped out the last of its gains put on since Trump was inaugurated, Ackman told Reuters shutting down U.S. borders for 30 days was the only way to limit the virus' spread and save industries on the verge of collapse.
""If President Trump were to go on television, with no one standing next to him, and say that he is shutting everything down and tell people to work from home and stay at home for 30 days, this thing could be killed and markets would soar. It might take some time for markets to recover but I'm confident they would recover fully,"" he said.
Ackman, who normally considers himself an optimist, began worrying about the effects of the virus weeks ago and said he began preparing personally and professionally for a pandemic that he estimated could kill between 1% and 2% of the world's population.
""People need to be scared and take this seriously,"" he said, urging the government to essentially force most Americans to stay home for a month.
Without people wandering around outside, the virus' re-infection rate would be killed, he said, adding ""and then you kill the virus ... 30 days would give us a cushion.""
Ackman protected his portfolio with a hedge that helped turn late February losses into gains in early March. Through March 17, however, the Pershing Square Holdings fund lost ground and is now down 6.5% for the year, data from the hedge fund show.
Ackman broadcast his policy prescription in an emotional interview with CNBC on Wednesday and then again on Twitter.
I am sure ""the president will do the right thing in temporarily shutting down the country and closing the borders. If that happens, we can win the war against the virus,"" Ackman tweeted.
The White House responded by saying that Trump has ensured that all Americans would be taken care of, including affected industries and small businesses, CNBC reported.
Ackman is especially concerned about the hotel, airline, restaurant and auto industries, saying they may not have a long lifeline. 
""Hotels rent rooms for a night and if no one comes, they are done,"" he said. He called Hilton a ""canary in the coal mine,"" and warned that without fast action the hotel industry could tumble to zero.
In addition to buying Blackstone stock, Ackman said he had been loading up on the companies already in his portfolio like Lowe's and Restaurant Brands, as well as Hilton. 
Ackman, who runs $6.5 billion investment firm Pershing Square Capital Management from New York, moved his family, including his father who has battled lung cancer, out of the city several weeks ago.
He said he spends a lot of time thinking about so-called black swan events and began worrying about the coronavirus' potentially catastrophic effects on public health and the economy many weeks ago.

Last year, Ackman's publicly traded hedge fund surged 58%, making it one of the industry's best performers. Earlier this year, he sold off a position in Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) before the coffee chain's stock tumbled some 34% amid warnings for people to avoid restaurants, bars, and coffee shops.

""The risk of funds imposing liquidity fees or gates has risen over the last week and will remain elevated based on our expectation that stress in money markets is likely to persist,"" Moody's said in a research report.
Moody's also said heavy withdrawals from U.S. prime money-market funds is putting downward pressure on their net asset values.
Moody's said its global money market funds outlook has been revised to negative from stable, owing to unprecedented market volatility and economic uncertainty amid the coronavirus pandemic.
Over the last few days, the U.S. prime institutional money market fund segment has lost more than 10% of total portfolio assets. This sharp rise in daily outflow rates has reduced funds’ liquidity levels and placed downward pressure on funds’ net asset values, Moody's said.
Despite the pressures on fund liquidity, U.S. institutional prime money market fund duration and credit profiles remain solid, Moody's said.

(Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) said on Saturday it is raising overtime pay for associates working in its U.S. warehouses as the world's largest online retailer tries to meet the rapidly growing demand for online shopping from consumers stuck at home during the coronavirus outbreak.
Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos, the world's richest person, also said on Saturday, ""My own time and thinking is now wholly focused on COVID-19 and on how Amazon can best play its role,"" according to a message posted on a company website.
Hourly workers at Amazon's U.S. warehouses will receive double pay after 40 hours for overtime, up from the 1.5-times rate, from March 15 through May 9, the rate increase announcement said.
This is the second time the e-commerce giant announced an increase in pay for its workers in a week. On Monday, Amazon hiked the minimum hourly rate for associates to $17 from $15 and announced plans to hire 100,000 warehouse and delivery workers in the United States as the virus outbreak boosts online orders. 
As the virus spreads across the U.S., Amazon has offered unlimited unpaid time off to encourage employees to stay home if they do not feel well. It has also staggered workers shifts and prohibited employees from sitting next to each other in the lunchroom to limit contact. 
But four Democratic U.S. senators, including Cory Booker and Bernie Sanders on Friday expressed concern in a letter to Bezos that Amazon has not taken enough measures to protect its warehouse staff. They specifically asked if the company would provide “time-and-a-half” hazard pay for its workers.
In response to Saturday's wage news, one of the letter's signatories, Senator Robert Menendez said he applauded the decision but that Amazon still had work to do to protect employees.
Bezos said in Saturday's online post that Amazon has ordered ""millions"" of face masks for its on-site staff, but few have been filled because the masks are in low supply and are first going to hospitals at governments' directions.
""When our turn for masks comes, our first priority will be getting them in the hands of our employees and partners working to get essential products to people,"" he said.
Amazon on Thursday reported its first warehouse employee in the United States tested positive for the virus, forcing the company to temporarily shutter the facility in New York. 
As the virus spreads across the United States, several clothing retailers and department-store chains have shut stores, and cafe and restaurant operators have closed down or limited services to delivery and take-away. 
Online retailers and grocery stores are trying to capture rising demand as more Americans are ordered to stay at home to reduce the spread of the outbreak. 
Rival retailer Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc said on Thursday it plans to hire 150,000 hourly associates in the U.S. and announced $550 million in cash bonuses to reward workers. 

The highly contagious coronavirus has infected more than 274,800 people across the world and led to more than 11,300 deaths globally, forcing governments across the world to issue mass lockdowns of people in an attempt to slow the spread of the virus.

CHICAGO (Reuters) - The breathtaking coronavirus-induced plunge of the stock market has unnerved retirement investors of all ages, but it poses special risks for people close to, or already retired. Unlike younger workers with many years ahead of earning and saving, older investors are less able to fall back on income from work and may have less ability to wait out their losses.
How should older investors think about their portfolios now? In one sense, this is the wrong question. A much bigger concern is uncertainty about the resilience of the economy as major sectors grind to a halt as we fight the virus. Still, here are some big-picture thoughts about portfolios from the experts, and some tactical moves to consider.
First, think of the big picture, said Allan Roth, a CFP and head of Wealth Logic in Colorado Springs, Colorado. 
“Markets going down for the last three and a half weeks is statistically rare, but 11 years of a bull market? This is the first time that has happened, so it’s the larger perspective that matters.”
“People are working toward financial independence, and suddenly, the market goes way down in a very fast, shocking manner,” Roth added. “So the natural instinct is not acting out of fear, but to protect what's left - 'I would love to get out of the market now, it would make me feel so much better.' And my logic tells me it's the absolute wrong thing to do.""
And in this moment, it is critical to understand the difference between volatility and risk.
Volatility is what you will always experience from time to time in the stock market. Risk, on the other hand, is about uncertainty, and the fact that we cannot predict the future. And there is risk in any investment.
For example, selling off your portfolio and stuffing your mattress with cash carries the risk that inflation will erode the value of your savings - sharply - over time. If inflation continues at a 2% annual pace, cash will lose half its value over a 25-year period.
REBALANCING
Roth is a big fan of rebalancing your portfolio periodically. This keeps you on track with whatever equity-fixed income allocation you have determined is right for you. But it also can improve returns over time, because it lets you run against the market herd without even thinking about it - when stocks surge, you are selling a bit toward the top of the market; when they drop, you are buying the dip.
Roth calculates that an all-stock portfolio so far this century (through the end of February, using total market index funds, two-thirds U.S. and one-third international) has enjoyed a 4.98% annualized return, while a balanced portfolio (60% stocks, 40% bonds) earned 5.36%.
TARGET ALLOCATIONS 
For retirees, how much of that allocation should go to equities? If you are looking for a proxy on how professional money managers think about that question, look no further than target date funds, which automatically reduce participants’ exposure to stocks as retirement approaches.  Target  (NYSE:TGT) date funds have become dominant favorites in 401(k) plans in recent years, and a growing number of participants are keeping them in retirement, either by staying in their workplace plans or using them in rollover IRAs.
Fidelity Investments' target date series hold 51% equity at the point of retirement - an allocation that the firm decreased by 3.5% two years ago. And last year, it boosted global diversification within the equity portion of its portfolio.
Along with stocks, the funds hold 41% in bonds and 8% in cash equivalents. 
The balance between equities, bonds and cash differs somewhat among the three largest target date fund providers, depending very much on their view of the primary goals for retirees. That reflects a Fidelity view that diversification - including cash - is critical. 
“We think investors at the point of retirement are thinking mainly about the balance of risks that they're likely to experience in the future,” said Andrew Dierdorf, one of Fidelity’s target date fund portfolio managers. “Our goal is to help them maintain their standard of living in retirement.”
That means retired investors will need to achieve returns from equities over the long run, especially since they may well live an additional 20 or 30 years, he notes. But the diminished ability to earn income from work - an income stream that generally behaves like income from bonds would - points to the need for diversification, he adds.
T. Rowe Price has a more aggressive approach. In February, it adjusted the glide path of its retirement funds target date series, with the equities allocation gradually falling to 30% at the end point (30 years after retirement), up from 20% earlier. Investors in this series hold 55% in equities at the initial point of retirement.
The higher equity allocation reflects the saving shortfalls of most investors and rising longevity, notes Wyatt Lee, head of target date strategies for the firm. “We can’t fully invest our way out of a savings problem,” he said. “But by maintaining a reasonable level of growth over the long term, we can continue to help support that income stream - even if it means more short-term volatility.”

""Let's be real. Lattes aren't 'essential',"" Rossann Williams (NYSE:WMB), president of U.S. company-operated and Canada businesses, said in a letter. ""But in times of crisis, the government asks convenient food and beverage outlets to remain open when possible for pickup, Drive Thru, or delivery.""
Exceptions to the closure would be made for cafes serving in or around hospitals and health care centers, she said.
Starbucks, which owns almost all U.S. stores, said its licensed partners would make independent decisions about whether to close their stores, but said it would pay all store partners for the next 30 days, regardless of that decision.
The move ramps up efforts by the world's largest coffee chain to increase social distancing, expanding closures beyond the universities, malls and high risk areas it announced several days ago.
As the virus spreads at a rapid pace across the United States, cafe and restaurant operators have shut their doors or limited services to delivery and take-away.
New York state, Illinois and Connecticut on Friday all followed California in directing residents to stay at home in the most sweeping social distancing measures yet imposed.

830,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 20, 2020 07:40PM ET</span>","Exclusive: Coronavirus, gas slump put brakes on Exxon's giant Mozambique LNG plan","By Helen Reid, Emma Rumney and Stephen Jewkes
JOHANNESBURG/MILAN (Reuters) -  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) is likely to delay the greenlighting of its $30 billion liquefied natural gas (LNG) project in Mozambique as the coronavirus disrupts early works and a depressed gas market makes investors wary, six sources told Reuters.
Top U.S. oil and gas company Exxon said on Tuesday it was evaluating ""significant"" cuts to capital spending and operating expenses. Energy firms worldwide have slashed spending this month as oil prices plummeted to 18-year lows after global travel curbs and reduced economic activity destroyed demand.    
The coronavirus pandemic is forcing delays to projects worldwide. Qatar, the world's largest producer of liquefied natural gas (LNG), is delaying a big expansion in which Exxon is a major partner. 
The Rovuma LNG project, which will produce from a deepwater block off Mozambique containing more than 85 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, was expected to get the go-ahead in the first half of 2020.
But three sources familiar with the project told Reuters that Exxon's partners want to push back a final investment decision (FID). 
A further three sources said the pandemic is disrupting work on the project to such a degree that FID before the second half is unlikely. 
Any delay would leave Exxon's project further behind rival Total, which took FID last June on its neighboring project. 
Exxon might be left with no choice. 
""COVID-19 is affecting guys going into Mozambique, it's affecting Chinese and Korean financiers, and clearly you've had the arse drop out of the oil market,"" said a source with knowledge of the project. 
The pandemic is causing delays to the financing needed for the project, the source added. 
Rovuma LNG is managed by Mozambique Rovuma Venture, a joint venture owned 35.7% each by Exxon and Eni with the remaining stake of 28.6% held by China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC). 
LNG prices hit a record low of $2.7 per million British thermal units (mmBtu) last month, and Rovuma requires an average price of $7 per mmBtu throughout its life to be profitable, according to Bernstein analysts. 
Another source with knowledge of internal discussions said with the energy outlook uncertain and LNG supplies set to rise sharply by 2025, some of the project partners want to ""cool Exxon's heels"" and delay. 
Exxon spokesman Todd Spitler declined to discuss whether partners are seeking to push back the FID. ""This is a complex project that will be developed over several years,"" he said. 
China's CNPC did not respond to Reuters' request for comment and Eni declined to comment. 
Mozambique's state oil firm ENH, Galp Energia and KOGAS, which each have 10% stakes in the project, either did not provide a comment or referred Reuters to Exxon. 
EARLY WORKS HIT 
Exxon has already committed to $500 million in initial investment, and FID is the next stage in funding based on which banks can extend lines of credit. 
But early works are being disrupted by coronavirus travel restrictions. International workers travel regularly to the project site on the Afungi peninsula in Cabo Delgado province, where they live cheek-by-jowl and share a canteen for six- or eight-week stints. 
Many hail from countries that have been hit hard by the coronavirus and have put in place travel restrictions. Mozambique has imposed a 14-day quarantine for those entering the country.
That has left key personnel unable to reach the site. 
""It seems as though they are electing to postpone some of the early stage works and contracts for now,"" another source familiar with the matter said. ""I doubt we can expect their FID before the end of 2020."" 

Exxon's Spitler said employees' health and safety was a priority and declined to comment on the day-to-day details of its operations.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. financial services firms and their staff must be designated as ""essential"" to keep markets functioning as more Americans stay home to mitigate the spread of the coronavirus, a leading financial industry trade group said on Friday. 
""It is imperative that financial services firms and personnel that are critical to maintaining financial market operations and that service institutional and/or retail clients be deemed essential,"" Ken Bentsen, chief executive of the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (SIFMA) wrote in a letter to the country's governors.
The need was especially pressing ""during a time when access to people’s savings and investments are so important,"" he wrote.
New York followed California on Friday in announcing tough measures to combat the fast-spreading virus, requiring all non-essential workers to stay home and all non-essential businesses to close. California has asked nearly 40 million people to stay home under the so-called ""shelter in place"" order.
While businesses like nail salons, tattoo shops and indoor shopping malls must close, banks and related financial institutions are considered essential businesses and exempt from the New York and California closure orders.
Beyond New York, other key financial market components like exchanges, clearing houses, asset managers and supporting data centers, are scattered across the country, including in New Jersey, Atlanta, Chicago, Boston and elsewhere. 
SIFMA has been leading the industry's business continuity efforts, which have seen thousands of traders moved to remote back-up locations and sent to work from home. 

Even so, the group said in the letter addressed to the National Governors Association it was still vital for some personnel to be able to work onsite. Failing to provide an exemption for staff at banks, broker-dealers and asset managers would ""negatively impair market operations,"" the group said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday took  Boeing Co  (N:BA) and some airlines to task for buying back shares with the cash boost from a 2018 tax break, vowing to ensure that companies benefiting from coronavirus stimulus won't follow suit.
Corporations buy back their own shares as a way to invest in themselves. By reducing the number of outstanding shares, a company can boost its stock price, and it is one way corporations add value for shareholders.
Earlier this week, Trump said he did not like share buybacks, when asked by reporters if they would be permitted by a stimulus package being hashed out in Congress to help the American economy recover from the coronavirus. 
The Republican president doubled down on his comments on Friday, when asked by a reporter during a news conference if the buybacks like those by Boeing and some airlines were a ""deal breaker"" for him. 
""I never liked stock buybacks from their standpoint. When we did a big tax cut, and when they took the money and did buybacks, that's not building a hangar, that's not buying aircraft, that is not doing the kind of things that I want them to do,"" he said.
Trump's views on potential buyback restrictions matter because he would need to sign any stimulus package approved by Congress.
Boeing did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act passed by Republican lawmakers in December 2017 - the biggest overhaul of the U.S. tax code in more than 30 years - slashed the corporate income tax rate and charged multinationals a onetime tax on profits held overseas. 
The move prompted major U.S. corporations to bring home cash from abroad and ratchet up share buybacks. However, there was little evidence of companies reinvesting much of that money to expand, one of the goals of the overhaul. 
Trump said on Friday that restrictions were not placed on companies at the time because ""we thought they would have known better but they didn't know better."" 

""I am fine with restricting buybacks,"" Trump added. ""In fact, I would demand that there be no stock buybacks. I don't want them taking hundreds of millions of dollars and buying back their stock because that does nothing,"" he said.

838,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 20, 2020 05:02PM ET</span>",These Five Warning Signs Highlight Virus’s Rapid Economic Impact,"(Bloomberg) -- The economic losses from the coronavirus have transitioned from hints of serious difficulties just a week ago to a devastating stoppage at countless U.S. restaurants, hotels, movie theaters, gyms and other service providers, with millions of employees now idled.
While still largely invisible in the mostly dated official economic data, the destruction is clear in private reports on hotels, dining establishments and theaters, many of which are now closed. The key questions center around how much more deterioration remains and how long it will last.
Here are five indicators that give a sense of the emerging crisis for the nation’s businesses.
1. Hotels
The outlook for the lodging industry has quickly gone from bad to worse. In the week ended March 14, occupancy of U.S. hotels plunged to 53%, meaning rooms were about half empty for the week, according to data tracker STR. A year ago, the rate was 70%. The slump occurred even as the industry reduced prices, with average daily rates falling 11% from a year earlier.
With the virus spreading to all 50 states, the falloff in travel is likely to be just the beginning. Seattle, which was an early epicenter of the virus in the U.S., experienced just 33% occupancy, while San Francisco’s was 39%. New York City, which typically is packed with tourists and business travelers, saw a decline to 49%.
Cities that depend on conventions were especially hard hit, said Jan Freitag, STR’s senior VP of lodging insights. “Group cancellations were felt across the markets.”
2. Retail Sales
Retail sales show a somewhat deceptive picture of true demand as they are holding up primarily because Americans are racing to discount and grocery stores to stockpile food, toilet paper and paper towels and other emergency goods. While discounters saw a surge in sales, purchases slumped at department stores that offer discretionary items like clothing, according to Johnson Redbook data.
Gains were led by “canned food, bottled water, pharmaceuticals, cleaning and household products as consumers stocked up in anticipation of staying at home for the next several weeks,” Bloomberg Intelligence analysts wrote.
It will get even worse for department stores. The largest mall owner, Simon Property Group (NYSE:SPG), announced it was temporarily closing all of its retail malls in the U.S.
3. Jobless Claims
With state and local governments ordering restaurants, movie theaters, bars, gyms and other gathering places to close, economists are bracing for a once-in-a-lifetime surge in jobless claims. Applications for unemployment benefits rose 70,000 last week to 281,000, Labor Department data showed Thursday.
But that’s about to spike much higher. Pantheon Macroeconomics Chief Economist Ian Shepherdson said his preliminary estimate is 2 million claims for next week.  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). economists project 2.25 million.
4. Consumer Comfort
If you are looking for a bright spot, by one measure, consumers’ attitude seem to be holding up reasonably well. The Bloomberg Consumer Comfort Index improved last week to 63 from 62.7 a week earlier, the first gain since January. The caveat is the CCI is reported on a four-week rolling average basis.
Confidence remains well above levels of the past recession during 2007 to 2009. But with layoffs starting to occur in large numbers and the stock market deteriorating rapidly, there is reason to expect sentiment will weaken. Improved household attitudes will be vital for spending when the U.S. emerges from the crisis.
5. Movie Theaters
Theaters in the U.S. and Canada brought in just under $50 million over the weekend starting March 13, researcher Comscore Inc. said Monday. That’s a 61% decline from a year earlier and the smallest weekend tally since at least 1998. The three-largest chains in the U.S. are all closed this week, and almost every new film release has been postponed or is being made available for at-home rental early.
Of course, the cinema isn’t alone within the arts and entertainment industry. Broadway is dark too, having been shut down by order of New York Governor Andrew Cuomo more than a week ago. And all major sports -- remember this should have been a week for NCAA basketball’s March Madness tournament -- have canceled games or suspended seasons indefinitely.

To put this in context, despite all the self-help measures we are taking, we are currently burning roughly $50 million in cash each day,"" it added.
The warning comes as the airline industry has called on the U.S government for financial support at a time when many fear businesses in the sector face extinction amid a plunge in travel demand due to the rapid spread of the coronavirus. 
""We also continue working with the President and Congress on disaster relief assistance, which is vital to protect our industry’s critical role in our nation’s economy. 
""Amid those discussions, in recent days some critics have argued that the airlines have not been good stewards of our money during our profitable years,"" Delta said, but hit back against those claims, highlighting its efforts to shore up its balance sheet. ""We put 50 percent of our operating cash flow back into our business by investing in our people and our customers, use 30 percent to pay down debt, and return 20 percent to our owners."""

In January, the fast-food chain declared a quarterly cash dividend of $1.25 per share of common stock payable on March 16.
McDonald's had raised its dividend by 8% to $1.25 in September, equivalent to $5 annually. The company has raised its dividend for 43 consecutive years since paying its first one in 1976.
Restaurants in the United States have been forced to shut doors or limit to delivery and take-away in efforts to curb the spread of the highly contagious coronavirus, which has taken the lives of over 200 in the country.
McDonald's has already moved to defer rent for its operators and close all dine-in operations.
Peer Starbucks (O:SBUX) has also shifted to a similar delivery model, while others like sandwich chain Subway and fast-casual chain QDOBA have deferred or lowered the royalty fee they collect from operators.
Kempczinski told CNBC the company has not yet seen a breakdown in its supply chain globally and that it would plan for growth in delivery after the crisis.
In China, the epicenter of the virus, McDonald's has reopened 95% of its restaurants, Kempczinski said in the interview.

Investing.com – Wall Street fell on Friday, capping off its worst week since 2008 as investors weighed up global efforts to combat the Covid-19 pandemic that threatens to throw the world economy into a deep recession, with infections now topping a quarter million.
The Dow fell 4.55%, or 913 points, the S&P 500 slumped 4.78% and the Nasdaq Composite fell 3.79%. Both the Dow and S&P suffered their worst week since 2008.
New stimulus measures from President Trump to combat the coronavirus outbreak were overshadowed by a sharp uptick in the number of coronavirus infections across the U.S. and abroad, particularly in Europe, the epicenter of the outbreak.
President Donald Trump said the U.S. and Mexico had agreed to ban all non-essential travel across their border to contain the outbreak.
""As we did with Canada, we're also working with Mexico to implement new rules at our ports of entry to suspend non-essential travel,"" Trump said, according to media reports. The ban, however, would not hinder trade and commerce, the president added. 
Infections have jumped to nearly 270,000 worldwide, with the death toll standing at about 11,266 so far, as Italy reported a record 627 deaths in a single day.
In the U.S., meanwhile, New York and New Jersey joined other states in imposing more restrictions to combat contagion, with governors of both states ordering all workers in non-essential businesses to stay at home.
With the virus increasingly sparking disruptions to daily lives and businesses across the country, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the IRS would delay the national income tax filing day by three months to July 15.
Unprecedented action by global central banks this week, meanwhile, has done little allay investor fears of an impending recession. 
The Federal Reserve on Friday announced a range of liquidity boosting measures, including an expansion of its asset purchasing program beyond just Treasurys and mortgage-backed securities to include municipal bonds to avert a potential liquidity squeeze. The New York Federal Reserve, meanwhile, said it would conduct $1 trillion in overnight repo operations each day for the rest of the month to steady short-term lending markets.  
The sea of red on Wall Street was paced by declines in utilities and consumer staples, which usually serves as a defensive corner of the market, but a slump in Kroger (NYSE:KR), Clorox (NYSE:CLX) and Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) weighed.
Energy, however, was the only sector to end in positive on the day, underpinned by late-session buying, despite a slump in oil prices."

850,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 20, 2020 03:25PM ET</span>","Kraft Heinz talks with Amazon, Walmart daily to speed food deliveries","By Richa Naidu
LONDON (Reuters) - Kraft Heinz (O:KHC) speaks daily with Amazon.com (O:AMZN) and Walmart Inc (N:WMT), hoping to speed up deliveries as customers worldwide stay home and shop online to protect themselves from the COVID-19 pandemic, Kraft Heinz's CEO said on Friday. 
Kraft Heinz, which makes packaged food products from Planters peanuts to Heinz Ketchup, is among several major food companies that has increased production to help retailers respond to panic-buying of staple goods like canned food, toilet paper and cleaning products. 
“Amazon and Walmart and the others have faced a huge increase in demand. I think the bottle-neck is being able to deliver to people’s homes, not production,” Kraft Heinz Chief Executive Miguel Patricio said in an interview on Friday.
""Penetration has increased for them (Amazon), more people are subscribing - it’s big demand and you have to adapt your logistics system to attend this demand."" Patricio said Kraft Heinz was producing “a lot” more for Amazon, but declined to provide specific numbers. 
“They are trying to simplify their portfolio of products and focus on things that are more vital at this moment.”
Kraft Heinz is increasing overall manufacturing and shipping efficiency by cutting production of some items, for instance reducing less popular flavors of a given product. This has freed up enough people for Kraft Heinz to create a third shift in many factories, up from two, Patricio said.
Patricio said sales of Mac & Cheese, Oscar Mayer cold cuts and Planters nuts have increased, and that people are also buying more Heinz vinegar to use as an alternative to cleaning products. 
“We’re breaking production records every day,” Patricio said, adding that a Davenport, Iowa-based Oscar Mayer plant he visited yesterday had increased weekly capacity by 40% compared with the same week last month. According to data firm Nielsen, sales of alternatives to fresh meat were up 206.4% in the week ended March 7 versus the year before. 
President Donald Trump on Sunday held a phone call with more than two dozen U.S. grocery store and supply chain executives, including Patricio. He said Kraft Heinz has now had two discussions with the White House about how to make the food supply chain more agile, and that the company has also held talks with other global leaders.

The company is donating $12 million of food to people in the United States and several countries including Italy, Canada and the United Kingdom.

Investing.com - The Dow continued its selloff on Friday, as energy stocks turned negative after oil prices gave up some of their gains from a day earlier as fears over the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic continue to mount, with the World Health Organisation warning that the outbreak ""isn't just a bad flu season."" 
The Dow fell 2.99%, or 600 points, the S&P 500 slumped 3.26% and the Nasdaq Composite fell 2.22%.
""This is not normal. This isn't just a bad flu season. These are health systems that are collapsing under the pressure of too many cases. This is not normal, this is not just a little bit worse than we're used to,"" Dr. Mike Ryan, executive director of the World Health Organization health emergencies program said, according to media reports. Ryan also said the current testing would need to be scaled up by ""approximately 80 to 100 times.""
The stark warning comes over the spread of the virus, which has infected nearly 270,000 worldwide and killed about 11,266 so far, comes at a time when many concerns over a plunge in travel demand continued to hurt oil prices and forced energy stocks to give up gains, sending the broader market deeper into the red.
Oil settled 10.7% lower, erasing the bulk of its gains from a day earlier, when Crude Oil WTI Futures recorded its biggest one-day percentage gain ever.    
Fears over a virus-led recession, meanwhile, continued to weigh on sentiment despite unprecedented action by global central banks to limit the economic fallout from the Covid-10 pandemic. 
The Federal Reserve on Friday announced a range of liquidity boosting measures, including an expansion of its asset purchasing program beyond just Treasurys and mortgage-backed securities to include municipal bonds to avert a potential liquidity squeeze.

Automakers across the world have announced plans to idle factories as they conduct additional sanitation and cleaning procedures, raising concerns that extended periods of downtime could significantly hit the companies' profits.
The stoppage of work would cut European auto production by over 880,000 units, considering plants are shut for an average of 13 working days in the region, IHS Markit said on Friday.
North America car production is likely to be curtailed by 478,000 units, factoring in an average downtime of six working days, while output in Brazil and Argentina combined would be hit by about 80,000 units, assuming closures between eight and 15 days, the firm said.
""Even if production does only halt for the announced periods of time, the assembly ramp-up phase that follows will cause further impacts,"" said Henner Lehne, vice president, global vehicle group, IHS Markit.

About 89 million light vehicles were produced globally in 2019, according to IHS Markit.

CHICAGO/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. airlines called on Friday for a government stimulus package meant to help them weather the coronavirus crisis by providing payroll protections, warning that around 750,000 jobs depend on the airline industry.
A Republican proposal introduced in the U.S. Senate on Thursday would grant up to $50 billion in secured loans, but bars the cash grants the airlines had requested, spurring intense discussions between airlines, unions and congressional aides over the shape of the aid.
""Loans alone are not sufficient and should be coupled with a worker payroll assistance program and targeted tax relief which will allow airlines to keep operating through this crisis,"" industry body Airlines for America said in a statement.
United Airlines Holdings Inc (O:UAL) and  American Airlines Group  Inc (O:AAL) displayed a united front with their unions, together asking employees to write letters to Congress urging action.
Chicago-based United warned that without sufficient government support by the end of March, it would have to start cutting its payroll to match a 60% schedule reduction planned for April, saying ""time is running out.""
Airlines have already raised capital, suspended share buybacks, cut executive pay, slashed flights and grounded jets to reduce costs and preserve cash during a steep erosion in air travel demand.
Even with those ""self-help measures,"" Delta Air Lines Inc (N:DAL) Chief Executive Ed Bastian said on Friday his airline was burning through $50 million in cash each day. Delta expects its revenue to fall by $10 billion in the second quarter from a year earlier.
U.S. President Donald Trump has said he stands ready to support the industry, but the idea of a bailout has met with a backlash from some critics who argue the airlines should have saved more cash for a rainy day, rather than rewarding shareholders.
""Whatever they ask for will be very controversial,"" said Al Koch, vice chairman of AlixPartners, who was involved in the restructuring of General Motors (NYSE:GM) in 2008-09. ""It's one thing for Trump to say we'll stand behind airlines, and another thing for Congress to enact something into law.""
Meanwhile, union groups continued to lobby for any stimulus package to guarantee protections for frontline employees.
To protect workers, Association of Flight Attendants-CWA President Sara Nelson is pushing for direct payroll subsidies for employees, ranging from wheelchair assistants and gate agents to mechanics and flight attendants.

In a letter to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Minority Leader Chuck Schumer on Friday, a dozen lawmakers said that basic protections for frontline workers, including contractors, were ""a moral obligation,"" but added that airlines should not receive ""a blank check.""

JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South African Airways (SAA) said on Friday it would suspend intercontinental and African regional flights until the end of May because of the coronavirus, as administrators trying to save the airline said it could run out of funds in just over a week.
State-owned SAA has been on the brink of collapse for months and entered a form of bankruptcy protection in December. 
It has not made a profit since 2011 and has received more than 20 billion rand ($1.2 billion) in bailouts in the past three years.
On Friday it said it would suspend flights on its routes to the United States, Britain, Germany, Australia and Brazil until May 31 in response to a government travel ban aimed at stopping the spread of coronavirus. 
SAA said in a later statement that it would suspend flights to African cities including Accra in Ghana, Lusaka in Zambia, Harare in Zimbabwe, Windhoek in Namibia, Lagos in Nigeria and Entebbe in Uganda until the end of May. It said it would continue domestic services to Cape Town.
This is the second wave of mass cancellations this week, after SAA said it would cancel 162 intercontinental and African flights in March and another struggling state-owned airline, SA Express, suspended operations until further notice from Wednesday.
President Cyril Ramaphosa on Sunday announced bans on travel to countries considered ""high-risk"" as regards the coronavirus, including ones to where SAA flies like the United States, Britain and Germany. 
South Africa has recorded more than 200 confirmed coronavirus cases but no deaths so far.[J8N2AI025]
SAA's business rescue team said in a letter to trade unions that measures taken by governments to control the spread of the virus had hurt bookings.
""Unless some urgent and drastic measures are implemented without delay, the situation will deteriorate to such an extent that it will threaten the very likelihood of the company being rescued,"" rescue experts Les Matuson and Siviwe Dongwana wrote in the letter dated March 19.
Matuson and Dongwana said funds secured to sustain rescue efforts could run out by March 31, and asked unions to consider cash-conserving measures like a rotational layoff scheme and short-time arrangement starting within days.
But one of SAA's largest unions, the National Transport Movement (NTM), said talks on Friday on the proposals had failed to reach an agreement. More talks are planned for next week.
NTM president Mashudu Raphetha said the union wanted the government to agree to another bailout and that SAA could save money by eradicating bloated tenders and rooting out corruption. 

On Friday, Matuson and Dongwana also asked creditors for a two-month extension for their rescue plan until May 29.

864,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 20, 2020 02:05PM ET</span>",This is no 2008: Mnuchin borrows from Paulson's economic crisis playbook,"By David Lawder and Andrea Shalal
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has stepped into the breach as the Trump administration's point man to rescue the economy from coronavirus devastation, taking on the role his former Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) boss, Hank Paulson, played over a decade ago.
Mnuchin has closely followed the financial crisis playbook used by Paulson when he led the Treasury Department in 2008, reactivating Federal Reserve credit market backstops and asking Congress for $1 trillion to prop up companies and consumers as the economy grinds to a halt due to the spread of the virus. 
Paulson, responding to a deepening subprime mortgage crisis that caused turmoil in financial markets, sought https://www.reuters.com/article/us-financial-bailout/u-s-launches-all-out-attack-on-credit-crisis-idUSN1945959820080919 $700 billion to buy up toxic mortgage assets. Like Paulson at that time, Mnuchin has warned that inaction would bring dire consequences for the economy.
However, many observers including Paulson acknowledge the current crisis bears little resemblance to the one in 2008.
""Together with the rest of the world we face a formidable economic challenge which is different than any in our history,"" Paulson said in an email to Reuters.
Paulson, who was Goldman Sachs' chairman and chief executive officer before joining then-President George W. Bush's administration in 2006, said he found it ""reassuring"" that Mnuchin had the reins at Treasury and praised his ""deep, hands-on knowledge of financial markets.""
""He has the confidence of congressional leaders on both sides of the aisle,"" said Paulson, who noted that he is in contact with Mnuchin. ""And, very importantly he has the confidence of the President. Now, his ability to deliver results is essential to all Americans of both parties.""
Some economists, investors and foreign officials, however, question whether the 57-year-old former banker and Hollywood film financier can strong-arm executives or influence President Donald Trump to take the drastic steps the unprecedented crisis may demand.
U.S. senators were trying to hammer out a deal on the $1 trillion emergency aid package proposed by Republicans and described by Mnuchin as key to stemming the fallout from an outbreak that has killed at least 200 people, infected more than 12,000 and upended life in the country.
""It's a good first step, but much more will be needed, even with the Fed's recent moves to intervene across private markets,"" said Kenneth Rogoff, a Harvard University economist. 
One key obstacle is the president, critics say. Trump downplayed the initial threat posed by the virus before reversing course after stock markets cratered on fears the global economy was falling off a cliff.
""One can only assume that Mnuchin has to deal with vastly more unpredictability from his boss than Hank Paulson ever did,"" Rogoff said.
SLOW TO ACT
Officials the world over have been slow to grasp the speed and depth of the impact of the outbreak, but the White House's lag has been dramatic. On March 13, Mnuchin was encouraging Americans to fly domestically. Three days later, the country was told to avoid unnecessary travel, and by March 19 the governor of California had ordered his state's nearly 40 million residents to stay at home.
Mnuchin this week predicted the U.S. economy would come ""roaring back"" in the fourth quarter. Rogoff, on the other hand, warned there will be ""staggering economic and social costs"" as the battle against the virus unfolds.
Global coordination, however, is one area in which Mnuchin is not following in Paulson's footsteps, according to diplomatic sources who say the United States has not steered the G7 and G20 nations to take action.
At a meeting of finance leaders from the Group of 20 industrialized nations in February in Riyadh, U.S. Treasury officials pushed back against a stronger statement about the coronavirus outbreak, relegating it to a passing mention as one of several risks to be more closely monitored in the group's communique https://g20.org/en/g20/Documents/Communique%CC%81%20Final%2022-23%20February%202020.pdf, multiple sources familiar with the talks said.
Leaders of the Group of Seven richest nations pledged coordinated action in a call on Tuesday, but the message lacked urgency and rang hollow just days after Trump restricted air travel between the United States and 26 European nations, including G7 members France, Germany and Italy, without prior warning, financial and diplomatic sources said. 
""The G20 and the G7 played a very positive role in the global financial crisis, but we're not seeing that in this case,"" one diplomatic source said.
Mnuchin has also been unable to persuade Trump to remove U.S. tariffs on some $370 billion of imports from China. U.S. manufacturers, retailers and small businesses believe doing so would save them billions.
The Treasury Department did not respond to requests for comment on this story.
'NO TALKING POINTS' 
House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat who spent much of the past 10 days nailing down initial economic rescue bills with Mnuchin and who also negotiated with Paulson in 2008 in the same role, sees both men as ""similarly pragmatic,"" a senior Democratic source told Reuters. ""It’s just the facts. No talking points.""
When Trump at first insisted on a general payroll tax holiday, a provision that Pelosi, Democrats and some Republicans considered a non-starter because it didn't help people who were out of work or would be as a result of the crisis, Mnuchin shifted to a plan to send $1,000 checks directly to Americans, and persuaded the president to go along, the source said. 
Mnuchin's willingness to accept nearly all of the Democrats' demands on an initial bill, including increases to food aid, helped speed up the talks, the source said.
Some were not impressed. Pelosi ""ate Mnuchin's lunch,"" argues Christian Whiton, a senior fellow with the Center for the National Interest, a conservative think tank in Washington.
Bigger fights loom during the next phase, including how hundreds of billions of dollars of aid to larger corporations will be structured. Mnuchin has insisted these will not be ""bailouts,"" but he is taking fire from conservatives here, too. 
""There is no justification for an exercise in profligate spending under the cover of the coronavirus crises,"" researchers at the conservative Heritage Foundation wrote https://www.heritage.org/public-health/report/the-third-inning-next-steps-congress-addressing-the-coronavirus on March 17.
Tony Fratto, who was a White House spokesman during the 2008 financial crisis, credited Mnuchin for a practical, ""non-ideological"" approach and said he is ""actually rising to the occasion."" 

It's the occasion itself that's the problem, he said. ""This really is like an asteroid hitting from outer space.""

The Italian/American maker of Iveco commercial vehicles, farm machinery, construction equipment and powertrains, adds to a long list of European manufacturers closing plants or reducing production rates as the virus spreads.
The decision was driven by disruptions in the group's European supply chain, ""that do not allow for an efficient operation"", Chief Executive Hubertus Muhlhauser said in a statement.
""During these temporary shutdowns, we will also undertake further extensive sanitization and deep cleaning procedures,"" he added.
Friday's announcement follows a decision last week by CNH Industrial to halt operations at four Italian plants.
The group, however, said most its plants producing components would remain operational, though at lower speed, to ensure supply continuity to the group's facilities outside of Europe. European parts logistic hubs and most dealer locations will remain open too.
CNH Industrial currently has 28 plants closed in Europe out of a total of 30, a spokesman said.

CNH Industrial said it was working with unions and works councils to implement the temporary shutdowns and the reopening of the plants. The group is constantly monitoring the situation in all markets in which it operates and will take further measures as required, it added.

“I don’t want to have stock buybacks,” he said Friday at a White House news conference. “I don’t like buybacks. I didn’t like them the first time.”
A bill Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell proposed Thursday would provide billions of dollars of loans to corporations and grants to small businesses.

Investing.com – Wall Street extended its selloff on Friday, as President Donald Trump said the U.S. and Mexico have agreed to ban all non-essential travel across their border as concerns about the coronavirus spread continue to mount.
The Dow fell 1.20%, theS&P 500 fell 1.59% and the Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.85%.
""As we did with Canada, we're also working with Mexico to implement new rules at our ports of entry to suspend non-essential travel,"" Trump said, according to media reports. The ban, however, would not hinder trade and commerce, the president added.
The move comes as efforts nationwide to contain the virus continue, with New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo ordering all workers in non-essential businesses across the state to stay at home.
The move will ""cause disruptions"" and force businesses to close, Cuomo conceded, adding that businesses who fail to comply with the new measure would face penalties.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - AT&T Inc (N:T) withdrew plans to repurchase $4 billion in common stock as it was unable to predict the impact of the coronavirus outbreak on its business, the company said on Friday in a regulatory filing.
Shares of AT&T fell 8% in midday trade.
AT&T said it planned to continue investing in its network and taking care of its employees. 
""The impacts of the pandemic could be material, but due to the evolving nature of this situation, we are not able at this time to estimate the impact on our financial or operational results,"" AT&T said in the filing. 
Washington has sought to stabilize Wall Street with a $1 trillion economic stimulus plan, but some critics think companies should be banned from stock buy backs under the package. 
""If there is so much as a dime of corporate bailout money in the next relief package, it should include a reinstated ban on stock buybacks,"" Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) said in a tweet on Tuesday. 
U.S. President Donald Trump said on Thursday during a press conference that he would not oppose banning stock repurchases under his administration's stimulus plan.
AT&T's accelerated repurchase plan, originally announced on March 3, was set to complete the buy backs in the second quarter. 
Companies like Starbucks (O:SBUX), which announced a 40 million share buyback program on Wednesday, are moving ahead with plans.

The No. 2 U.S. wireless provider announced on Wednesday that it is temporarily closing stores to reduce the spread of the virus and encouraged customers to make purchases online. Earlier this month, AT&T told non-retail employees to work remotely.

879,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 20, 2020 11:35AM ET</span>",Investor Ackman tweets to Trump: Close down the country,"By Svea Herbst-Bayliss
BOSTON (Reuters) - Billionaire investor William Ackman, who has long worried about risks posed by the coronavirus, called on the Trump administration on Wednesday to seal off the country for 30 days and said stocks would ""soar"" if such restrictions were imposed.
""The only answer is to shut down the country for the next 30 days and close the borders,"" Ackman said in a post on Twitter, adding: ""Tell all Americans that you are putting us on an extended Spring Break at home with family.""
Ackman also said he had bought stock in private equity group Blackstone (NYSE:BX) Group as well as portfolio companies his hedge fund Pershing Square (NYSE:SQ) Capital Management already owns, including Hilton Worldwide Holdings.
Ackman, who has some 58,000 Twitter followers but rarely tweets, took to President Donald Trump's preferred communication platform to publicize his plan for proposed action.
After markets closed with fresh losses and the Dow wiped out the last of its gains put on since Trump was inaugurated, Ackman told Reuters shutting down U.S. borders for 30 days was the only way to limit the virus' spread and save industries on the verge of collapse.
""If President Trump were to go on television, with no one standing next to him, and say that he is shutting everything down and tell people to work from home and stay at home for 30 days, this thing could be killed and markets would soar. It might take some time for markets to recover but I'm confident they would recover fully,"" he said.
Ackman, who normally considers himself an optimist, began worrying about the effects of the virus weeks ago and said he began preparing personally and professionally for a pandemic that he estimated could kill between 1% and 2% of the world's population.
""People need to be scared and take this seriously,"" he said, urging the government to essentially force most Americans to stay home for a month.
Without people wandering around outside, the virus' re-infection rate would be killed, he said, adding ""and then you kill the virus ... 30 days would give us a cushion.""
Ackman protected his portfolio with a hedge that helped turn late February losses into gains in early March. Through March 17, however, the Pershing Square Holdings fund lost ground and is now down 6.5% for the year, data from the hedge fund show.
Ackman broadcast his policy prescription in an emotional interview with CNBC on Wednesday and then again on Twitter.
I am sure ""the president will do the right thing in temporarily shutting down the country and closing the borders. If that happens, we can win the war against the virus,"" Ackman tweeted.
The White House responded by saying that Trump has ensured that all Americans would be taken care of, including affected industries and small businesses, CNBC reported.
Ackman is especially concerned about the hotel, airline, restaurant and auto industries, saying they may not have a long lifeline. 
""Hotels rent rooms for a night and if no one comes, they are done,"" he said. He called Hilton a ""canary in the coal mine,"" and warned that without fast action the hotel industry could tumble to zero.
In addition to buying Blackstone stock, Ackman said he had been loading up on the companies already in his portfolio like Lowe's and Restaurant Brands, as well as Hilton. 
Ackman, who runs $6.5 billion investment firm Pershing Square Capital Management from New York, moved his family, including his father who has battled lung cancer, out of the city several weeks ago.
He said he spends a lot of time thinking about so-called black swan events and began worrying about the coronavirus' potentially catastrophic effects on public health and the economy many weeks ago.

Last year, Ackman's publicly traded hedge fund surged 58%, making it one of the industry's best performers. Earlier this year, he sold off a position in Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) before the coffee chain's stock tumbled some 34% amid warnings for people to avoid restaurants, bars, and coffee shops.

""The risk of funds imposing liquidity fees or gates has risen over the last week and will remain elevated based on our expectation that stress in money markets is likely to persist,"" Moody's said in a research report.
Moody's also said heavy withdrawals from U.S. prime money-market funds is putting downward pressure on their net asset values.

Over the last few days, the U.S. prime institutional money market fund segment has lost more than 10% of total portfolio assets. This sharp rise in daily outflow rates has reduced funds’ liquidity levels and placed downward pressure on funds’ net asset values, Moody's said.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets extended a modest recovery in early trading on Friday, as measures earlier in the week by the Federal Reserve and other central banks to unjam financial markets gained more traction.
Earlier, the Federal Reserve said that it would step up offerings of dollars through swap facilities with other central banks. In addition, it said it would accept municipal debt as collateral for funds loaned through its new facility to backstop the money market fund sector, a reflection of the need to backstop lending by lower levels of government that are on the front line of fighting the coronavirus epidemic. 
Government support measures continue to roll out, meanwhile: Senate Republicans introduced a stimulus bill worth $1.2 trillion that includes both direct payments to households and tens of billions in potential aid to businesses
By 11:20 AM ET (1520 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 58 points or 0.3% at 20,145 points. The S&P 500 was down 0.3% and the NASDAQ Composite was up 1.0%. All three indices had opened higher before sliding a little.
Analysts at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) now predict an unprecedented 24% annualized decline in U.S. GDP in the second quarter and an increase in the jobless rate to 9%, as swathes of the U.S. economy shut down to stop the virus spreading.  The analysts expect much of that to be made good in the second half of the year.

Boeing (NYSE:BA) stock rose 7.1% amid ongoing speculation over the conditions that might be applied to any federal aid it receives. Former UN Ambassador Nikki Haley resigned from the company's board, saying that she didn't agree with the company's request for a bailout.
Oil and gas stocks remained under pressure amid skepticism that the U.S. can end the current price war in crude oil, either by regulating domestic output or by diplomatic overtures toward Russia and Saudi Arabia.

890,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 20, 2020 11:05AM ET</span>",Global bank watchdogs in accounting rule talks to limit loan losses,"By Jesús Aguado and Huw Jones
MADRID/LONDON (Reuters) - Global regulators discussed on Friday whether to ease an accounting rule to avoid banks facing huge provisions for loans to companies hit by the coronavirus crisis, a source involved in the talks said.
The Basel Committee of banking regulators from the world's main financial centers later confirmed that it held a teleconference to discuss the impact of the coronavirus outbreak on banks.
""Banks and supervisors must remain vigilant in light of the evolving nature of COVID-19 to ensure that the global banking system remains financially and operationally resilient,"" it said in a statement.
After separate statements from the Bank of England and the European Central Bank on Friday aimed at easing the impact of the accounting rule, Basel made no specific mention of it in its statement, but left the door open to further action.
""In the coming days, the Committee will consider additional measures aimed at supporting the financial resilience of banks... during these unprecedented times,"" it said.
The rule known as IFRS 9 is mandatory in the 27 state European Union, Britain and more 100 other countries.
""Let's agree to kind of freeze the situation,"" the source said of the talks. ""There is greater concern about potential losses that banks may incur in relation to businesses.""
Provisions directly affect a bank's profit and loss calculations and eat into its capital buffers, which would then need topping up in difficult market conditions.
The rule was called for by G20 leaders in the aftermath of the global financial crisis a decade ago. This highlighted how late banks provisioned for souring loans, typically at the point of default, leaving taxpayers to bail out lenders.
Under the International Accounting Standards Board rule, banks have to make some provisioning for expected losses on the first day of the loan. The United States, which has its own standard setter, insists on full provisioning from the start.
The Bank of England, a Basel Committee member, sought on Friday to clarify the application of IFRS 9 during the coronavirus epidemic, saying that its rapid onset meant it was very challenging to make forecasts about expected losses.
If any forecasts are made, they should reflect the temporary nature of the shock and fully take into account the relief measures that Britain's government has taken to help the economy, such as payment holidays for mortgages.
The European Central Bank, also a Basel member, told banks on Friday not to provision too much against souring loans to avoid being pro-cyclical, meaning accentuating market stresses.
""Within its prudential remit, the ECB recommends that all banks avoid procyclical assumptions in their models to determine provisions,"" the ECB said.
Banks should make use of the transitional rules that were introduced to phase-in IFRS, it added.

Merz, who swapped her chairman role for CEO after the resignation of former boss Guido Kerkhoff last year, was originally meant to stay in the job until the end of September.
The supervisory board's personnel committee on Friday recommended appointing Merz for a three-year term starting on April 1, 2020. Her delegation from the steering committee would end as a result.
""This is the best conceivable solution for the company. Martina Merz has proven that her approach is the right one and that her consistency is effective,"" Chairman Siegfried Russwurm said.
""The changes in the company are clearly visible. We want her to continue with the same vigor.""
The appointment gives Merz tailwind to move ahead with the restructuring of the group, the first major step of which was achieved last month through the sale of its elevator unit to a consortium led by Advent and Cinven.
Further steps are likely to include painful job cuts and additional asset sales. Merz will assume responsibility for Plant Technology, a division for which Thyssenkrupp has started a disposal process, the company said.

Chief Financial Officer Johannes Dietsch will resign effective March 31 and be replaced by Klaus Keysberg, already a member of the management board and in charge of the steel and materials trading business units.

O'Leary said that he and the rest of the airline’s employees will take a 50% pay cut for the months of April and May, the newspaper reported. 
He said he was working on a best-case scenario of two-three months in which flights would be grounded and revenues would vanish, but said ""honestly none of us have any idea.""
""The priority here for us as a company is how do we preserve as much cash so that if we have to operate for three, six, nine, maybe even 12 months, with no flights and no revenues how do we survive that, do we have the cash to survive that and we believe we do,"" O'Leary was quoted as saying.
Ryanair had cash and cash equivalents of over 4 billion euros as of March 12, the newspaper quoted O'Leary as saying. 
In addition, the group has undrawn credit lines and nearly 300 aircraft that it owns with a current value of about $8-$10 billion, Mr O’Leary was quoted as saying, adding that he did not expect the airline to have to draw on the credit lines for the moment.

""Keeping all U.S. financial markets open is essential to the well-being of the general economy and vital to maintaining and bolstering investor confidence, particularly once the economy recovers from the effects of this pandemic,"" the statement said.

Top NYSE officials have said the Big Board will continue to work under normal hours electronically despite shutting its trading floor, where dealers operate shoulder-to-shoulder and risk infection from coronavirus.

920,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 20, 2020 09:15AM ET</span>","Already retired, or close to it? How to think about volatility in perilous times","By Mark Miller
CHICAGO (Reuters) - The breathtaking coronavirus-induced plunge of the stock market has unnerved retirement investors of all ages, but it poses special risks for people close to, or already retired. Unlike younger workers with many years ahead of earning and saving, older investors are less able to fall back on income from work and may have less ability to wait out their losses.
How should older investors think about their portfolios now? In one sense, this is the wrong question. A much bigger concern is uncertainty about the resilience of the economy as major sectors grind to a halt as we fight the virus. Still, here are some big-picture thoughts about portfolios from the experts, and some tactical moves to consider.
First, think of the big picture, said Allan Roth, a CFP and head of Wealth Logic in Colorado Springs, Colorado. 
“Markets going down for the last three and a half weeks is statistically rare, but 11 years of a bull market? This is the first time that has happened, so it’s the larger perspective that matters.”
“People are working toward financial independence, and suddenly, the market goes way down in a very fast, shocking manner,” Roth added. “So the natural instinct is not acting out of fear, but to protect what's left - 'I would love to get out of the market now, it would make me feel so much better.' And my logic tells me it's the absolute wrong thing to do.""
And in this moment, it is critical to understand the difference between volatility and risk.
Volatility is what you will always experience from time to time in the stock market. Risk, on the other hand, is about uncertainty, and the fact that we cannot predict the future. And there is risk in any investment.
For example, selling off your portfolio and stuffing your mattress with cash carries the risk that inflation will erode the value of your savings - sharply - over time. If inflation continues at a 2% annual pace, cash will lose half its value over a 25-year period.
REBALANCING
Roth is a big fan of rebalancing your portfolio periodically. This keeps you on track with whatever equity-fixed income allocation you have determined is right for you. But it also can improve returns over time, because it lets you run against the market herd without even thinking about it - when stocks surge, you are selling a bit toward the top of the market; when they drop, you are buying the dip.
Roth calculates that an all-stock portfolio so far this century (through the end of February, using total market index funds, two-thirds U.S. and one-third international) has enjoyed a 4.98% annualized return, while a balanced portfolio (60% stocks, 40% bonds) earned 5.36%.
TARGET ALLOCATIONS 
For retirees, how much of that allocation should go to equities? If you are looking for a proxy on how professional money managers think about that question, look no further than target date funds, which automatically reduce participants’ exposure to stocks as retirement approaches.  Target  (NYSE:TGT) date funds have become dominant favorites in 401(k) plans in recent years, and a growing number of participants are keeping them in retirement, either by staying in their workplace plans or using them in rollover IRAs.
Fidelity Investments' target date series hold 51% equity at the point of retirement - an allocation that the firm decreased by 3.5% two years ago. And last year, it boosted global diversification within the equity portion of its portfolio.
Along with stocks, the funds hold 41% in bonds and 8% in cash equivalents. 
The balance between equities, bonds and cash differs somewhat among the three largest target date fund providers, depending very much on their view of the primary goals for retirees. That reflects a Fidelity view that diversification - including cash - is critical. 
“We think investors at the point of retirement are thinking mainly about the balance of risks that they're likely to experience in the future,” said Andrew Dierdorf, one of Fidelity’s target date fund portfolio managers. “Our goal is to help them maintain their standard of living in retirement.”
That means retired investors will need to achieve returns from equities over the long run, especially since they may well live an additional 20 or 30 years, he notes. But the diminished ability to earn income from work - an income stream that generally behaves like income from bonds would - points to the need for diversification, he adds.
T. Rowe Price has a more aggressive approach. In February, it adjusted the glide path of its retirement funds target date series, with the equities allocation gradually falling to 30% at the end point (30 years after retirement), up from 20% earlier. Investors in this series hold 55% in equities at the initial point of retirement.
The higher equity allocation reflects the saving shortfalls of most investors and rising longevity, notes Wyatt Lee, head of target date strategies for the firm. “We can’t fully invest our way out of a savings problem,” he said. “But by maintaining a reasonable level of growth over the long term, we can continue to help support that income stream - even if it means more short-term volatility.”

The company, which runs Wall Street's Dow Jones (DJI) and S&P 500 (SPX) indexes, said the only comparison for the past month's sell-off on equity and other markets historically was the 2008 financial crash.
All the main U.S. stock indexes have lost nearly 30% since hitting record highs last month, with the benchmark S&P 500 off more than $8 trillion in value.
Analysts at S&P Global noted that over 7,500 trading days dating back to January 1990, five of the eight highest closing levels for CBOE's volatility index (VIX), known as Wall Street's fear gauge, occurred in the past week.
""Only the peaks in volatility that occurred during the 2008 financial crisis saw anything similar,"" said Tim Edwards, managing director of index investment strategy at S&P Global.

""Over its long history, the S&P 500 has moved a little under 1% each day, on average. With VIX currently standing at four times its long-term average of 20, daily moves in the S&P 500 of around 4% are implied for the next month.""

LONDON (Reuters) - Regulators should use the flexibility built into financial rules to help banks keep funds flowing to the economy during the coronavirus epidemic, the Financial Stability Board said on Friday.
The FSB coordinates financial rules for the Group of 20 Economies (G20) and said the global financial system was in better shape to cope with market stress caused by coronavirus than it was in the financial crisis a decade ago.
The board, made up of regulators, central banks and treasury officials from G20 nations, have pushed through a welter of tougher rules since that crisis, in particular much higher bank capital requirements.
""The FSB encourages authorities and financial institutions to make use of the flexibility within existing international standards to provide continued access to funding for market participants and for businesses and households facing temporary difficulties from COVID-19,"" the FSB said in a statement.
The FSB said it was actively cooperating to maintain financial stability during market stress.
""Many members of the FSB have already taken action to release available capital and liquidity buffers, in addition to actions to support market functioning and accommodate business continuity plans,"" it added.

LONDON (Reuters) - The European Union's markets watchdog has told stock and bond traders working offsite because the coronavirus has shut their trading floors to take notes if they can't record telephone conversations with customers.
Under EU law, traders must record calls when trading. But banks have shut down their main trading floors, forcing dealers to work from back-up sites or even from home, where some may not be equipped to record calls.
Banks have complained they have been left largely in the dark by regulators over how to deal with such situations without falling foul of an EU securities law known as MiFID II.
""ESMA reminds firms of the MiFID II requirements in this area,"" the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) said in a statement on Friday.
""ESMA also recognizes that, considering the exceptional circumstances created by the COVID-19 outbreak, some scenarios may emerge where, notwithstanding steps taken by the firm, the recording of relevant conversations required by MiFID II may not be practicable.""
This could be due to the sudden remote working by a significant part of staff, or the lack of access by clients to electronic communication tools, ESMA said.
If traders can't record calls then they could use written minutes or notes of telephone conversations when providing services to clients after telling customers there would be no recording and that notes would be taken, ESMA said.

""In these scenarios, firms should also ensure enhanced monitoring and ex-post review of relevant orders and transactions,"" the watchdog added.

925,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 20, 2020 08:18AM ET</span>",‘Illiquidity Doom Loop’ Threatens Bond ETFs Caught Up in Turmoil,"(Bloomberg) -- The rout in European bonds has set in motion what could become an “illiquidity doom loop” in the region’s investment-grade debt ETFs, Mizuho International Plc​​​​​​ warns.
While this month’s sell-off has inflicted only minor stress on most exchange-traded products, some have seen extreme gaps form between the price and the value of assets, signifying disorder in the underlying markets. That has reignited anxiety about fixed-income ETFs, which are more liquid than the assets they hold.
So far, ETFs have largely withstood one of the toughest liquidity tests they’ve ever faced, but Mizuho’s Peter Chatwell sees the beginning stages of the spiral taking place in funds such as the 10.2 billion euro ($11 billion) iShares Core EUR Corp Bond UCITS ETF, ticker IEAC. The ETF’s price traded at a record 6.5% discount to its net-asset value this week.
Rampant volatility in bond markets makes it unappealing for middlemen known as authorized participants to step in to equalize the value of the ETF and the bonds underlying it. In normal times, the price dislocation would spur them to buy shares of a falling ETF in order to exchange them for the underlying bonds with the fund’s issuer, capturing a virtually risk-free profit.
Now, with stress mounting, fears are rising that investors rushing to redeem ETFs will exacerbate a sell-off in the underlying market as authorized participants channel bonds out of the fund. The rampant volatility has made it more difficult to unload the underlying bonds.
Chatwell warns the price dislocation may cause investors to abandon the ETFs, and argues that the region’s central bank should purchase European high-grade ETFs in addition to corporate bonds in order to reduce selling pressure on the underlying bonds.
“ETF investors may lose faith in the ETF products, and sell even more, unless policy makers take action to break the loop,” wrote Chatwell, Mizuho’s head of multi-asset strategy, in a note Thursday. “Given the importance of corporate bond spreads in the transmission of ECB monetary policy to the real economy, we think the ECB should also consider measures to address this problem.”
Concerns about the economic fallout of the coronavirus have upended financial markets, unleashing historical turbulence across the bond spectrum and sapping liquidity.
While many strategists have long argued that such turmoil will cause ETFs to exacerbate the selling, so far the evidence for a liquidity spiral is scant, even as some of the largest fixed-income ETFs continue to trade at steep discounts. IEAC’s discount narrowed to 2.9% in the latest session.
In the eyes of Dave Perlman at UBS Global Wealth Management, ETFs actually diminish the risk of such a doom loop.
“The ETF provides a mechanism for sellers and buyers to meet without selling the underlying bonds,” said Perlman, an ETF strategist. “The ETF wrapper helps slow the risk of the death spiral.”"

Shanghai also held an online opening ceremony for local branches of five global institutions including JPMorgan, Invesco and Russell Investment.
""In such a special situation where the city is making all efforts to combat the coronavirus, the ceremony shows the world Shanghai's determination to further open its financial industry,"" the Shanghai Municipal Office of Finance Service said in a statement. 
It also shows global financial institutions have confidence in Shanghai, it said.
As the virus spreads globally, Shanghai has stepped up screening of inbound travellers to prevent them importing new cases, raising concerns the pace of China's financial liberalisation could be slowed. 
As part of the interim Sino-U.S. trade deal signed last year, China will scrap foreign ownership caps in the mutual fund and brokerage industries on April 1. 
The Shanghai government said foreign financial institutions are actively preparing to run wholly-owned businesses in Shanghai.
Global asset managers, including BlackRock (N:BLK), Fidelity International, Neuberger Berman and  Schroders  (L:SDR) plan to set up mutual fund units in Shanghai and will submit applications once rules allow, the statement said. 
In the brokerage sector, the Singaporean bank DBS (SI:DBSM) has applied to set up a majority-owned securities venture in the city, while  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS) plans to raise its stake in its Chinese brokerage venture to 51% from 49% now. 
In addition, several financial institutions plan to set up wholly-owned brokerage units in Shanghai as soon as ownership restrictions are scrapped.
""China represents one of the largest opportunities for many of our clients and is a critical component of JPMorgan's growth plans in Asia Pacific, and globally,"" Filippo Gori, CEO for JPMorgan, Asia Pacific, said in a separate statement announcing the opening of its majority-owned Chinese brokerage venture.

Other foreign businesses that open on Friday include the Shanghai units of Korean Reinsurance Co, Invesco, Russell Investment and Greenlight Capital.

927,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 20, 2020 07:10AM ET</span>",Wall Street weekahead: Coronavirus uncertainty muddies views on buying opportunities for plunging stocks,"By Lewis Krauskopf
NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stock valuations are tumbling in the wake of the coronavirus-fueled market rout, but determining when equities are cheap enough to buy is a tricky proposition.
The S&P 500's (SPX) price-to-earnings ratio, based on earnings estimates for the next year, has dropped from over 19 in late February to 14.2 as of Wednesday, according to Refinitiv data. 
The decline in forward P/E marks a drop from the highest level since about mid-2002 to a level below the index's historic average.
But the numbers may be misleading. For example, many market watchers say overall earnings estimates have yet to adjust low enough to account for the economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic. That adjustment would mean stocks, based on price-to-earnings valuations, are less attractive than they appear.
“It’s a little bit difficult to look at the P/E even for this year. The estimates are going to come down; they are still too high,"" said James Ragan, director of wealth management research at D.A. Davidson. ""It’s just so hard to even figure out what the impact is going to be.""
Consensus earnings estimates for 2020 are for S&P 500 companies' earnings to rise by 2.7%,  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) analysts said in a note on Wednesday. That number falls to a decline of 0.7% for this year when only estimates updated in the prior seven days were used, Credit Suisse found, noting that ""while we believe estimates will fall further, 'fresh' numbers better reflect current realities.""
BofA Global Research on Thursday cut its S&P 500 forecast so that it now projects earnings to fall 15% this year.
Companies may begin to shed some light on the economic damage when they start reporting first-quarter results in the middle of April. 
""We have no idea where earnings are going at all,"" said Lindsey Bell, chief investment strategist at Ally Invest. ""We are probably not even going to get clarity on it until maybe Q1 reporting season ... and even then I wouldn’t be surprised to see a lot of companies just pull guidance.""
(Graphic: Sinking stock valuations, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/USA-STOCKS/0H001R8HLCF2/eikon.png) 
Already this week, FedEx (N:FDX) and Marriott (O:MAR) walked away from their 2020 forecasts because of the uncertainty from the coronavirus, which has infected over 210,000 people globally and killed 8,900.
The S&P 500 has fallen 28.8% since its all-time record high close on Feb 19 and hit its lowest level this week since early 2017. 
While price-to-earnings valuations are a moving target, the extent of the drop has enticed investors seeking a potential bargain, particularly those who can hold stocks for a long time.
For example, Brad McMillan, chief investment officer for Commonwealth Financial Network, pointed to the number of stocks with a heftier dividend than the yield on the U.S. 10-year Treasury note.
“I am not buying right now, but right now there is a powerful economic argument for buying stocks,” McMillan said. 
“We are getting to the point where stocks are already compelling economically even if the emotional context may still take them down further.”
Even as he braces for a decline in earnings in this year, Ragan said there is a ""pretty strong chance"" of earnings growth in 2021.
“For a long-term investor who is trying to have some confidence about investing now or hanging in there now, you can see light at the end of the tunnel from a valuation standpoint once you start to look to 2021,” Ragan said.
The S&P 500's tumble extended to over 32% earlier this week. Investing in stocks at a 30% level of decline in the last two bear markets, during the 2000 dot-com bubble and 2008 financial crisis, ""was a pretty good buying opportunity,"" Bell said.
For investors with at least a five-year investment horizon, now is a ""prudent time to start putting money to work,"" said Bell, who said technology stocks appear particularly enticing.

""Expect that you might see it go down near-term but over the long term you will be rewarded,"" Bell said.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are set to open higher Friday, as investors seemingly put their faith in the vast array of stimulus policies from central banks and governments to shore up economies against the coronavirus pandemic.
At 6:55 AM ET (1055 GMT), futures for the S&P 500 traded 72 points, or 3%, higher, futures for the Nasdaq up 309 points, or 4.2%, while theDow Jones futures contract rose 673 points, or 3.4%. 
The Federal Reserve extended dollar swap lines with central banks late Thursday, while Senate Republicans introduced a stimulus and rescue proposal that could total $1.2 trillion.
Earlier Friday, the Bank of England suspended 2020 stress tests for the eight major U.K. banks and building societies, a day after cutting interest rates for the second time in a week. 
Additionally, Germany is set to introduce a half-trillion euro fund to support companies thrown into payments difficulties by the coronavirus crisis, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
That said, the extent of the economic slowdown due to the virus outbreak was put into sharp focus as California, the most populous U.S. state, issued a ""stay at home"" order to residents.
Governor Gavin Newsom told Californians late Thursday they should only leave their homes when necessary during the pandemic. He earlier estimated more than half of the 40 million people in his state would contract Covid-19 in just the next two months.
Still, adding to the positive tone was a jump in oil prices on the back of a report by The Wall Street Journal alleging that the U.S. may impose production quotas on domestic companies. In addition, President Trump suggested he may intervene in the price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia at an ""appropriate time"".
U.S. crude and Brent have both collapsed about 40% in the last two weeks since talks between the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, including Russia, broke down, resulting in Saudi Arabia ramping up supply. 
This has hurt many U.S. producers, most of which have budgeted for oil between $55 per barrel and $65 per barrel in 2020.
At 06:55 AM ET (1055 GMT), U.S. crude futures traded 5,2% higher at $27.25 a barrel, after soaring 24% Thursday. The international benchmark Brent contract rose 4.5% to $29.74, after jumping 14.4% on Thursday in its biggest one-day gain since September.
Gold futures rose 2.3% to $1,513.90/oz, while EUR/USD traded at $1.0739, up 0.4%."

The virus, which has claimed over 10,000 lives globally, has roiled global markets and forced miners such as  Rio Tinto  (LON:RIO) and Teck Resources to reduce activity as governments limit the movement of their populations. 
""At certain operations, such as those in Chile, we are taking measures to temporarily reschedule operational work in order to help reduce the density of people on site and with it to reduce the probability of the virus spreading,"" Anglo said in a statement. 
The global miner, which produces copper in Chile, said its supply chains were functioning well at the moment as a result of engagement with suppliers. 
Anglo said on Thursday it would reduce operations at its Los Bronces copper mine in Chile and said production losses would be minimal.

Employees in logistics, central services and manufacturing operations would not be affected, a company official who declined to be named said on Friday. Inditex's headquarters in Arteixo, northern Spain, are the nerve center of the fashion group's operations.
Most of the company's administration staff are working from home while logistics employees are working fewer to a shift so that safety recommendations of keeping a distance between workers can be observed, the official added.
Spain declared a nationwide 15-day state of emergency to fight the coronavirus on Saturday, ordering bars, restaurants and most shops to close, as well as restricting transport.
Inditex's stores in the country, including its flagship Zara chain, have been closed since then, although it has continued to pay their employees' salaries.

""Due to the drastic decline in net sales and revenues, Vapiano is now in a state of insolvency, specifically a cash flow insolvency,"" the restaurant chain said in a regulatory statement. 
Under German insolvency law, management has three weeks to evaluate whether full insolvency proceedings can still be averted.
""Vapiano will apply at short notice for support under the financial assistance programs announced by various governments in Europe,"" it said. 

Vapiano said it will pursue insolvency if such efforts to secure financial support fail since it generates almost no turnover, while salaries, rents and operating costs continue to accrue. It expects a decline in sales of over 20%, and a fall in operating and net profit in the first and second quarters of 2020, it said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Airlines hit hard by the travel restrictions imposed as a result of the coronavirus pandemic may soon present buying opportunities for investors, the co-founder of the buyout firm that owns budget carrier Frontier Airlines said in an interview.
The NYSE Arca Airline Index has lost two-thirds of its value in the past four weeks, more than double the 30% drop in the S&P 500 Index, as investors fret about the impact of airlines grounding flights and placing thousands of workers on unpaid leave as air travel is sharply curtailed across the globe to try to stem the coronavirus outbreak.
""My personal point of view is that they're going to be some really good buys on publicly traded shares of airlines in Europe and the U.S.,"" Bill Franke, managing member of private equity firm Indigo Partners LLC, said in the interview this week.
""Inevitably, airlines will come back as the economy revives and as the coronavirus issue abates.""
Franke is not the first investor to spot bargains in the airline sector. Warren Buffett's  Berkshire Hathaway Inc  (N:BRKa) increased its stake in Delta Airlines Inc (N:DAL) by $45 million earlier this month as its shares slumped, bringing its stake to 11%. Berkshire was already Delta's top shareholder.
Berkshire also owns similar-sized stakes in  American Airlines Group  Inc (O:AAL), United Airlines Holdings Inc (O:UAL), and Southwest Airlines Co (N:LUV). 
Indigo Partners also owns major stakes in Santiago, Chile-based JetSmart and Hungarian Wizz Air Holdings Plc (L:WIZZ). Franke said the industry ""desperately needs"" some form of government support and that he was confident a deal would be reached.
While U.S. President Donald Trump's administration has discussed the possibility of providing financial aid to the airlines, it has so far resisted offering grants, as the industry would like. 
A Republican proposal introduced in the U.S. Senate on Thursday would grant up to $58 billion in secured loans to help passenger and cargo airlines hit by the coronavirus crisis, but would bar cash grants and could result in the government getting equity stakes.

Indigo has spent the past few weeks shoring up the balance sheets of the airlines in its portfolio to make sure they have enough cash, Franke said.""We talk on a daily basis about where's your cash. What can we do to reduce operating costs? How can we build cash?” Franke said. ""You have to plan for the worst or most extreme outcome.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street wrapped up its worst week since October 2008, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 sliding more than 4% on Friday as tough restrictions imposed by New York and California to try to limit the spread of the coronavirus fueled worries about damage to the U.S. economy. 
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo early on Friday ordered all non-essential workers to stay home. It followed on the heels of California's statewide ""stay at home"" order issued late Thursday.
The moves by two of the most populous U.S. states affects some 40 million people. Also, federal authorities this week moved to close the borders with Canada and Mexico, with more than 12,000 cases having been confirmed in the United States as of Friday. 
""The equity markets are still trying to get a handle on how bad the economy is going to be, and I think news of entire states being closed probably qualifies as incrementally negative,"" said Willie Delwiche, investment strategist at Robert W. Baird in Milwaukee. 
It affects ""a lot of economic activity and a lot of businesses,"" Delwiche said.
In early trade, the market briefly attempted to build on Thursday's gains as global policymakers turned on the taps to prop up financial markets reeling from weeks of heavy selling that ended Wall Street's record 11-year bull run.
Coronavirus fears have wiped off almost 32%, or roughly $9 trillion, from the value of the benchmark S&P index since its record closing high on Feb. 19.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) fell 913.21 points, or 4.55%, to 19,173.98, the S&P 500 (SPX) lost 104.47 points, or 4.34%, to 2,304.92 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) dropped 271.06 points, or 3.79%, to 6,879.52.
Friday's drop left the Dow down 3% from when President Trump took office in January 2017.
All three major indexes registered their biggest weekly declines since October 2008, although the Cboe Volatility index (VIX) - Wall Street's fear gauge - ended the day down at 66.04, in what some investors saw as a sign that selling may subside.
Investors are now counting on further stimulus over the next few days, as the U.S. Senate mulls a $1 trillion package that would include direct financial help for Americans.
""The bottom line here is the market is clearly actively anticipating the fiscal stimulus plan. It's almost like we're going to continue to be in these volatile swings until we get a little more clarity on how large that plan is,"" said Ryan Detrick, senior market strategist at LPL Financial in Charlotte, North Carolina.
A Reuters poll of economists suggested the global economy was already in recession, while analysts at U.S. stock market index operator S&P Global said volatility across geographies and asset classes was at record highs.
""Quadruple witching"" added to choppy trading on Friday, with investors unwinding positions in futures and options contracts before their expiration.
AT&T Inc (N:T) tumbled 8.7% as the wireless carrier said the outbreak might have a material impact on financial results and canceled a $4 billion share repurchase agreement.
The airlines sector <.SPCOMAIR> rose 2.4% after losing more than half its value since late February.
S&P 500 utilities (SPLRCU) fell 8.2% on the day, leading sector declines.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.27-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.55-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
The S&P 500 posted no new 52-week highs and 94 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 5 new highs and 257 new lows.

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 18.56 billion shares, compared to the 15.5 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

Investing.com - European stock markets surged higher Friday, helped by strong gains in the energy sector after oil prices bounced back.
At 03:55 ET (0855 GMT), the U.K.'s FTSE index was trading 2.3% higher, France's CAC 40 and the DAX were up 4.8%. The pan-eurozone index, the Euro Stoxx 50, gained 4.5%. 
Additionally, U.S. crude futures traded 6.6% higher at $27.62 a barrel, after soaring 24% Thursday. The international benchmark Brent contract rose 5.8% to $30.12, after jumping 14.4% on Thursday in its biggest one-day gain since September.
This has prompted healthy gains in the oil & gas sector, a part of the market which has been hit hard by the slump in crude prices.
Shares in U.K. oil giant  BP  (LON:BP) were up 7.6%, shares in Anglo-Dutch producer Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) gained 7%,  Total  (PA:TOTF) in France was up 7.6% and Repsol (MC:REP) (MC:REP) in Spain 5.5%.
These moves followed U.S. President Donald Trump suggesting he may intervene in the price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia at an ""appropriate time"".
U.S. crude and Brent have both collapsed about 40% in the last two weeks since talks between the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, including Russia, broke down, resulting in Saudi Arabia ramping up supply.
Yet, while market participants take stock of the many and varied plans to stimulate the global economy given the destruction wrought by the coronavirus pandemic,  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) gave a timely reminder that times remain difficult.
The German bank warned Friday that the impact of the coronavirus outbreak may affect its ability to meet its financial targets. This is the first time that Germany's largest lender has sounded the alarm on the outbreak. 
Also in Germany, Siemens confirmed that it had 57 confirmed cases of Covid-19 among its workforce.
Economic indicators are thin on the ground in Europe Thursday, although the release of the Bank of England’s Quarterly Bulletin, at 8:00 AM ET (1200 GMT), may be of interest given the central bank’s surprise interest rate cut Thursday.
Elsewhere, at 4:45 AM ET (0845 GMT), gold futures were up 2% to $1,509.05/oz, while EUR/USD traded at 1.0786, up 0.9% on the day.

(Reuters) - European shares jumped for a second straight session on Friday, as a wave of fiscal and monetary stimulus tempted investors back into equity markets after days of selling on signs the world was headed into a deep, coronavirus-driven recession.
The European Commission said on Friday it was looking at loosening debt rules for member states and issuing common euro zone bonds in an attempt to shore up businesses and households crushed by the meltdown in economic activity.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index (STOXX) was up 4.3%, on course to erase the entire week's declines, but still looking at its worst month in three decades as the deepening spread of the outbreak in Europe forces countries to shut down.
Financials (SX7P) rose 3.9% from a near 30-year low, with Allianz SE (DE:ALVG),  Prudential  Plc (L:PRU),  ING Groep  (AS:INGA) and Zurich Insurance Group (S:ZURN) surging between 8.5% and 12.0%.
Even travel and leisure stocks (SXTP) attempted a rebound in what has been their worst month so far since October 1987, as the promise of more stimulus raised hopes of a smoother recovery from the health crisis.
The optimism was reflected across global equity markets, as the U.S. Senate debated a $1 trillion-plus package that would include direct financial help for Americans. Meanwhile, sources told Reuters that China was set to unleash trillions of yuan of fiscal stimulus.
""It's seemingly having a positive effect given the market needed a trillion-dollar worth of help this week to just make it to the weekend,"" said Stephen Innes, a markets strategist at AxiCorp.
""(But it is) the calm before the storm, I'm afraid, as the nasty impact on corporate solvency will become more evident in the weeks ahead when the demand shock filters through to the real economy.""
Several blue-chip European firms have flagged a severe hit to business as the pandemic empties hotels and crushes consumer spending, with the airline industry facing a complete collapse in the face of halt in global travel. 
British retailer Marks & Spencer (L:MKS) was the latest to warn about an impact in its clothing, homewares and international businesses, sending its shares down 5.2%.
Holiday Inn owner IHG (L:IHG) said demand for hotels was currently at the lowest levels it had ever seen and announced a series of measures to cut costs. But its shares, which had lost half their value since the virus emerged in Europe mid-February, were up 12.5% in early Friday trading.

Italian shares (FTMIB) lagged other major stock markets as the death toll from COVID-19 in the country overtook that of China, the former epicenter of the virus outbreak.

941,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 20, 2020 04:29AM ET</span>",Italy Set To Tighten Its Lockdown as Fatalities Top China,"(Bloomberg) -- Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte’s government is set to reinforce and extend the near-total lockdown on Italy as it struggles to combat the spread of coronavirus, after overtaking China as the country with the highest recorded death.
Conte is weighing extending the ban on non-essential activities until at least May 1, daily La Stampa reported on Friday, and the government may call in the army to help enforce restrictions, other Italian newspapers said. Soldiers have already been deployed in the southern regions of Sicily and Calabria.
Italy on Thursday surpassed China as the country with the highest recorded death toll from the coronavirus, with the pandemic also gathering pace in Spain and France as European governments struggle to keep up in their responses to tackle the spread of the disease. The number of Italian fatalities reached 3,405, civil protection officials said.
Officials in the north of the country have been calling on Conte to get tougher in extending and enforcing the lockdown, even at the risk of further straining the economy in the area that accounts for the lion’s share of Italy’s gross domestic product. The Lombardy region around Milan could move to further restrict the types of businesses allowed to operate, Stampa reported. Outdoors activities will also be likely banned.
Schools and universities may not reopen this academic year, Italian media reported. The school session, which was set to restart April 3., would still be considered complete, with students graduating and moving on to the next year as normal. The 41,035 total Italian cases of the virus so far include 4,440 who have recovered from the illness.
Ministers and policy makers across the continent again ramped up their efforts to counter the outbreak and mitigate the devastating effects on societies and economies with millions of people forced to stay home.
The U.K. and Greece were among those announcing new financial action while France urged workers to maintain food supplies. Leaders made it more apparent they don’t expect the fight against Covid-19 to end soon even as new cases have slowed to a trickle in China, the original epicenter.
Macron’s Message
The death toll, though, rose more rapidly elsewhere. In Spain, the number shot up 28% to 767, while France reported a 41% increase to 372. French President Emmanuel Macron said it was unclear how many virus waves the world could be facing, and that efforts to arrest the outbreak will likely be implemented again in future.
In the meantime, he urged people to strike a balance between staying home and keeping the country running as the coronavirus rips into one of Europe’s biggest economies. France is facing a shortage of personnel in some areas as employees wary of contracting the disease steer clear of their workplaces.
Part of the population was “irresponsible” to not be taking into account guidelines on confinement by “partying on the streets” and “going to the beach,” he said. Others, though, are over-reacting to the message of staying indoors, with some key workers not going to work. “We need to find a median path,” Macron told reporters as he visited researchers at the Pasteur Institute in Paris on Thursday.
On the French Riviera, the Cannes film festival became the latest event to be postponed. The gathering was slated to run May 12-23.

Volvo's Swedish factories in Torslanda, Skovde, Olofstrom, and its U.S. plant in South Carolina will close between March 26 and April 14, the company said. Its plant in Ghent, Belgium has already been temporarily shut down.
""Our primary concerns are the health of our employees and the future of our business,"" Chief Executive Hakan Samuelsson said. ""I think for the economy, we need to do something drastic, rather then trying half-hearted measures that drag on forever."" 
""We are seeing the effect from this coronavirus is increasing every day. We see problems in the logistics supply side,"" he told Reuters. ""We have to help contributing to social distancing.""
Samuelsson said the financial impact of the shutdown would become clearer when the carmaker published first-half earnings. The company will reduce the working hours of white-collar staff during the factory closures and will take advantage of government incentives, Samuelsson said. 
The financial impact on Volvo also depended on how different countries reacted to contain the virus. 

""There is a big difference between countries. Some have curfews, with restaurants and schools closed. In other countries there are less drastic measures. I just think we need to synchronize that more.""

The warning is the first time that Germany's largest lender has sounded the alarm on the outbreak, which has upended the bank's operations by causing it to split teams globally and cancel major events. Deutsche's shares have fallen to a record low amid a broad market rout.
""We may be materially adversely affected by a protracted downturn in local, regional or global economic condition,"" the bank said in its annual report.
The bank said on Friday that its forecasts in its annual report didn't factor in the effect of the virus. The bank is expected to provide an update on the outlook later in April when it reports earnings for the first quarter.
The bank has been trying to engineer a turnaround, and some executives and investors privately fear that the outbreak could stall the bank's restructuring efforts.
Last year, Deutsche posted a 5.7 billion euro ($6.13 billion) loss, its fifth in a row, as the cost of its latest turnaround attempt hit earnings.
Until the outbreak of the coronavirus in Europe, things had been looking up for Deutsche this year. Its shares rallied, it successfully issued a risky bond, regained market share in Germany and added new top investor.
Separately, the bank announced that Deutsche Boerse (DE:DB1Gn) chief Theodor Weimer will be nominated to the bank's supervisory board. 
""We will gain an expert with deep knowledge of the German and European financial industry as well as an outstanding banker,"" Deutsche Bank chairman Paul Achleitner said.
Reuters reported last year that some big investors would like Weimer to take over from Achleitner.
Weimer ""will join as a normal member of the supervisory board"", a Deutsche Boerse spokeswoman said.

The MSCI Asia Pacific Index rose as much as 2.4% Friday, set to snap a seven-day losing streak, in a relatively calm market free of steep drops and trading halts. The mood mirrored the sentiment in the U.S., where the S&P 500 avoided triggering price limits and held a 15-month-old support line.
Led by technology and oil shares, stock indexes across the region rebounded from the previous day, when multiple markets faced daily lower limits. Philippine stocks rebounded after plunging as much as 24% on Thursday. Battered Korean shares jumped as much as 5.9%. Japan’s markets were closed for a national holiday.
“Although the first positive day in what seems like forever is a welcome end to a tumultuous week, sentiment remains fragile,” Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst, Asia Pacific, Oanda Asia Pacific Pte. said in a note Friday. “We have seen plenty of examples in recent times of rallies turning into routs in double-quick time.”
Governments around the world have pledged or are considering as much as $3 trillion in fiscal support, in a two-front war against plunging business sentiment and a rout in financial markets. New Zealand’s central bank on Friday announced it will offer term loans to banks, a tool it last employed during the financial crisis. Australia is working on a “significantly bigger” second stimulus package than last week’s A$17.6 billion ($10.1 billion) fiscal injection.
“Parts of the market are coming to the terms that these fiscal measures are now c. +2% of global GDP,” said Kay Van-Petersen, global macro strategist at Saxo Capital Markets Pte. The stimulus packages are “starting to get to the size we need them to get.”
While Wall Street’s resilience overnight may have also provided some relief, investors are probably short-covering after two weeks of steep declines, said Jingyi Pan, market strategist at IG Asia Pte. in Singapore.
“Definitely recommending caution here, particularly with the past two Mondays seeing markets return to price in concerns over weekend developments,” Pan added.
Most observers are refraining from calling a bottom. Markets will “ultimately settle down” only on evidence of a peak in the infection rates, deployment of coordinated policy packages and “confidence that financial markets are functioning properly,” according to a note from BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) Investment Institute.
In the meantime, bargain hunters are making their presence felt in the region’s markets, as Asian equities trade almost at their estimated book value after starting the year with a 41% premium.
“Think of all the different strategies you can think of, they will be out there,” said Justin Tang, head of Asian research at United First Partners in Singapore. “The all clear hasn’t been sounded but it would appear that the worst is hopefully behind us.”"

This year, Airbus said it would pay a record $4 billion in fines after reaching a plea bargain with prosecutors in Britain, France and United States over accusations of bribery and corruption stretching back at least 15 years.
A French document detailing Airbus' settlement said Airbus had agreed to pay 15 million euros ($1.07 million) to a former top Korean Air executive in return for the airline's purchase of 10 A330 jets under contracts dating 1996-2000, then delivered part of the cash through a fake consulting contract using a middleman. 
""(Airbus) delivered rebates worth a total of 17.4 billion won on three occasions from 2010 to 2013 to the Korean Air side,"" the civic group People's Solidarity for Participatory Democracy said on Wednesday as it reported the allegation to prosecutors. 
The civic group said Hanjin Group chairman Walter Cho and his sister, Heather Cho, directors of Korean Air at that time, should be charged with breach of trust and embezzlement because they were involved in the purchase of aircraft and the payments. 
A Seoul Central District Prosecutor's Office spokesman said the office has launched an inquiry into the matter, without elaborating. 
Walter Cho and other current Hanjin Group executives said they had nothing to do with the Airbus payments, Korean Air said in a statement, speaking for Cho. 
Korean Air has recently requested information from Airbus to check past facts, plans to conduct an internal audit and take legal action if needed, it said. 
However, ""we will not sit idly by and watch actions that negatively affect the company's value by defaming the current management without grounds, and we will also seek civil and criminal measures,"" Korean Air said. 
Heather Cho said in a statement through her lawyer that she was not involved in any illegal decision-making, and will cooperate in clarifying the facts. 
Walter Cho and Heather Cho are locked in a proxy fight in Korean Air's parent firm, Hanjin Kal (KS:180640), before a March 27 annual general meeting, when shareholders will vote on who leads the conglomerate.

In a filing to the stock exchange, AirAsia said Airbus' sponsorship of a sports team the airline's top executives co-owned was at the relevant time disclosed to and supported by the Board of Directors of AirAsia Bhd (AAB), since renamed AirAsia Group.
""The sponsorship showed demonstrable benefits to the AirAsia Group and was not linked to any purchase decisions by AAB,"" the group said.
The board has therefore reinstated Chief Executive Tony Fernandes and Chairman Kamarudin Meranun, co-owners of the now-defunct Formula One racing team who stepped aside due to the matter on Feb. 3, the group said.
AirAsia earlier this year became embroiled in allegations that Airbus' $50 million sponsorship was aimed at influencing the group's aircraft acquisition.
The allegations were revealed as part of a record $4 billion settlement Airbus agreed with France, Britain and the United States. Prosecutors said the planemaker had bribed public officials and hidden payments as part of a pattern of corruption.
AirAsia said the two executives had properly disclosed interests to the board of directors and had abstained from discussions relating to the sponsorship.
It said independent reviewer BDO Governance Advisory also found that AirAsia's sponsorship of a sports team complied with procedures.
The Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission has previously said it would look into the SFO allegations, and Malaysia's Securities Commission said it would examine whether any securities laws had been breached.

Neither responded to Reuters requests on Friday for an update on their investigations.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Shares of SoftBank Group Corp (T:9984) closed down 17% on Thursday in their biggest one-day fall, hammered by investor scepticism over the outlook for tech bets, such as office sharing firm WeWork and ridehailer Uber (N:UBER).
As economic gloom grows over a coronavirus outbreak, SoftBank racked up the second biggest fall in the benchmark index (N225), breaking the 3,000-yen level to close at 2,687 yen.
The one-day fall is greater than during the bursting of the dot-com bubble, which evaporated most of Chief Executive Officer Masayoshi Son's wealth, as his plans to build a tech investing empire via the $100 billion Vision Fund stutter.
Uber's shares closed down 22% overnight as people around the world stay home to try and slow the spread of the virus.
SoftBank is considering pulling out of a $3 billion tender offer for WeWork, sources said. The startup has taken long property leases but is exposed to customers pulling out of short co-working contracts as the economy deteriorates.
""WeWork is very likely finished as a viable business,"" analyst Kirk Boodry wrote in a note on the Smartkarma platform, adding that ""Softbank faces a third straight quarter of losses for Vision Fund."""
950,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 20, 2020 02:24AM ET</span>","Cathay Pacific Slashes Total Passenger Capacity by 96% in April, May","By Alex Ho
 
Investing.com - Cathay Pacific Airways Limited (HK:0293) said it is slashing passenger capacity by 96% in April and May.
 
The airline will only operate three flights per week. “Our ability to maintain even this skeleton schedule will depend on whether more travel restrictions are imposed by governments around the world which will further dampen passenger demand,” the company said in its statement Friday.
 
“We need to take difficult but decisive measures as the scale of the challenge facing the global aviation industry is unprecedented,” Chief Customer and Commercial Officer Ronald Lam said in a statement. 
 
“Travel restrictions are making it increasingly difficult for our customers to travel and demand has dropped drastically.”
 
The airline warned earlier that it could face a substantial loss in the first half of this year. 
 
Hong Kong Express, the budget carrier Cathay bought in 2019, also said today that it is shutting down all flights operations temporarily. 
 
Many other major airlines have also cut their flight services and furloughed amid the worsening coronavirus situation globally. 
 
Qantas Airways Ltd (ASX:QAN) said yesterday that it is scrapping all international flights until at least the end of May. In Europe, Deutsche Lufthansa AG (DE:LHAG) said it will idle 700 aircraft and 95% of seats, while  American Airlines Group  (NASDAQ:AAL) will park 450 aircraft."

(Reuters) - Oklahoma's oilfields face some of the highest costs in the U.S. shale industry, making the state a likely first victim of the crash that has seen crude fall to its lowest price in 18 years. 
Oil companies in Oklahoma were laying off workers and slowing activity even before the spread of the coronavirus and the price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia. Now, with oil prices at $25 a barrel, many may be forced to shut completely. 
It costs around $48.19 a barrel to produce oil in Oklahoma's SCOOP and STACK shale plays, the highest in the United States, according to a  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) analysis. That compares with about $46.54 in North Dakota's Bakken and around $40 in the Permian. 
Continental Resources (N:CLR), which bet big in Oklahoma, on Thursday cut this year's spending plan by 55% to $1.2 billion and announced it would cut active drilling rigs to four from about 10 in the state. The company anticipates its U.S. production will fall by roughly 5% this year. 
The Oklahoma City-based producer is also reducing hydraulic fracturing work, two sources familiar with the matter said. A spokesperson for Continental declined comment. 
""As for Oklahoma being hit first with the price collapse, that has a lot to do with relative breakevens and financial decisions of Oklahoma operators,"" said Bernadette Johnson, vice president of market intelligence for Enverus. 
The number of producers completing wells in Oklahoma fell to less than 30 this year, versus roughly 130 last year, according to consultancy Primary Vision. Active pressure pumpers there have fallen from as many as 15 last year to six through March of this year. 
Other producers in Oklahoma like  Devon Energy  (N:DVN) and  Cimarex Energy  (N:XEC) have slashed spending.
""Almost everything is unsustainable"" at current prices, said Mike Cantrell, former president of the Oklahoma Energy Producers Alliance. ""I'm surprised they [big producers] have survived this long."" 
If producers quit drilling and completing wells, Oklahoma's production could drop more quickly than other states. The production decline rate for Oklahoma's oil wells is about 41%, versus 35% for the United States, according to Enverus. 
Oil service firms are being hit. Tulsa-based CDH Inc, an industrial maintenance and construction firm, laid off 57 people this week, according to the Oklahoma Office of Workforce Development. 

Advantage Oilfield Services, an oilfield firm from Lindsay, Oklahoma, is liquidating its equipment next week, according to a notice from Superior Energy Auctioneers, an industry auctioneer.

(Reuters) -  Air Canada  (TO:AC) will temporarily lay off more than 5,100 employees as it attempts to check the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, the union representing the Canadian airline's flight attendants said on Friday.
The Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE) said it was ""deeply saddened"" to learn that airline would temporarily lay off about 3,600 of its members at Air Canada mainline and all 1,549 of its members at Air Canada Rouge.
CUPE, which represents about 10,000 flight attendants at Air Canada and Air Canada Rouge, said the layoffs were effective until April 30 at the earliest.
Air Canada has initiated discussions with its unions to begin placing employees on temporary, off-duty status, the company told Reuters on Friday.
""Employees would be returned to active duty status when we ramp up our network schedule as conditions allow,"" the company said in an emailed statement.
Earlier this week, Air Canada said it would gradually suspend the majority of its international and U.S. trans-border flights by March 31 in response to the coronavirus crisis.
Airline industry executives around the globe have called for state support as travel demand collapses at an unprecedented rate and governments impose restrictions due to the pandemic.
Air Canada has ""no choice"" but to cut staff, calling the move ""difficult but necessary,"" CBC News, which first reported the news, quoted the airline's vice president of in-flight service as saying.
The highly contagious coronavirus has infected more than 234,000 people across the world and the death toll currently exceeds 9,700.

953,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 20, 2020 12:35AM ET</span>",The Five Days When World Economy’s Guardians Fought Virus and Market Turmoil,"(Bloomberg) -- The guardians of the world economy are in a two-front war. They are having to defend businesses and consumers that suddenly look frighteningly vulnerable to the coronavirus -- and contain a rout on financial markets that threatens to make things even worse.
Those battles amid a unique pandemic this week forced political leaders and central bankers into action at a pace that puts even that of the 2008 financial crisis in the shade. Their economies are on course to post historic slumps in output over the coming weeks, a prospect that is panicking investors.
If markets, executives and the general public can’t be persuaded that there’s light at the end of the tunnel for the U.S. and Europe in the second half of this year, then they risk turning darker scenarios into self-fulfilling prophecies – and pushing the world into a deeper downturn and perhaps even a Depression.
Among monetary policy makers, the state of red-alert began on Sunday night with Jerome Powell chairing an unscheduled Federal Reserve meeting – the first of several that officials would have to convene and sign off in a hurry on new emergency moves.“Monetary policy decisions at midnight,” said Torsten Slok,  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) AG’s chief economist, “tells you how serious they are about trying to stabilize things.”
Then on Monday, with stocks still sliding and volatility elevated despite the Fed cutting interest rates, Group of Seven chiefs leapt into the fray -- concluding a rare teleconference with a pledge to do “whatever is necessary.”
Exactly what that may be, the world still can’t say for sure.As the week draws to an end, an unprecedented 31 central banks have slashed interest rates -- and many of them have gone further and activated the crisis playbook, buying bonds, intervening in currency markets and setting up emergency loan programs for banks and companies.
What Bloomberg’s Economists Say...
“The rush to downgrade forecasts for the first half of the year makes sense. Optimism about the second half is more open to question. Getting to recovery will require swift delivery of a massive stimulus program, and - more important - an outbreak that comes obediently under control. Neither are even close to guaranteed.”
-- Tom Orlik, Chief Economist
In under a week, the Fed has cut its key interest rate by 100 basis points to near zero, resurrected an emergency financing facility and set up a string of programs that make it a player in the markets for government bonds, mortgage-backed securities, commercial paper and mutual funds. That’s as well as its attempt to supply dollars.
For European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde and colleagues, priorities were a bit different – including a spike in government-bond yields for countries like Italy, where budget deficits are about to explode. Meeting into the Frankfurt night on Thursday, they unveiled a 750 billion euro bond-buying program and declared there are “no limits” on what they would do to protect the euro.
Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda doubled a program of asset purchases and the Reserve Bank of Australia said it would join the QE club for the first time and begin targeting a yield of 0.25% for the three-year bond. It also cut its benchmark interest rate to that level.
Counterparts from South Korea and Poland to Ghana and Canada all cut rates, leaving Morgan Stanley’s measure of the world’s average interest rate close to zero -- and less than half of its level of December.
The politicians in charge of budgets – earlier criticized for being slow to realize that their nations were as vulnerable to the pandemic as China – were finally hitting the accelerator too. They’ve lined up a dizzying run of fiscal stimulus measures, already worth more than $3 trillion and rising fast, from tax cuts to new welfare programs and loan guarantees.
President Donald Trump acknowledged the need to “go big,” and is pushing a $1.3 trillion package that will include checks in the mail and bailouts in industries like airlines, where business has ground to a halt.
The details varied, but substantial programs were being rolled out in Paris and London – where Trump’s counterparts, Emmanuel Macron and Boris Johnson, were joining the U.S. president in adopting the language of wartime.
The numbers say they’re right to.
“This is likely to be the biggest public sector mobilization in a single week -- as a percentage of gross domestic product -- since World War II,” said David Mann, chief economist for  Standard Chartered  (LON:STAN) Plc. “At least for the U.S. and Europe.”
And if the scale of policy plans evokes such historic comparisons, so does the juddering halt in commerce.JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co. is telling clients to brace for a 40% slump in Chinese output in the first quarter, followed by 14% drop in the U.S. over the subsequent three months – figures not seen for at least a half-century.The full-year estimates don’t look as alarming, because the epidemic is expected to peak and then ebb. Still, JPMorgan’s economists expect world output to shrink 1.1% in 2020, worse than the 0.8% drop posted during the recession year of 2009, though their Wall Street counterparts are a bit more optimistic.
In Australia, which rode out the last crisis without slipping into recession,  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). now forecast the sharpest annual GDP contraction since the great depression of the 1920s.
As if economies hitting a wall wasn’t bad enough, traders were beset with other risks. A recently erupted oil-price war drove energy prices down. Work-from-home regimes were sapping liquidity, and giant price swings were forcing liquidations -- creating the conditions for a vicious downward spiral.
The week’s first day on equity markets began badly – and ended worse, as Trump’s afternoon warning that virus disruption could last into summer sent the S&P 500 careening into a 12% decline, the worst since 1987. And the whipsaw effect has dominated every day since.
Bonds were scarcely less volatile. They tumbled when governments unveiled plans to spend vast amounts of cash – and rallied when central banks pledged to buy swaths of the resulting debt.
Credit markets were pricing in higher default risks, even as officials were trying to prevent a funding crunch by freeing up space on dealers’ balance sheets. The oil war ensured commodities kept sliding.The situation found ways to get worse. Foreign exchange markets came under strain amid an inexorable rise in demand for the dollar. Some central banks were forced to intervene – and the most powerful among them, the Fed, worked across borders to ensure flows of the world’s reserve currency.
If there’s doubt whether such a broad-based policy salvo will succeed, that’s because none of its components – chiefly, more spending and lower interest rates – amount to a vaccine against a deadly epidemic. Market stress will likely persist until the global rates of infection stabilize.
As the week wore on, there was a few encouraging signs. China, where 80,000 people have been infected, on Thursday reported no new domestic cases for the first time since the start of the crisis. Still, its markets sank.
There’s no parallel for this frenzied pace even in the crisis of 2008 --the benchmark for end-of-the-world sentiment among most people on the markets today. Several months separated that year’s Fed action and the launch of a rescue program for troubled assets. G-20 leaders didn’t really show common resolve until April 2009.
“The only real policy that can win the day against the virus is something that makes it safe for people to return to work,” said Wall Street strategist David Zervos. “Short of this, the virus will just keep winning and the policies will only work to minimize the bloodletting.”

954,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 20, 2020 12:00AM ET</span>",Listed China firms' filing delays hit five-year high as virus thwarts auditors,"By Engen Tham, Julie Zhu and Alun John
SHANGHAI/HONG KONG (Reuters) - The number of mainland China-listed firms to delay filing annual reports has hit a five-year high, indicating auditors' struggle to sign off accounts after the government effectively closed businesses last month to slow the coronavirus outbreak.
The first three months of the year are a busy time for firms with year-end accounts which often need to be filed by March-end. But a widespread lockdown for all of February prevented auditors from visiting clients or reaching bankers and company officials to make the checks needed to approve client accounts.
Under normal circumstances, a delay in filing could impact a company's ability to raise funds if it cannot show would-be investors and lenders up-to-date figures. A delay could also damage confidence in the company, pulling down its share price.
Should the delay run beyond April, a company can apply to the stock exchange for a further delay. If no application is made, it could be fined or have trading of its stock suspended.
As of Friday morning, 852 companies - about 22% of all firms listed on mainland exchanges - had delayed filing annual accounts this year, showed five-year data from official website cninfo.com.cn. Some have since filed, some are still outstanding.
The total compared to 506 firms for all of 2019, and is the highest in at least five years.
The virus has had ""a large impact on auditing,"" said Daniel Li, a senior partner at PwC Zhong Tian.
Accountants need to be on site to check original documents, such as contracts and receipts, Li said. But they have been unable to do so because authorities ordered many businesses to close and advised people to stay home to stop the virus, which has now infected 242,000 worldwide and led to 10,000 deaths.
""Clients can give us copies, but we still need to check that those copies are exactly the same as the originals,"" said Li.
'RIDICULOUS'
Many of China's banks rotated employees for a number of weeks in February, complicating auditors' struggle to access letters of confirmation - crucial documents detailing, for instance, how much a firm has in its accounts - auditors said.
Many auditors found even contacting clients became a daily frustration.
Ms Chan, a Hong Kong-based auditor working for one of the so-called Big Four accounting firms, said it took her almost two weeks in February to get hold of the right person at a client's office to clarify a single point.
""It's rather ridiculous. My work has become very inefficient,"" Chan said of preparing accounts for a Hong Kong-listed Chinese financial institution.
""I've lost count of the number of calls, sometimes cold calls, that I have to make every day, just asking for tiny details or numbers,"" she said, declining to give her full name as she was not authorised to speak with media on the matter.
To relieve the plight of Hong Kong-listed firms, Hong Kong's stock exchange and markets regulator on Monday extended the deadline for annual reports, having already relaxed reporting standards for earnings announcements. 
Mainland firms account for half of all companies listed on the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong. Moreover, many Hong Kong-headquartered firms have major mainland operations and so have faced similar auditing delays.
A spokesman for Hong Kong's exchange said the bourse expects most of its listed companies will be able to publish accounts without incident.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Walt  Disney  Co (N:DIS), JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) and  United Parcel  Service Inc (N:UPS) were among seven major U.S. companies that accepted a big rise in their borrowing costs to issue bonds on Thursday, as the coronavirus outbreak roiled credit markets.
The companies, that also included  Citigroup  Inc (N:C),  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS),  Northrop Grumman  Corp (N:NOC) and MetLife Inc (N:MET), raised a combined $18.6 billion through the issuance of investment-grade bonds, according to Refinitiv IFR data. 
Disney issued five new bonds, including a $1.25 billion 10-year loan which priced at a 270 basis point premium to U.S. Treasuries at a 3.8% yield. By comparison, Disney raised $2 billion in September with a premium of only 70 basis points and a yield of around 2.2%.
The higher borrowing costs indicate that strain persists in the credit markets, despite the efforts of governments and central banks to support the financial system. The U.S. Federal Reserve has taken a series of steps over the last two weeks to boost liquidity, including cutting borrowing costs to near zero and embarking on large-scale asset purchases.
The novel coronavirus has infected more than 200,000 people globally but may be in its early stages in the United States. It has prompted many countries to order businesses to close and restrict movements of entire populations to limit its spread.
JPMorgan raised $2.5 billion at a 340 basis point premium, compared to 100 basis points in November on debt with a similar duration, albeit worth only $750 million. 
United Parcel Service saw the premium of its debt to U.S. Treasuries spike to 335 basis points from 85 basis points in August. 
Citigroup issued debt with a maturity of 21 years, longer than anything it has issued in at least 12 months, according to Refinitiv IFR records. The 2041 debt was at a 350 basis point premium to U.S. Treasuries, compared to 90 basis points on debt maturing in 2031 done in January. 
Morgan Stanley raised $2 billion in debt which matures in 2051, also a longer duration that anything the bank has issued in the last 12 months. The debt was issued at a premium of 375 basis points compared to 92 basis points for a 5-year debt deal in July. 

The other two issuers, Northrop Grumman and MetLife, tapped the investment-grade debt market for cash for the first time in over a year to raise $2.25 billion and $1 billion respectively, according to Refinitiv IFR.

SYDNEY/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Shattered airlines were left counting the cost of government support as countries from the United States to New Zealand set out conditions for bailouts needed to absorb the shock of the coronavirus pandemic.
Conditions include provisions that loans may convert to government equity stakes, while U.S. airlines cannot increase executive pay or provide ""golden parachutes"" for two years. Air New Zealand's (NZ:AIR) bailout also depends on the company suspending its dividend and paying interest rates of 7% to 9%. 
New Zealand on Friday offered its national carrier a NZ$900 million ($510 million) lifeline, which Finance Minister Grant Robertson said would help it survive after the government banned all non-resident arrivals to the country.
""That puts us in a very good position over the next several months,"" Air New Zealand chief executive Greg Foran told reporters of the loan, which it will not draw down immediately. ""We would expect the airline industry will look different at the end of this. Not all airlines are going to survive.""
Under the $58 billion U.S. proposal for passenger and cargo carriers, the U.S. Treasury Department could receive warrants, stock options, or stock.
""We are not bailing out the airlines or other industries – period,"" U.S. Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Richard Shelby said. ""Instead, we are allowing the Treasury Secretary to make or guarantee collateralized loans to industries whose operations the coronavirus outbreak has jeopardized.""
Norway will back airlines with credit guarantees worth up to 6 billion Norwegian crowns ($537 million), half of them to  Norwegian Air Shuttle ASA  (OL:NWC). Conditions include raising money from commercial banks and the equity market.
Finland, which owns a 56% stake in Finnair (HE:FIA1S), said it would guarantee a 600 million euro ($645 million) loan for the state carrier. The firm said it was implementing a funding plan that included drawing on available credit lines, sale and leasebacks of planes. Its stock jumped 16%.
The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has forecast the industry will need up to $200 billion of state support, piling pressure on governments facing demands from all quarters and a rapid worsening in public finances as economies slump.
""Money is very tight in most countries, so governments need to step back and be hard-nosed about any form of rescue ... but it all must come with strict conditions or strings, attached,"" Shukor Yusof, head of aviation consultancy Endau Analytics, said in an email.
JOBS GONE
Even with financial assistance, airlines around the world are placing thousands of workers on unpaid leave as they slash passenger capacity, deepening the shocks to local economies.
British Airways (L:ICAG) pilots will have to take two weeks of unpaid leave in each of April and May, and a cut to basic pay spread over three months, the company said on Friday in a joint statement with the British Airline Pilots' Association. 
Britain's Heathrow Airport, usually Europe's busiest airport, is cutting costs by cancelling executive pay, freezing recruitment and reviewing all capital projects.
 Air Canada  (TO:AC) has more than 5,100 excess cabin crew after cutting its flying schedule and plans to start notifying them they will be laid off at least temporarily, its flight attendants union said.
The airline said it had begun talks with unions about temporary lay-offs but did not have final numbers yet.
On Friday, Cathay Pacific Airways (HK:0293) said it would slash nearly all passenger capacity as new government curbs make travel more difficult.
Its low-cost carrier, HK Express, will suspend operations from Monday until April 30, bringing forward plans to put employees on unpaid leave.
To preserve cash, airlines are also cutting executive pay, suspending dividends, selling planes, and flying cargo on empty passenger jets. This has led to surging cargo rates due to high demand - the only bright spot in the industry.
American Airlines (O:AAL) said on Thursday it would use some passenger jets to move cargo between the United States and Europe, its first scheduled cargo-only flights since 1984 when it retired the last of its 747 freighters.
In the Asia-Pacific, Qantas, Cathay, Korean Air Lines (KS:003490) are also operating some flights with empty seats but bellies full of cargo.

Chazen's appointment could be announced in the coming days, assuming discussions don't fall apart, the report said.

SEATTLE (Reuters) -  Boeing Co  (N:BA) is leaning toward a temporary work stoppage at its twin-aisle jetliner factories due to the spread of coronavirus, people familiar with the matter said on Thursday, echoing a similar move by European rival Airbus SE (PA:AIR).
The U.S. planemaker has not made a final decision on the timing and duration of a potential work stoppage as it weighs health guidance and broader impacts to its supply chain.
Boeing would use a stoppage of a few days to conduct a deep clean of its Washington state and South Carolina twin-aisle factories, but seems broadly committed for now to keeping production lines running after the suspension, the people said. 
A Boeing spokesman declined to comment.
The fast-spreading coronavirus has disrupted life across the United States, hammering the economy and virtually wiping out air travel demand.
Airbus announced plans earlier this week to halt operations at its plants in France and Spain for four days, after Reuters reported it was studying plans to slow or halt production. 
Boeing, which employs 70,000 people in Seattle's Puget Sound area, has some 14 confirmed coronavirus cases as of Thursday, many reported at its Everett hub north of Seattle. 
As cases rise, so too have angst and anger among some rank-and-file machinists, insiders say. A number of workers have used an ""Imminent Danger, Stop Work"" contract clause to halt specific jobs until safety concerns are addressed. 
One 777 work crew was sent home earlier this week due to concerns of infection, and mechanics on the next shift refused to work on the same jet because they were not sure the area was cleaned properly, one person with knowledge of the matter said.
Confirming a Reuters report, Boeing said last week it was freezing hiring and industry sources have said layoffs or furloughs are likely as virus concerns peak. 
Boeing suppliers, already reeling from a production halt on Boeing's 737 line due to a year-old safety ban, face an even slimmer workload as flight cancellations mean less airline demand for spare parts and services.
Aircraft parts shortages were likely, while productivity could take another blow from enforced minimum distances between workers inside factories, industry sources say.
Boeing representatives have been contacting parts suppliers to remind them to follow guidance from U.S. health officials, gather information on personnel and contingency plans, and warn firms to restrict visitors while also meeting contractual obligations, supplier sources said. 

Airbus plans to resume output at French and Spanish plants on March 23 but industry sources say there are doubts over how long either planemaker can maintain the previous levels of output because of scattered shortages in the supply chain.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Engineer Anthony Levandowski, known for advancing self-driving car technology in the last decade, agreed to plead guilty on Thursday to taking sensitive documents from his former employer Google before joining rival Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc.
Federal prosecutors agreed to recommend a prison term of no more than 30 months as part of plea agreement in one of the most well-known corporate disputes in recent Silicon Valley history. 
""We hope that this plea will allow him to move on with his life and focus his energies where they matter most,"" developing new technologies, his attorney, Miles Ehrlich, said in a statement. 
The U.S. attorney's office in San Francisco declined to comment. 
The office is tasked with policing intellectual property theft in the largest U.S. tech hub. Last month, it dropped what remained of a trade secrets theft case involving wearable device company Fitbit Inc and now-defunct rival Jawbone after a San Francisco jury acquitted the first defendant.
The Levandowski case stemmed from accusations by Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google and its sister company Waymo in 2017 that Uber jump-started its own self-driving car development with trade secrets and staff that Levandowski unlawfully took from Google. 
Uber issued company stock to Alphabet and revised its software to settle, and the Department of Justice later announced a 33-count criminal indictment against Levandowski.
Prosecutors accused Levandowski of stealing materials in late 2015 and early 2016 after deciding to leave Google and form his own company, Ottomotto, which Uber later bought.
He faced 10 years in prison on each count if convicted.
But he is pleading guilty to one count, which accused him of downloading to his personal computer a file that tracked technical goals for Google's self-driving project. A sentencing hearing has not been scheduled. 
""I downloaded these files with the intent to use them for my own personal benefit, and I understand that I was not authorized to take the files for that purpose,"" Levandowski said in court papers.
Levandowski, who filed for bankruptcy on March 4 to negotiate his debts, also agreed to pay nearly $756,500 in restitution to cover costs Alphabet bore assisting the government's investigation, according to court papers. 
The bankruptcy declaration followed a California state court confirming that Levandowski owes $179 million to Google for violating employment contracts.

Uber indemnifies workers under its employment agreements but has said it expects to challenge paying the big judgment on behalf of its ex-employee.

SYDNEY/BENGALURU (Reuters) - Air New Zealand (NZ:AIR) said on Friday it was offered a NZ$900 million ($514 million) lifeline by the government to keep the airline flying as travel curbs to stem the coronavirus outbreak threaten the survival of many airlines globally. 
Shares fell as much as 35% to the lowest level since 2012 in their first trading since last March 13.
The airline had halted trading after the New Zealand government said on Saturday all arrivals would need to self-isolate for two weeks. The restrictions were extended further on Thursday, barring all non-residents from entering the country.
Airline industry executives worldwide have called for state support now that passenger operations are collapsing at an unprecedented rate and governments curb travel drastically.
""Without this intervention, New Zealand was at risk of not having a national airline,"" New Zealand Finance Minister Grant Robertson said in a statement.
The national carrier, which is 52% government-owned, said the loan would be given in two tranches, with interest rates ranging from 7% to 9% a year, and on condition that it cancels its interim dividend worth NZ$123 million ($69.78 million), which Air New Zealand said it would.
""The loan facility ensures that Air New Zealand can continue to play a vital role in connecting New Zealanders and our businesses with each other here at home and around the world,"" Air New Zealand Chairman Therese Walsh said in a statement.
The government has the ability to seek repayment through a capital raising by the airline after six months, or converting the loan to equity. The loan will be available for 24 months.
""While today's action means the company can continue to operate, given the unprecedented shock to the global aviation industry caused by COVID-19, Air New Zealand has advised that there will unfortunately be job losses as capacity is cut,"" Robertson said. 
The airline said on Monday it would cut long-haul capacity by 85% and look to lay off some permanent employees as the coronavirus crushes global travel demand.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The cost for companies to borrow short-term loans increased again on Thursday, suggesting investors remained skeptical that the Federal Reserve's facility announced on Tuesday would significantly improve liquidity in the commercial paper market.
The Fed will reinstate an operation used during the 2008 financial crisis called the Commercial Paper Funding Facility (CPFF) to get credit directly to businesses. But the price the Fed is asking is far higher than it was in 2008 and may not do much to encourage prospective issuers or to anchor costs.
The rate to borrow both low- and high-grade 90-day paper - the longest maturity on offer - rose by about 20 basis points each on Thursday, according to two sources active in the commercial paper market. For overnight paper, the rate for lower-grade paper rose by 10 basis points, and by 5 for higher-grade paper.
There were some signs that stress was beginning to ease, however.
Overnight rates had also risen on Wednesday, according to Fed data posted Thursday, though the spread between overnight low- and high-grade rates, which had on Tuesday risen to the widest level since 2008, narrowed slightly.
Spread widening suggests investors are demanding higher premiums to hold risky debt.
The FRA-OIS spread , a proxy for risk in the banking sector, widened by 6.4 basis points on Thursday, though it was off the post-financial-crisis high hit on Monday. The widening spread this week has indicated that investors bet that companies will continue to draw on existing lines of credit at banks, potentially putting them under stress.
Companies including  Boeing Co  (N:BA),  Hilton Worldwide  Holdings Inc (N:HLT) and SeaWorld Entertainment Inc (N:SEAS) have drawn on lines of credit with banks in recent weeks.

The company said it expects the manufacturing center to suspend operations for the next two weeks as Philip Morris USA will continue to monitor the ""evolving situation"".
The virus outbreak has affected more than 227,700 people across 175 countries, based on a Reuters tally, and caused 150 deaths in the United States.
Philip Morris USA believes it has sufficient finished goods cigarette inventory for about two months based on current estimated shipping volume, in addition to current wholesale and retail inventories, Altria said.
Richmond, Virginia-based Altria also announced suspension of some John Middleton domestic operations for two weeks due to supply chain constraints related to the outbreak.
John Middleton believes it has sufficient finished goods cigar inventory for about three months, Altria said. 
Altria's shares were down 1% at $36.73 in extended trading.

Global stock markets have slumped since the coronavirus outbreak has halted most business activities, led to the fallout of many industries and spooked investors about a possible recession.
According to the Bloomberg report, LVMH has discussed the plan with Tiffany's board, which could give the potential transaction a green signal after reporting quarterly results.
Tiffany is due to report its results on Friday. 
LVMH is yet to make a decision on the transaction and is discussing potential legal hurdles to the idea, the report said. 
Last month, LVMH was set to raise 9.3 billion euros from bond markets to help to finance the deal, which is expected to be completed in the middle of 2020. The latest move affirms the French company's interest in Tiffany.
Both LVMH and Tiffany were not immediately available for comment. 
Tiffany has temporarily closed several stores, including its Fifth Avenue flagship store in New York, and reduced working hours at other outlets to stop the spread of the coronavirus.

The company's share closed up 14.3% at $126.51%.

Dimon has been closely involved in many of the bank's high-profile decisions during the past few weeks as the coronavirus pandemic roiled global markets, said the source, who requested anonymity because Dimon's plans have not been formalized. 
Earlier this week, the U.S. bank was the first to announce it would suspend stock buybacks until June 30.
It also announced it would access funding from the Federal Reserve's so-called ""discount window,"" and that it was closing 1,000 Chase branches to allow more staff to work from home and avoid the fast-spreading virus.
Dimon had emergency heart surgery on March 5 to repair a tear to his aorta.
The aorta is usually replaced with a synthetic tube, and recovery can generally take around seven to eight weeks. 

Co-presidents and co-chief operating officers Daniel Pinto and Gordon Smith have been running operations while Dimon recovers, and both have spoken frequently with Dimon on conference calls throughout the past two weeks, the source said.

The value of the new instruments totaled 304 billion pesos ($4.794 billion), the ministry said. 
The auction, reported exclusively by Reuters on Wednesday, was part of Argentina's broader drive to gain more time to make payments amid a widespread debt crisis that risks pushing the country into default.
Argentina has been focused on rolling over its local bonds though a series of debt swap auctions, but it faces a tougher challenge with its international debt. The country is racing to strike a deal with foreign creditors by the end of the month.
It is also in talks about revamping its borrowings from the International Monetary Fund, which extended a then $57 billion credit facility to the South American grains producer in 2018. It has so far disbursed around $44 billion.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A Republican proposal introduced in the U.S. Senate on Thursday would grant up to $58 billion in secured loans to help passenger and cargo airlines hit by the coronavirus crisis, but bar cash grants and could result in the government getting equity stakes.
Under the proposal, the U.S. Treasury Department could receive warrants, stock options, or stock as a condition of government assistance in order for the government to participate in gains and be compensated for risks.
The measure would also bar airlines from increasing compensation for, or provide golden parachutes to, executives for two years and airlines would be required to maintain some services. It would suspend some aviation taxes.
""We are not bailing out the airlines or other industries – period,"" said Senator Richard Shelby, who chairs the appropriations committee.
The proposal comes after major airlines doubled down on Thursday on a request for government cash grants. 
""The current economic environment is simply not sustainable,"" Airlines for America and a coalition of major aviation unions wrote in a joint letter. 
The group, representing  American Airlines Group  (O:AAL), Delta Air Lines Inc (N:DAL), United Airlines (O:UAL) and other airlines, and unions urged lawmakers to provide a package of unsecured loans, grants and tax relief.
""The survival of our industry depends on it,"" they wrote.
The airline group had asked on Monday for $25 billion in cash grants and $25 billion in unsecured loans for passenger airlines and another $8 billion for cargo carriers.
As travel demand has collapsed due to the health crisis, airlines have suspended thousands of flights, parking hundreds of airplanes and borrowing money. They have repeatedly warned that they may cut thousands of employees without significant assistance soon.
The bill introduced on Thursday would set aside another $150 billion for a separate fund and Treasury would determine who could qualify.  Boeing Co  (N:BA), which has sought $60 billion in U.S. government loan guarantees for itself and the entire aviation manufacturing sector, could seek loans from that fund.
Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said ""the airline industry just spent billions and billions in stock buybacks in the last two years - liquidity that would come in handy at a time like this."" 
But Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell defended the plans.
""We're not talking about so-called bailouts for firms that made reckless decisions,"" said McConnell. ""We're not talking about a taxpayer-funded cushion for companies that made mistakes. We're talking about loans which must be repaid.""
U.S. President Donald Trump said Thursday he opposed companies using taxpayer funds for executive bonuses or stock buybacks.

""Conditions like that would be OK with me,"" Trump said Thursday, but added: ""“We will be helping the airline industry.""

""I cannot support a move to lean on the federal government for a stimulus or bailout that prioritizes our company over others and relies on taxpayers to guarantee our financial position,"" Haley said in a letter to the company's management released by Boeing on Thursday.
""I have long held strong convictions that this is not the role of government.""
Haley, a former South Carolina governor, has often been mentioned as a future presidential candidate. ""The board and executive team are going in a direction I cannot support,"" she wrote.
When asked to respond to Haley's concerns, Boeing said only the company appreciated her service on the board and wished her well.
Boeing this week said it was seeking on behalf of itself and the aviation manufacturing industry at least $60 billion in government loan guarantees and other assistance. The sector faces huge losses from the coronavirus pandemic as airlines halt flights and some delay orders.
A Senate Republican proposal introduced Thursday would allow aviation manufacturing firms like Boeing to seek collateralized loans and loan guarantees from a $150 billion fund but not provide any cash. The final decision on eligibility would be up to the U.S. Treasury.

CHICAGO (Reuters) - Demand for U.S. meat at grocery stores will likely exceed supplies for at least another week, the chief executive of  Tyson Foods  Inc (NYSE:TSN) told Reuters on Thursday, as the coronavirus pandemic fuels panic buying among shoppers.
Food manufacturers say overall meat supplies are ample to feed the millions of Americans hunkering down in their homes after state and local governments closed schools, bars and restaurants in an escalation of ""social distancing"" policies aimed at containing the virus. 
But a surge in demand for products from chicken and beef to dry pasta at supermarkets has left store shelves and meat cases empty, alarming consumers.
""Once we are able to replenish supplies, which is probably going to take another week or so, then I think that we'll be back in better equilibrium between supply and demand,"" Tyson CEO Noel White said in an interview. 
He later added: ""In the short term, being a matter of weeks, there are some imbalances that exist.""
The ""imbalances"" are more demand than supply in sectors like retail stores, White said. The total amount of beef, pork and poultry available in the United States is up about 2% to 3% from last year, he said.
Orders for meat from grocery stores were significantly higher than usual through the weekend, after demand began to shift away from restaurants last week, White said. 
""The demand hit very quickly,"" White said. ""The order fill rate has improved. It's still not where we would expect it to be.""
Increased buying at supermarkets has lifted overall demand for meat, although the increase has been largely offset by reduced demand from restaurants, White said. Demand from casual dining restaurants, in particular, has suffered, though fast-food restaurants continue to benefit from strong drive-through traffic, he said. Tyson is the largest U.S. meat supplier and counts companies like McDonald's Corp (NYSE:MCD) as customers.
To meet increased retail demand, Tyson has shifted processing facilities to produce food for grocery stores instead of restaurants, White said. The company is running slaughterhouses at full capacity and on weekends, he said.
U.S. cattle futures have dropped sharply on concerns slaughterhouses will close if the novel coronavirus spreads among workers.

To avoid shutdowns, Tyson has begun taking employees' temperatures at two processing facilities and is expanding the practice to all U.S. workers, according to the company. It expects deliveries of several thousand thermometers on Thursday, White said.

(Reuters) - Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) has told employees it reduced the number of workers at its California vehicle factory to curb the spread of coronavirus as Chief Executive Elon Musk said the company may start producing ventilators to ease a U.S. shortage.
In an email to employees late on Wednesday night, Tesla said it had asked only ""essential employees"" to report to its Bay Area facilities, allowing all others to work from home with San Francisco on virtual lockdown.
In a previous email to employees on Monday, Tesla described essential staff as all those directly supporting factory production, vehicle deliveries and service, saying people in those areas should continue to report to work.
U.S. automakers  Ford Motor Co  (N:F), General Motors Co (N:GM) and  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles NV (MI:FCHA), (N:FCAU) on Wednesday said they were shuttering their U.S. plants, as well as factories in Canada and Mexico, to stop the spread of coronavirus. 
At Tesla, extra precautions are now being taken to try to protect workers from the highly contagious respiratory illness that has infected more than 10,700 Americans. 
Beginning on Thursday, workers will receive masks and have their temperature checked prior to entry, Wednesday night's email said, adding that more hygiene stations will be added and the cleaning frequency of work areas be increased.
The electric carmaker also said it had not laid off anyone amid the coronavirus outbreak.
Officials from the city of Fremont were to meet with Tesla on Thursday to discuss a county-wide coronavirus lockdown order, a county spokesman said.
Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the meeting.
""We are moving ahead in the full understanding that they will have to comply with minimum basic requirements,"" Ray Kelly, Alameda County's public information officer, said.
Alameda County, where the factory is based, is one of six covered by an order from regional officials to ""shelter in place,"" which limits activity, travel and business functions to only the most essential, and advises people to stay home except for the most crucial reasons.
The county sheriff's office said on Tuesday afternoon Tesla was not considered an essential business and cannot continue to operate its factory normally.
Minimum basic operations under the county's order include maintaining the value of inventory, ensuring security and processing payroll and employee benefits.
The electric carmaker told its employees in an email on Monday that federal guidelines allowed it to keep operating vehicle manufacturing operations.
A spokeswoman for the Fremont police department on Wednesday said attorneys from the city and county were discussing how state and federal exemptions factored into the local lockdown order.
A factory employee requesting anonymity told Reuters vehicle production on Thursday appeared to continue unchanged, with workers at the assembly lines working in close proximity.
Tesla's sole U.S. auto factory employs more than 10,000 workers, with annualized production of slightly more than 415,000 units by the fourth quarter.
The coronavirus outbreak comes as Tesla ramps up production of its Model Y sport utility vehicle at the factory, which Musk has said will see higher demand than all of Tesla's other models combined.
Alameda County officials on Wednesday said Tesla had agreed to reduce the number of active workers at its factory to around 2,500.
But Kelly, the county spokesman, said discussions were ongoing about halting vehicle production.
""It sounds to me like they very well could still be making cars. We are continuing to stress to them that they must move to minimum basic operations, if they are still making cars,"" he said.
Separately on Thursday, hundreds of Twitter users welcomed an offer by Musk to make ventilators for coronavirus sufferers, after the United States appealed for donations of respirator masks to combat a shortage.
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization said it was in talks with China and others to help ramp up supplies of health equipment, while General Motors (N:GM) and Ford Motor (N:F) said they were in talks with White House officials.
""We will make ventilators if there is a shortage,"" Musk wrote on Twitter, responding to a fan's suggestion the billionaire re-purpose a factory for the task.

The Trump administration on Tuesday urged U.S. construction companies to donate respirator masks to hospitals and healthcare providers fighting the virus, amid a nationwide shortage.

(Reuters) - Latin America's major airlines sharply curtailed international flights on Thursday because of the coronavirus outbreak as Panama and Colombia imposed month-long travel bans and the largest carrier cut the salaries of 43,000 employees. 
The bans by Panama and Colombia, effective on Monday, came after Peru, Argentina and Chile, among others, severely curtailed flights.
The measures intensified pressure on the region's airlines, whose shares have tumbled more than their peers in other countries.
Chile-based LATAM Airlines Group, the continent's largest, said it would halve the salaries of its 43,000 employees and its new chief executive would forego his salary for three months. 
The region's No. 2 airline, Colombia-based Avianca Holdings (CN:AVT_p), said it was canceling all its international flights and four out of five domestic flights in Colombia.
Avianca will go to flying just 10 planes, half of which are small turboprops, from 142.
Mexican airline Aeromexico is slashing its domestic flight capacity by 35% and international capacity by 50%, which meant grounding 40 aircraft immediately, according to an internal company memo seen by Reuters.
Panama-based Copa Airlines, the No. 3 Latin American carrier by international flights, faced an unprecedented crisis as Panama shut down international flights through its main hub. 
Virtually all of Copa's flights go through Panama City's airport. Copa declined to comment.
Brazil's largest domestic carrier, Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes, said on Thursday it would cut worker pay by 35% and executive pay by 40% ""initially"" for three months. 
The developments left Latin America's airlines facing an uncertain future and stranded many passengers who were unable to book flights to get home. The coronavirus pandemic has sickened more than 240,000 people globally and killed more than 9,800.
The region's exception was Brazil, which has shut down land borders but not air travel. Thursday's developments added to many cuts already announced. 
LATAM is planning to cut 70% of its flights, and Copa at least 80%, as Latin American countries have shut their borders to air travel. 
Gol has slashed half its flights, but the carrier is more focused on travel within Brazil, which is not directly affected by cross-border bans.
Avianca declined to comment on potential salary cuts. 
Cutting executive pay has been a common response to the coronavirus, which has upended life around the globe.
Brazilian airline Azul SA said last week it would offer some workers unpaid leave and cut executive pay by 25%. 

Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) CEO Edward Bastian said he would also forego his salary through the outbreak. Delta owns a 20% stake in LATAM.

ZURICH/FRANKFURT (Reuters) -  Siemens  (DE:SIEGn) managing board member Michael Sen will no longer take charge of the new energy business which the German engineering group wants to spin off later this year, it said on Thursday, after he agreed to leave the company.
Siemens also announced that longstanding Chief Executive Joe Kaeser would leave the company and be replaced by deputy Chief Executive Roland Busch by early next year at the latest, making official a move that was expected.
Sen had been one of the favourites to succeed 62-year-old Kaeser before he was named CEO designate of the 27 billion euro ($28.84 billion) Siemens Energy business last September.
Michael Patzak, the executive responsible for carving out the energy business from the rest of Siemens and due to be its chief financial officer, will also leave by mutual consent, Siemens said.
The trains to industrial software conglomerate gave no reasons for the departures, although a source told Reuters there had been disagreements about how large a stake Siemens would retain in the new company after the spin-off.
Siemens originally said it would keep less than 50% of the company, but sources told Reuters that Sen wanted Siemens to keep a much smaller stake.
Replacing Sen, Siemens said it was appointing Linde executive Christian Bruch to be the new CEO of the energy business, effective May 1.
Until then it will be led by Tim Holt, the chief operating officer of the gas and power unit.
Maria Ferraro, currently chief financial officer at Siemens digital industries is slated to become chief financial officer at Siemens Energy, the company added.
The spinoff and public listing of Siemens Energy by the end of September 2020 is being pursued on schedule and without change, Siemens said.
The business, which employs 80,000 people, has struggled with collapsing global demand for large gas turbines used to generate electricity as well as cut-throat pricing competition with rivals including  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries.
Siemens also said CEO Kaeser would be named as the chairman of Siemens Energy, ending speculation about his future when his contract expires early next year.
Kaeser, who has led Siemens since 2013, told Siemens's supervisory board he would not seek a contract extension.
The move clears the way for deputy CEO Busch to become chief executive of the Munich-based company.

Busch will take charge no later than Feb 3 2021, and has been given a new five year contract, Siemens said.

978,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 19, 2020 04:25PM ET</span>",World's governments draft manufacturers for virus treatment arsenal,"By Sarah Young, Costas Pitas, Giulio Piovaccari and Elvira Pollina
LONDON/MILAN (Reuters) - From Washington to London, Beijing to Rome, governments are drafting automakers and aerospace manufacturers to ramp up production of ventilators and other medical equipment to bolster what most experts say is an inadequate arsenal of coronavirus treatment tools.
Authorities are hoping large-scale manufacturers can use their low-cost supply chains and digital design expertise, including 3D printing, and repurpose some factories in order to make up the expected shortfall in vital medical hardware. 
Some of Britain's biggest aerospace and car companies have formed three teams to produce basic ventilators to help the country's National Health Service cope with the coronavirus outbreak. 
 Meggitt  (LON:MGGT) Plc, which builds components including oxygen systems for civil aerospace and military fighter programs, is leading one consortium alongside engineers GKN (LON:GKN), Thales SA and Renishaw Plc. 
The other two teams are being led by carmakers McLaren, which is looking at how to design a simple version of a ventilator, and Nissan Motor Co, which is working with others to support existing ventilator producers. 
Ventilators, machines which move air in and out of the lungs, could be the difference between life and death for coronavirus patients suffering breathing difficulties. 
But getting new production up to speed will not be easy, some in the manufacturing industry said. 
“Precision milling and 3D printing techniques could help manufacture complex parts,"" said Rene-Christopher Wollmann, program and platform director at Automobili Pininfarina, which uses virtual design software to build electric hypercars. 
""But this depends on how much know-how existing manufacturers (of ventilators) are prepared to share about the design of such a machine,"" he added. ""Another bottleneck will be assembling such machines under conditions which are adequate for the medical industry."" 
MADE IN CHINA 
The idea of using automakers to supply medical equipment got started in China, where electric car maker BYD earlier this month began turning out 5 million face masks and 300,000 bottles of hand sanitizer a day. The Shenzhen-based automaker is backed by U.S. investor Warren Buffett. 
Since then the idea has spread to other industries and countries. 
European aerospace group Airbus is working across its processes to see if its 3D printing or production facilities can be of use.
""The aim is for there to be a (ventilator) prototype in two weeks and for manufacturing to start in four weeks,"" one person familiar with the situation at the company said.
In northern Italy, the epicenter of the virus outbreak outside China, Italian carmakers Ferrari and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV are in talks with the nation's biggest ventilator manufacturer to help it boost production, company officials said on Thursday.
The Italian government has embarked on a big expansion of intensive care beds, many of which will require ventilators. 
A source familiar with the matter said sports car maker  Ferrari NV  (NYSE:RACE) would be ready to start manufacturing ventilator parts in its famous Maranello headquarters, close to a ventilator factory operated by small medical equipment maker Siare Engineering. The luxury carmaker had yet to make a final decision.
""We're talking to Fiat Chrysler, with Ferrari and (component maker) Marelli to try to understand if they can lend us a hand in this process for the electronics part,"" Siare Engineering Chief Executive Gianluca Preziosa told Reuters. 
Siare could also benefit from the automakers' purchasing power, Preziosa said.
A spokesman for Exor NV, parent firm of both Fiat Chrysler and Ferrari, said meetings had taken place on Thursday with Siare to study the feasibility of the idea and that a decision was expected shortly.
The spokesman said two main options were being considered: help Siare to engineer a capacity increase at its plant with the support of technicians provided by Fiat Chrysler and Ferrari; or outsource production of ventilator parts to the carmakers' facilities.
DETROIT TO THE RESCUE 
In the United States, the federal government is in talks with Detroit auto giants General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) and Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co about how they can help expand ventilator production, the companies and White House officials said on Wednesday.
It would not be the first time Detroit retooled auto plants to confront a national crisis. During World War Two Ford, GM and the former Chrysler stopped building cars and directed their factories and engineers to mass-produce airplanes, tanks and other weaponry at unprecedented levels, earning Detroit the nickname the ""Arsenal of Democracy.""
On Wednesday, U.S. President Donald Trump said he would invoke the Defense Production Act, a law dating back to the Korean War of the 1950s which grants the president broad authority to ""expedite and expand the supply of resources from the U.S. industrial base,"" which could allow the government to speed production of masks, respirators, ventilators and other needed equipment.
Ford CEO Jim Hackett told employees in a town hall meeting that Ford is working on building ventilators if the idea is feasible. GM CEO Mary Barra spoke to White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow about the issue after the company announced it would suspend North American production through March 30. 
Separately, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk used his Twitter account to offer his company's services.

""We will make ventilators if there is a shortage,"" Musk tweeted, responding to a suggestion that the billionaire repurpose a factory for the task. The comment immediately drew hundreds of replies urging him to act.

983,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 19, 2020 03:15PM ET</span>",Swedish FSA slaps record $386 million fine on Swedbank over money laundering breaches,"By Colm Fulton, Johan Ahlander and Simon Johnson
STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Sweden's financial watchdog hit lender  Swedbank  (ST:SWEDa) with a record fine of 4 billion Swedish crowns ($386 million) on Thursday for serious deficiencies in its management of money laundering risks in its Baltic operations.
Sweden's oldest retail bank saw its share price collapse by a third last year after details of the dirty money scandal -- which also engulfed Danish peer  Danske Bank  (CO:DANSKE) -- emerged at the end of 2018 and through 2019, forcing it to fire its CEO and much of its board.
""Our investigation shows that the Swedish management did not efficiently address the risk of money laundering in the Baltics,"" FSA Director General Erik Theden said in a statement.
""It is also deeply concerning that the bank on a number of occasions withheld information from (the FSA) that would have revealed the seriousness and scope of the problems.""
Estonia's FSA financial watchdog said in a simultaneous statement following their joint investigation that a criminal inquiry in Estonia will now determine whether money laundering had taken place.
Swedbank was alleged to have processed suspect gross transactions of up to 20 billion euros ($22 billion) a year from mostly Russian non-residents through Estonia from 2010 to 2016.
""The bank's awareness of the risk of money laundering and its processes, routines and control systems were insufficient,"" the FSA said. ""The Baltic operations were also lacking adequate resources to combat money laundering.""
The penalty exceeds the bar set in 2015 when the FSA hit lender Nordea with a fine of 50 million Swedish crowns ($4.83 million), which was the maximum allowed at the time.
Swedbank remains under investigation in the United States and Estonia. Last week, Swedbank said an internal investigation by its law firm found that transactions totaling $4.8 million potentially violated U.S. sanctions.
Analysts said that in terms of the potential U.S sanction breaches, the total amount of suspect transactions was fairly small. 
Violating U.S sanctions can lead to significant fines. French lender  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) paid a $8.9 billion settlement in 2015 to resolve claims it committed major violations of sanctions imposed on Sudan, Cuba and Iran.
Swedbank entered the Baltics in the 1990s after the fall of the Soviet Union and it is now the biggest bank in Estonia in terms of market share for services such as deposits and lending.
The lender had to sign up for a Swedish state aid scheme during the financial crisis as loan losses in its Baltic operations threatened to bring the bank down.
""The fine comes in slightly below expectations. I haven't seen anything in the FSA's statement so far that makes me more concerned ... so I think we can start to move on,"" said Andreas Hakansson, an analyst at Danske Bank.

985,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 19, 2020 03:10PM ET</span>","Bond investors remain thirsty, despite Fed liquidity efforts","By David Henry, Ross Kerber and John McCrank
NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. regulators have poured trillions of dollars into bond markets over the past week and eased rules on big banks to grease transactions during the coronavirus panic.
Unfortunately, money can't buy liquidity.
Investors say they have been experiencing problems not just in esoteric debt instruments, but even in areas that are usually easy to trade, like 10-Year Treasury notes. (US10YT=RR)
The strain is being caused by regulations imposed since the 2008 financial crisis, operational issues with many trading staff working remotely, and everyone trying to sell the same things at once, industry sources said.
One result is that prices can move unpredictably, making it hard for firms to handle trades that once seemed ordinary. 
Mary Ann Hurley, vice president for fixed-income trading at D.A. Davidson in Seattle, said the situation can resemble a grocery store customer staring at a shelf of aging bottles of milk. “It’s forcing you to buy something very close to the expiration date,” she said.
Liquidity is measured by the gap between what sellers say they want to receive for securities and what buyers say they will pay - known as the bid-ask spread - as well as the size of the trades. Bid-ask spreads have gotten wider while order sizes have shrunk, several bond analysts told Reuters.
""There's not enough flow,"" said Jim Vogel, interest-rate strategist for FHN Financial.
Lately, Vogel has found himself scrutinizing the last five or six trades to figure out where Treasury bonds are headed. Essentially investors have limited visibility in what is usually the most liquid market in the world.
""That's a form of illiquidity and part of the stay-alive mentality that we have seen across all capital markets since February 24th,"" he said.
THIRST NOT QUENCHED
Statistics from Quantitative Brokers, which provides traders with algorithms and analytics, show average quote sizes in 10-year Treasury futures dropping from roughly 1,500 lots - each lot is for a $100,000 contract - at the beginning of January to around 100 lots just before the U.S. Federal Reserve announced its first set of liquidity measures in early March.
Altogether, the Fed has been offering $1 trillion each day to support overnight lending markets, has said it is purchasing at least $500 billion in Treasury securities to support market functioning and has established liquidity facilities for commercial paper markets, money-market funds and primary dealers.  
The Fed has also targeted dollar-funding markets in coordination with a group of other central banks, slashed interest rates to a range of zero to 0.25% from 1.5% to 1.75%, and eased capital and liquidity rules on major banks to keep credit moving through the system.
Even with all of that, quote sizes for 10-year Treasury futures have only crept up to 175 lots per trade - far off the average from the start of the year, according to Quantitative Brokers.
Cash Treasury markets have tightened similarly, and not improved at all with the Fed's announcements, said Shankar Narayanan, the firm's head of trading research.
One fund manager said his firm often sends out lists of 100 different bonds each day to see what prices come back from dealers. It typically gets 85-90% of those requests filled at satisfactory prices, but the portion has dropped to 25% with good counterparties, and 0-15% with less reliable counterparties, said the manager, one of a few who was not authorized to speak to the press.
Financial industry trade groups have long complained that because of increased capital requirements imposed by regulators following the 2008 financial crisis, banks have chosen to carry smaller inventories of bonds, making it harder for investors to find counterparties to take their trades.
Although major dealers housed inside regulated banks like JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM), Bank of America Corp (N:BAC),  Citigroup  Inc (N:C),  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS) and  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS) have been able to tap emergency Fed facilities, non-bank dealers without that access have been even more cautious in filling trades, some sources said.
Smaller dealers typically account for some 30-40% of bond-market activity, according to a March 10 report by JPMorgan fixed-income analysts.
The widest price differentials and most unusual volatility has been happening in corporate bonds and inflation-linked Treasury securities, said another fixed-income manager.
In some cases, corporate bonds have a bid or an offer, but not both at the same time, so trades cannot happen, he said.
Operational issues are fueling problems, he said, as big portions of staff are working remotely to prevent coronavirus from spreading. The disease has so far infected over 234,00 people globally, more than 9,000 of whom have died, according to Reuters' internal tracker https://graphics.reuters.com/CHINA-HEALTH-MAP/0100B59S39E/index.html.
Even his own firm - a major investment house - has experienced issues with servers going down in one region and traders having to switch to servers elsewhere in the world.
Although the Fed has done a lot to improve conditions for banks and major companies that are cash-strapped, it has still been chaotic, he said.

""It hasn't made things better,"" he said. ""This is as bad as 2008.""

987,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 19, 2020 02:50PM ET</span>","Potential coronavirus treatment touted by Trump already in shortage, pharmacists say","By Michael Erman
NEW YORK (Reuters) - An old malaria treatment that has been tried with some success against the new coronavirus and was touted by U.S. President Donald Trump at a news briefing earlier on Thursday is in short supply as demand surges amid the fast-spreading outbreak.
The American Society of Health-System Pharmacists (ASHP), which maintains a list of drugs in shortage independent of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's list, added the generic malaria drug hydroxychloroquine to its list on Thursday. Four out of eight manufacturers of the drug are currently in shortage, it said. 
The new coronavirus, which causes the highly contagious COVID-19 respiratory illness, emerged in December in Wuhan, China and has spread throughout the world.
There are currently no vaccines or treatments approved for the disease, but researchers are studying existing treatments and working on experimental ones. At the moment, most patients can only receive supportive care.
Erin Fox, senior director of drug information at University of Utah Health, who maintains ASHP's shortages list, said pharmacists are unable to get the drug or fill prescriptions in full.
Fox said that University of Utah's 12 retail pharmacies are not filling prescriptions for prophylactic use, and are preserving their stocks for inpatient needs.
The FDA could not be reached for comment, but hydroxychloroquine is not currently on its drugs in shortage list.
Trump called on U.S. health regulators to expedite potential therapies aimed at treating COVID-19, including hydroxychloroquine.
""We're going to be able to make that drug available almost immediately,"" Trump said of the malaria drug at a White House briefing.
RUN ON PHARMACIES
Fox and the FDA have been watching for drug shortages that could be due to supply chain issues with manufacturing in China and India. But surging demand in recent weeks is the issue with the malaria drug, which can also treat rheumatoid arthritis and lupus, according to online pharmacy, Honeybee Health.
Its co-Chief Executive Jessica Nouhavandi sent a letter to prescribers earlier this week, urging them to be aware of potential hoarding of the drug that could deprives those who really need it.
On Thursday, Nouhavandi said demand was its highest yet after Trump's comments.
Jeff Bartone, who owns Hock's Pharmacy in Vandalia, Ohio, said he purchased five bottles of hydroxychloroquine this morning, but within an hour the company that distributes it to his pharmacy had run out.
He said four backup prescription drug wholesalers were out of the drug as well.
Bartone said he does not typically stock large amounts of the drug because it is not widely prescribed.
Mylan NV (O:MYL) - one of the manufacturers ASHP said was in shortage - said it was ramping up production of the drug and expects to be in a position to begin supplying it more broadly in mid-April.
It said with the raw materials on hand it can make 50 million tablets to potentially treat more than 1.5 million patients.
 Bayer AG  (DE:BAYGn) said it would donate 3 million tablets of Resochin - a closely related drug known generically as chloroquine phosphate. Chloroquine is also in shortage, according to the ASHP. 
Online pharmacy Valisure said it too was unable to order any chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine as of Thursday from its four distributors.
Valisure Chief Executive David Light said other potential treatments are also becoming difficult to obtain.
""Kaletra and losartan are being rationed, meaning we are only allowed to order limited quantities at a time,"" he said.
Kaletra, a combination HIV treatment sold by AbbVie (N:ABBN), and the generic blood pressure drug losartan have been considered as potential treatments for the virus, although Chinese investigators reported this week that Kaletra failed to improve outcomes for seriously ill COVID-19 patients.

991,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 19, 2020 02:29PM ET</span>",Senate Working at ‘Warp Speed’ To Draft Stimulus by Thursday,"(Bloomberg) -- Congressional leaders raced to draft legislation by Thursday for the next virus-related economic rescue plan that could exceed the size and scope of the emergency measures taken during the 2008 financial crisis.
Soaring layoffs, plunging markets and shuttered schools, shops and factories caused by the coronavirus outbreak have sparked a sense of urgency in Congress and at the White House.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who was largely a bystander as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin worked out an initial economic relief package, asked the Senate to work at “warp speed” on a $1.3 trillion package.
McConnell on the Senate floor Thursday outlined four major areas of relief: checks to everyone from “the middle class on down,” payments to small businesses so they can make payroll, loans to strategically important industries like airlines, and a health care surge to tackle the virus itself.
While Senate Republicans are working in three groups to craft legislation in line with the White House’s request, Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer offered his own proposal and said he has spoken with Mnuchin several times about what the package will need to win approval in a divided Congress. Pelosi also expects to see a draft of the plan on Thursday, according to a Democratic aide.
North Dakota Senator Kevin Cramer, a Republican on the Banking Committee, said the process has been fast and inclusive as lawmakers rush to prop up an economy brought to a halt by the global health crisis.
“It sounds like we will” see the stimulus package by Thursday night, Cramer said. “We’ll be doing a world record speed for this place.”
This broader package of fiscal stimulus follows a virus-related House bill that the Senate passed 90-8 Wednesday and President Donald Trump signed into law. The strong bipartisan vote showed a rare level of unity in a Washington riven by partisan divides with a backdrop of a bitter fight for the Senate and the White House this fall.
With both parties embracing the next round of virus relief climbing into the trillions of dollars, there are few concerns about the spending level, or adding to a budget deficit already set to hit $1 trillion this year.
“If you don’t pay now, you pay later,” said South Carolina Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, who in 2009 voted against the $800 billion stimulus plan that was the Obama administration’s response to the financial crisis.
Providing Medical Supplies
Although there is a collective agreement in Congress on the need for bold action, there are different ideas about what that means.
In addition to Schumer’s proposal, Pelosi spoke to committee chairmen and leadership in a conference call Wednesday afternoon to discuss their own plans, according to a person on the call. She’s due to talk to House Democrats in a call Thursday.
Schumer, in an interview with MSNBC on Thursday, called for a “Marshall Plan” for the health-care industry as part of the package to help provide more ventilators, hospital beds and other supplies to handle the expected influx of coronavirus victims.
Schumer, who said he would be meeting with McConnell about the next stimulus package, said he will also be advocating “massively expanding unemployment insurance” and “putting workers first” in any plans for industry bailouts, including barring the use of funds to buyback shares and raise corporate salaries.
“We need to have the workers getting paid,” Schumer said.
Schumer and Pelosi want to immediately start bipartisan talks among congressional leaders to speed final passage of a bill, but McConnell first wants to get agreement among his own GOP troops and the administration.
Several senators said Wednesday they hope a bill could be passed this weekend, and McConnell urged senators to stay close by. He warned he would not send the Senate home until they pass it. The House is on recess this week, so any final package is still a ways away from reaching Trump’s desk.
“We’re getting close,” McConnell said of a GOP proposal. “We’re working along and hope to be together shortly.”
Direct Payments
There are about four or five different buckets of stimulus under consideration, including aid for small businesses, funding for health care and the virus response, stimulus checks and assorted other aid for individuals, aid to state and local governments, and large low-cost loans for larger businesses like airlines.
The centerpiece of the White House plan is $500 billion in payments to individuals -- replacing Trump’s widely panned proposal for a payroll tax holiday. The idea faces resistance from some of Trump’s top allies like Graham, who don’t like the idea of sending everyone a check and would prefer a combination of unemployment insurance and aid to businesses to keep people employed during the crisis.
Democratic Senator Joe Manchin also questioned broad-based direct payments to individuals.
“Don’t you think we should be directing this to people who are out of a job and don’t have anything because we told them to go home?” said Manchin, of West Virginia.
But Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri said his fellow Republicans will be closely following the Treasury proposal in drawing up the legislation. “I particularly like the piece about direct assistance to individuals and families,” he said.
Senators who back the idea of direct payments also have different views on whether everyone should get the same amount, or whether it should be targeted to lower-income people or workers most impacted by the virus, such as health workers who risk contracting the virus and must find emergency child care for their children who are home from school.
Financial Services Chairwoman Maxine Waters, a California Democrat, proposed having the Federal Reserve send at least $2,000 per month to adults and $1,000 per child, an idea that would cost more than $1 trillion on its own if the crisis extended for just two months. She also proposed giving small businesses a 100% payroll tax rebate, and doubling it in virus hot spots.
Small Business Loans
Small business assistance has widespread bipartisan support, but exactly which form it will take is still to be negotiated.
GOP Senators Susan Collins and Marco Rubio said they are drafting language that would funnel about $300 billion to small businesses to cover their payroll and other expenses retroactive to March 1, provided they don’t lay anyone off or use the money for things like boosting profits.
Under their outline, small businesses would get federally guaranteed loans that would be forgiven if they comply with the requirements.
“We want to make sure that businesses that otherwise would be thriving and doing well make it through this pandemic,” Collins said.
The outbreak is hitting directly in Congress. Several lawmakers have put themselves in self-quarantine after potential exposure. On Wednesday, Representatives Mario Diaz-Balart, a Florida Republican, and Ben McAdams, a Utah Democrat, became the first two members of Congress known to test positive for the novel coronavirus.
Diaz-Balart said in a statement that he developed symptoms on Saturday and received notice that he tested positive. He has remained in his Washington apartment since feeling ill.
“It is important that everyone take this extremely seriously and follow CDC guidelines in order to avoid getting sick and mitigate the spread of this virus,” he said. “We must continue to work together to emerge stronger as a country during these trying times.”

NEW YORK/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) has started asking customers to cooperate with a Department of Justice criminal investigation of third-party sellers on its e-commerce marketplace, according to an email seen by Reuters.
The company is informing customers, who may have purchased products from such sellers, according to the email sent by Joell Parks, a senior law enforcement response specialist at Amazon.
It was not immediately clear if the probe is tied to sellers taking advantage of the spreading coronavirus and engaging in price gouging on the retailer's platform.
In recent weeks, Amazon has come under pressure from lawmakers to nab such sellers. 
On Wednesday, four lawmakers, including House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler and David Cicilline, antitrust subcommittee chairman, sent a letter to the Justice Department asking the agency to investigate the matter. 
Earlier this month, the company said it is working with state attorneys general to identify and prosecute such third-party sellers and has restricted the type of merchants who can sell health and sanitation items on its website. https://reut.rs/2x9dQul
""We wanted to notify you directly about this matter in the event that you are contacted by the Department of Justice in connection with its investigation,"" Parks said in his email, which was sent to a Reuters editor who is also an Amazon customer.
Despite these steps, consumer advocacy groups said they have spotted listings of essential items with unusual price spikes on the website.
It was also not clear if the probe would deal with more than two dozen people who were charged in a federal court in Dallas for being part of a crime ring in which thieves shoplifted goods from stores across the United States and sold them on Amazon.

The company did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

LONDON (Reuters) - In calm markets ""quadruple witching"" usually passes unnoticed, but some market players are hoping this Friday's concurrent quarterly expiration of U.S. options and futures contracts could shake some sense back into stocks.
The expiration of stock options, stock index futures and index option contracts on the same day on the third Friday of the last month each quarter usually heralds hectic trading and volatility as investors unwind old positions and take new ones.
But after one of the most violent sell-offs in stock market history, some traders say those expiries may bring some relief as a large number of short positions rolling off could ease some of the recent selling pressure.
A build-up in index futures contracts to multi-year highs before the sell-off has meant investors have become more sensitive to the move in market prices and the impact on these underlying contracts.
For example, the open interest on March expiries of the popular S&P 500 futures contract stands at its highest level in three years, indicating that leveraged bets on U.S. stocks have ramped up rapidly in recent months.
While those positions can be rolled over or unwound smoothly in calm markets, this can become very difficult in volatile markets where the average move of the daily stock index is above 2.5%, its biggest since the 2008 global financial crisis.
That makes it difficult for traders whose job is to ensure that the sensitivity of the price of a derivative to a change in the underlying market has a relationship of one or ""delta one"" as they have to trade stocks in large quantities to ensure the relationship holds.
Market analysts expect about 40% of the expected price swings to roll over in the quadruple witching hours and that should bring some calm to markets.
""Potentially this cleaner dealer positioning may lead to less drastic market swings,"" one trader said.
But some market watchers like Marija Veitmane, a multi-asset strategist at  State Street  (NYSE:STT) Global Market say it is still too early to say whether markets have bottomed as an internal index of market fragility is still at extreme highs.

""The market is extremely narrow and panic driven, so I suspect those wild moves will stay with us for some time,"" Veitmane said.

1007,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 19, 2020 12:45PM ET</span>","Tumbling pound, virus strategy, Brexit fears lead to heavy slide in UK domestic stocks","By Julien Ponthus and Thyagaraju Adinarayan
LONDON (Reuters) - A falling currency, doubts about the UK government's response to the coronavirus crisis and fresh fears of leaving the European Union without a trade deal are prompting investors to ditch shares of companies exposed to the local economy.
The FTSE 250 index (FTMC), home to mid-sized UK stocks, has sharply underperformed British blue chips and other major European bourses since the coronavirus broke out.
The index has fallen by 43% from its Feb. 19 peak, compared with a 33% drop for the FTSE 100 index (FTSE) and 36% for the pan-European STOXX 600.
The losses are also a bit sharper than in France, Italy and Spain, which have already implemented extreme measures such as entire city lockdowns.
This trend could be seen on Thursday as well: By mid-afternoon the FTSE 250 was down 3.5% while most European bourses and the FTSE 100 were in positive territory.
Some market commentators believe the fall is partially attributable to the UK's response to the crisis.
""Initially markets were more concerned about the effect of the virus on economies outside the UK, but the implementation of more stringent containment measures in the UK over the last week has made clear that the domestic economy will also take a hit,"" said Mike Bell, global market strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management.
Joshua Mahony, senior market analyst at IG, wrote to his clients on Monday that investors had doubts about the government's strategy.
TRIPLE WHAMMY
""With the domestically focused FTSE 250 being hit hard this morning, there is clearly a perception within the trading community that the UK strategy is riskier and could result in a more significant economic impact despite the current lack of a hardline shutdown seen elsewhere"".
Some well-known names such as bus operator  National Express  (L:NEX),  Restaurant Group  (L:RTN), pub operators  Mitchells & Butlers  (L:MAB) and Marston's (L:MARS) have now all lost more than two-thirds of their value this week alone.
""A number of mid-caps have also issued downbeat earnings outlook statements this week and in some cases canceled planned dividend payments, which has added to shareholders’ woes,"" AJ Bell Investment Director Russ Mould said.
The consensus view is that it's a triple whammy: the virus response, faltering sterling and the never-ending Brexit saga.
""Concerns of a no trade deal Brexit are resurfacing as the June deadline to extend is approaching while UK and EU negotiations appear to have made little progress"", said Emmanuel Cau Head of European Equity Strategy at  Barclays  (LON:BARC).
The weakness is also a ripple-effect of the falling pound, which hit lows on Wednesday not seen since 1985 and exacerbates the spread between the FTSE 100 and the FTSE 250.

""It’s been quite an extreme drop in the currency, and with so much of the revenue in the FTSE 100 coming from outside of the UK, the weaker currency is often a supportive factor"", argued Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at Oanda.

1008,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 19, 2020 12:32PM ET</span>",Stocks - Dow Gains as Trump Details Potential Therapies to Combat Covid-19,"By Yasin Ebrahim 
Investing.com – The Dow rose Thursday after President Donald Trump detailed a range of therapies that could be used to treat the Covid-19 virus.   
The Dow jumped 1.60%, theS&P 500 rose 1.15% and the Nasdaq Composite added 3,07%.
 Trump said the Food and Drug Administration had approved severe arthritis and malaria drugs, hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine respectively, for use against the coronavirus, which has infected as many as 10,755 in the U.S.
The approved therapies will help bide time for health professionals who are in a race against time to find a potential vaccine, which some say could take up to 18 months before becoming publicly available.
With the economy expected to take a hit from the virus outbreak, corporations have been urged to hold off stock buybacks to preserve their balance sheets. The move has been backed by Trump, who said he OK with imposing a ban on stock buybacks as a condition for companies to receive bailouts.
Energy clawed back some of its losses from a day earlier as oil prices bounced back strongly as traders continue to assess whether stimulus efforts will help ease the impact from the virus outbreak.
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said earlier that the White House’s stimulus plans would include $500 billion for direct payments to Americans -- $1,000 per person and $500 per child."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Banks should immediately halt share buybacks, dividends and most staff bonuses to bolster capital and increase the capacity to lend to the real economy, a group of former senior regulators said in a statement to G20 finance ministers and central bankers on Thursday.
The Systemic Risk Council (SRC), a non-partisan body which comprises a number of officials who navigated the financial system through the 2008 crisis, said regulators should also require banks to gradually de-leverage their trading books and unwind deals, such as swaps and securities-lending portfolios, that do not support the real economy.
The statement to finance leaders in the Group of 20 industrialized economies was issued amid a scramble for dollar liquidity globally as businesses suffer revenue hits from disruption caused by the spreading coronavirus outbreak.
""Weaknesses in the financial system are exacerbating the potential feedback loops, which risk deepening the downturn and impeding eventual economic recovery,"" the group wrote, pointing to a massive rise in corporate leverage and liquidity mismatches in the non-bank lending sector.
On Sunday, the largest eight US banks announced they had suspended stock buyback programs at least through the end of June as they redeploy capital to support the US economy in the face of a widening health crisis, although the Wall Street giants did not comment on dividends or remuneration. [L1N2B95JV]
The SRC also repeated criticisms of deregulatory measures taken by the Trump administration and other governments in the world, to reduce bank equity and liquidity requirements, saying those efforts should be immediately suspended.
The Council, which includes Sir Paul Tucker, a former deputy governor of the Bank of England, and Jean-Claude Trichet, a former president of the European Central Bank, also added to calls for central banks to provide direct liquidity to businesses hurt by business disruption. [L4N2BA5HN]

The group also recommended that authorities widen the collateral used in their longer-term market operations, such as in repurchase agreements, prepare to act as market makers of last resort in capital markets and where necessary conduct wider outright purchases of private securities.

1011,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 19, 2020 12:00PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Moody's readying for mass global downgrade of virus-hit firms,"By Marc Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - Credit rating agency Moody's is carrying out a global review of its corporate ratings in light of the coronavirus and oil price slump, with a first mass wave of downgrades or downgrade warnings likely in the coming days.
The firm has already begun the process in a number of the hardest hit sectors such as airlines, cruise and oil firms, but the moves are about to ratchet up, two of the firm's top analysts told Reuters.
""We are undertaking a global review of ratings that are impacted by the virus,"" Managing Director of Global Strategy & Research Anne Van Praagh and Christina Padgett, Associate Managing Director of Corporate Finance Research, said in an interview.
""By the end of the week we will have a fair amount of rating actions,"" Van Praagh added, saying it was likely to impact whole groups of companies or sectors all being impacted in the same way.
Earlier this week Moody's said that about 9% of the 920 companies it rated in Europe, the Middle East and Africa had a ""high exposure"" to the effects of the coronavirus outbreak, with another 54% having moderate exposure.
It also estimated that about 16% of the more than 2,000 companies it rates in North America would be at high risk of rating move under the now widely expected scenario of a global recession.
""We have the virus, the big fall in commodity prices and now (the pressure in) the capital markets. This combination of events is unprecedented, so we have to come at it from several different angles,"" Padgett said.
The first flurry of downgrades could take a few weeks. As well as sectors like airlines, oil and gas and travel, shipping, hotels and entertainment and leisure will all be heavily impacted too. 
Firms with weaker finances already in the junk grade, of high yield category as it is also potentially see multi-notch downgrades, while on the flip side government support, if strong enough, could potentially spare others.

Under the initiative, first used in the 2008 financial crisis but now extended again to help cushion the blow from the coronavirus, companies can apply for state aid to cover the costs of keeping people on.
Germany expects the short-time work scheme, known as Kurzarbeit, to cost the labor office roughly 10 billion euros ($10.8 billion), the draft regulation from the labor ministry showed.
The Federal Labour Office has accumulated record-high financial reserves of roughly 26 billion euros, which can be used to finance Kurzarbeit state aid.

Business daily Handelsblatt had earlier reported that Germany expected nearly 2.2 million people to go onto shorter hours, including 1.15 million due to the coronavirus.

BOSTON (Reuters) - One of the most aggressive state-run cash pools that regularly trounces the returns of peers and money-market funds with big bets on short-term corporate debt is no longer eager to buy some of the blue-chip names that produce those juicy yields.
Before the coronavirus pandemic reverberated around the globe and created a financial panic on Wall Street, the Utah Public Treasurers’ Investment Fund had about 95% of its $17.5 billion in assets invested in corporate debt and commercial paper issued by blue-chip companies. ExxonMobil Corp (N:XOM), hard hit by a price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia, accounted for about $638 million, or 3.6% of the fund's assets.  Chevron  Corp's (N:CVX) total was about $8 million, state disclosures show.
Graphic: Oil demand slumps in first quarter 2020, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/ce/7/9010/8991/oil%20slump.png
""We will let those positions roll off,"" Utah Treasurer David Damschen said Wednesday in an email. ""There are no plans to buy into the energy sector at present.""
Damschen and other state treasurers said they anticipate increased cash demands from their investors, which include small towns and library districts, for example.
""The primary concern right now is the unknown length and magnitude of the economic impact to the household and business sectors caused by the virus, the office of Washington state Treasurer Duane Davidson said. ""This is different than the (previous) financial crisis where the primary concern was the soundness of the financial system.""
The U.S. Federal Reserve this week dusted off its playbook from the 2008-2009 financial crisis to prevent the corporate debt market from seizing up. The Fed took the extraordinary step of saying it would prop up the corporate debt market by buying commercial paper directly from banks and large corporations and dish out short-term cash in return. [nL1N2BA0PK]
With nearly $300 billion, local government investment pools (LGIPs) across the United States invest the idle taxpayer dollars collected for school districts, small towns and cities in U.S. Treasuries, municipal bonds, bank certificates of deposit and corporates. The pools provide economies of scale that can produce significant savings in money management fees to participants.
Another goal is to stretch taxpayer dollars by generating more income than participants would in money-market funds. New Mexico's $1 billion LGIP has doubled in size over the past five years, with yields that are 15 to 20 basis points more than a similarly structured money fund.
Many of the pools follow the same investment rules of money-market funds. Others, like the Utah fund and the Oregon Short-Term Fund, have mandates that allow them to take more risk by allocating a higher percentage of assets toward corporate issues.
Over the past several years, corporate debt has juiced the Utah fund's returns, which have ranked the highest or among the highest in the country. In 2019, for example, the fund's average yield of 2.76% was No. 1 among LGIPs, according to research firm Tracs Financial. By contrast, the average money-market fund yield was 1.86%, according to Refinitiv Lipper data.
Though highly rated, corporate debt carries more credit risk, and pays higher yields, than bonds issued by the U.S. government and its various agencies. The current yield on Exxon AA-rated commercial paper that matures in early September is 1.4%, compared to 0.08% on a benchmark 6-month U.S. Treasury note (US6MT=RR).
Pete Crane, president of money-market research firm Crane Data, said LGIPs typically are stalwarts in the corporate debt market, though not the biggest buyers.
""They are a lot less headline sensitive, and they are much more hungry for yield,"" Crane said.

Investing.com - U.S. stock markets opened lower again on Thursday, albeit selling was more moderate than on Wednesday after moves by U.S. government, Federal Reserve and global central banks all helped to relieve some of the immediate liquidity stress in financial markets across the world.
Neither fiscal nor monetary stimulus measures are currently able to outweigh the increasing signs of a sharp economic slowdown. U.S. initial jobless claims skyrocketed to 280,000 last week to their highest in two and a half years.
By 09:33 AM ET (1333 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 404 points or 2.03%. The S&P 500 was down 1.8% and the Nasdaq Composite was down 0.7%.
The Dow had hit fallen 6.3% on Wednesday to its lowest level since December 2016 amid widespread distressed selling of a kind hardly seen since the 2008/9 financial crisis.
The market was supported by a bounce in oil prices, as U.S. crude futures rebounded from extremely oversold levels. There was, however, no news to suggest an early end to the price war that broke out earlier in the month with the collapse of the OPEC+ deal on output restraint.
Among individual stocks, Ford Motor (NYSE:F) rose 0.5% after saying it was drawing down $15.4 billion from two existing credit lines and suspending dividend payments, in an effort to bolster reserves to help it through the coronavirus outbreak. The U.S. number two automaker also pulled its guidance for 2020.
Zoom Video stock rose 6.1% to a new record high as investors again piled into a company that they expect to benefit from an increased trend of working from home.

1029,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 19, 2020 09:25AM ET</span>","Ford hoards cash, withdraws profit forecast amid coronavirus outbreak","By Ben Klayman
DETROIT (Reuters) -  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) on Thursday moved to hoard cash on its balance sheet, drawing down $15.4 billion from two credit lines and suspending its dividend, in a move to bolster reserves to ride out damage to its business from the coronavirus pandemic.
The No. 2 U.S. automaker, whose shares closed off slightly after sinking as much as 8.9% earlier in the day, also abandoned its 2020 financial forecast and said the cash would be used to deal with a squeeze on capital caused by shutdowns in production due to the fast-spreading virus.
The move will give Ford more than $37 billion in cash, almost matching the revenue it reported in the fourth quarter. That dwarfs the company's market capitalization of about $18 billion. 
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analyst Adam Jonas said in a research note that corporate liquidity during the outbreak was ""top of mind"" and that U.S. automakers had strong balance sheets. 
The coronavirus outbreak, which started in China last year, has caused about 219,000 infections and more than 8,900 deaths globally.
Comparing the current economic situation to the 2008-2009 financial crisis, Chief Executive Jim Hackett said Ford was putting in place safeguards to protect its business. 
""We're at war with the virus and Ford is going to win,"" Hackett told employees on a video conference.
Ford has come under fire from some analysts on Wall Street for moving too slowly to cut costs and restructure its business. 
At the end of last year, it had booked only $3.7 billion of the projected $11 billion in charges it previously said it would take in its global restructuring.
Since then, the outbreak has spread globally, leading Ford, General Motors Co (N:GM) and  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles NV (MI:FCHA), (N:FCAU) on Wednesday to announce the shutdown of their North American plants to prevent the spread of the disease among their factory workers.
All three Detroit automakers have seen U.S. employees test positive for COVID-19, the contagious respiratory illness caused by the virus.
Electric carmaker Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) on Thursday suspended production at its California car plant, starting March 24, to help stem the spread of the coronavirus, and added that its cash position was strong enough to navigate this period of uncertainty.
OUTLOOK REVISIONS
The outbreak has already hit other automakers and more are expected to slash their 2020 forecasts. 
Evercore ISI analysts said in a research note that such actions ""will be an ongoing theme in addition to the removal of (stock) buybacks.""
On Wednesday, German luxury automaker BMW AG (DE:BMWG) cut its 2020 profit outlook, saying it would be ""significantly lower"" than last year. Two days before that, Chinese automaker Great Wall Motor Co Ltd (SS:601633) also cut its 2020 sales and profit targets.
GM and FCA did not change their profit forecasts on Thursday.
""We are dedicated to managing our cost structure against this dynamic environment,"" GM said in a statement. ""We continue to monitor the situation closely and will make any necessary decisions to stay resilient.""
GM had $34.6 billion in liquidity at the end of 2019, including $17.3 billion in cash.
""We are evaluating the impact of all steps being taken inside the company related to the coronavirus emergency on our current financial guidance,"" FCA said in a statement, adding it would provide an update when it has ""sufficient visibility on market conditions."" 
FCA had 23.1 billion euros ($24.94 billion) in liquidity at the end of 2019.
Shares of  Uber Technologies Inc  (N:UBER) closed up more than 38% on Thursday after Chief Executive Dara Khosrowshahi said the ride-hailing company had plenty of cash on hand.
""In any crisis, liquidity is key,"" he said on an investor call. 
Ford said on Thursday it notified lenders it would borrow the unused amounts of the two credit lines, totaling $15.4 billion. The Dearborn, Michigan-based company had $22 billion in cash at the end of last year.
The dividend suspension will save Ford money at an annual rate of $2.4 billion. 
The company said it was prioritizing financial flexibility and investments in future technologies such as self-driving cars and a series of important 2020 vehicle launches including a redesigned version of its top-selling F-150 full-size pickup truck.
Ford also withdrew its 2020 profit outlook. In February, before the coronavirus hit the United States, it offered a weaker-than-expected forecast for earnings in the range of 94 cents to $1.20 a share.
Ford said it would update its outlook when it reports first-quarter results on April 28.

Also on Thursday, Ford said it would offer new-car buyers up to six months of payment relief. Some U.S. dealers have begun to see sales drop off because of the virus, which has already drastically hurt demand in other countries.

1030,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 19, 2020 09:20AM ET</span>",How U.S. aluminum recyclers reap dividends from tariffs,"By Pratima Desai
LONDON (Reuters) - North American aluminum recyclers and producers are using import tariffs to boost revenue at the expense of local beer and beverage firms, even though most of the metal used in their cans is not subject to the levy, industry data seen by Reuters show.
Recyclers such as Novelis, a subsidiary of India's Hindalco (NS:HALC), and Japanese-owned Tri-Arrows (T:5741) (T:8053) (T:8001), are charging a duty paid price for aluminum, which at the end of January was more than $180 a tonne above the duty unpaid price, according to data from S&P Global Platts.
Meanwhile, data from consultants Harbor Aluminum shows about 70% of aluminum in the cans used by U.S. drinks firms is recycled locally and free from import taxes, while another 16% comes from domestic and Canadian smelters, which are also exempt from the tariffs.
Harbor also estimates drinks firms paid $582 million more for approximately 3 million tonnes of metal they consumed between March 2018 and December 2019 than they would have if there were no tariffs.
Some $81 million of that went to the U.S. government, while the lion's share of $428 million went to recyclers, which also typically produce the aluminum sheet that companies such as Ball (N:BLL) and Crown (N:CCK) turn into cans.
Aluminum accounts for about 65% of the total costs for U.S. drinks firms.
""Over the last 24 months it has cost both Wis-Pak and its shareholders more than $6 million in increased costs,"" said David Bauer, President of Wis-Pak, a cooperative of family-owned independent Pepsi franchise bottlers.
GLOBAL BENCHMARK
Prices of aluminum in the United States are based on a global benchmark, which is a contract on the London Metal Exchange (LME). Consumers pay the LME price plus the benchmark duty paid Midwest premium, assessed by S&P Global Platts and based on bids, offers and traded prices gathered from traders, consumers and producers. The premium typically covers transport and handling costs and, since March 2018, a 10% tariff on imports of aluminum imposed by the administration of President Donald Trump.
S&P Global Platts also provides an implied duty unpaid premium, which recycling firms, UK-listed  Rio Tinto  (L:RIO) (AX:RIO) and U.S-listed  Alcoa  (N:AA) with smelting facilities in Canada are declining to use.
Local producers such as Century Aluminum (O:CENX), in which London-listed miner  Glencore  (L:GLEN) has a 40% stake, are also declining to use the duty unpaid price.
The duty unpaid premium since S&P Global Platts started to publish it in August 2018 has on average been around $190 a tonne below the duty paid premium, more than 10% of the LME aluminum price currently near $1,600 a tonne.
""There's no premium for the corn and sugar we buy locally to sweeten our products, so why should there be one for aluminum?"" said Kelly Clay, chief executive of Admiral Beverage, the fifth-largest Pepsi bottler in the United States.
Producers in Canada earned $29 million by charging for tariffs they did not pay between March 2018 and July 2019, while local smelters saw a revenue boost of $44 million, according to Harbor's estimates.
Alcoa, Century Aluminum, Tri-Arrows, Ball and Crown did not respond to requests for comment, while Rio and Novelis referred Reuters to the Aluminum Association.
""We are genuinely bewildered by recent attempts to pressure aluminum suppliers to change the pricing methodology that has evolved through market forces ... for more than 25 years,"" said the Aluminum Association's Lauren Wilkes.
U.S. aluminum consumption, mostly in the transport and packaging industries, is estimated to have totaled more than 10 million tonnes last year, about 15% of global demand.
WINDFALL PROFIT
Drinks firms say import levies have changed the environment.
""We met with all our suppliers and asked to pay duty that is reflective of where the aluminum comes from, but we got nowhere,"" Pete Coors, Vice Chairman of Molson Coors, said.
""These firms have monopolistic control to exploit aluminum tariffs and create windfall profit at the expense of end users by raising their prices to match tariff prices.""
Drinks makers want the U.S. system to be reformed so that aluminum producers and recyclers cannot include the cost of tariffs in their prices unless they actually pay them.
But recyclers and producers have declined to do this.
""Unfortunately, we've been left with no other alternative but to request a federal investigation into U.S. aluminum,"" said Admiral Beverage's Kelly.
S&P Global's head of pricing Dave Ernsberger said in response: ""Platts publishes every data point including bids, offers and trades that underlie our assessments for all the market to see and comment on ... our benchmark methodology is transparent.""
To facilitate an investigation, the Aluminum Pricing Examination Act (APEX) sponsored in Congress by Democrat Al Lawson and Republican Ken Buck and in Senate by Republican Cory Gardner and Democrat Tammy Baldwin was introduced last year.
The APEX act would give the Commodity Futures Trading Commission oversight over the benchmark premium.
Former CFTC Chair Christopher Giancarlo said at a hearing last year that users were concerned, but ""not from the point of view of manipulation"", but whether the construction of the Midwest premium was accurate.
Ernsberger said in January ""the CFTC already has the authority to oversee the aluminum market and investigate manipulation"" and that ""the APEX Act is misguided legislation"".
He added that the beer industry ""has failed for over 18 months to provide any evidence of wrongdoing"".

The Aluminum Association's Wilkes said: ""The association is happy to cooperate with any fair and independent government oversight of the industry.""

(Reuters) -  Microsoft Corp 's (O:MSFT) Teams chat and conferencing app gained more than 12 million daily users in one week, a 37.5% jump as more people worked from home during the coronavirus outbreak, the company said on Thursday.
Teams had 44 million users as of March 18, Microsoft said, more than double the 20 million daily active users that the software maker reported in November. Teams users grew from 32 million to 44 million in the period between March 11 and March 18 alone, as many more U.S. companies asked employees to work from home, Microsoft said.
There were no comparable recent numbers for the major rival to Teams, collaboration app  Slack Technologies Inc  (N:WORK), which said in October that it had 12 million daily active users. 
Slack did not update that figure during its earnings announcement on March 12, but said four of its five largest deals in the most recent quarter were won against Microsoft Teams. On Thursday, Slack said it added 7,000 new paid customers from Feb. 1 to March 18, a roughly 40% increase over each of its previous two fiscal quarters, when it had added about 5,000 new paid customers per quarter.
Microsoft also rolled out several features designed to help with telemedicine and working from home, such as a bookings application for Teams to help hospitals manage virtual appointments.
""As organizations around the world are changing the way they work in response to the (coronavirus) situation, we're going to learn a tremendous amount,"" Satya Nadella, Microsoft's chief executive, said in a virtual news conference.
Microsoft charges fees to businesses for its full versions of Teams, but there is a free version that can be used by consumers. 
Microsoft said Thursday that doctors at St. Luke’s University Health Network in Pennsylvania, who had already been using the Teams app, will start tapping it for videoconferencing with patients, including those vulnerable to the novel coronavirus, to protect patients and the hospital. Slack earlier this week said it was making the service free for many organizations working to respond to or mitigate the coronavirus and was speeding up the set-up time for new customers.
Microsoft also said it was working on several new features using artificial intelligence that could make working from home easier for Teams users. 

One feature can automatically replace the background during a video chat, for example cropping out a messy home bedroom and replacing it with a picture of a tidy commercial office. Another feature can filter out background sounds during a conference call, such as the crinkling of a plastic potato chip bag.

1032,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 19, 2020 09:10AM ET</span>",Investor Ackman tweets to Trump: Close down the country,"By Svea Herbst-Bayliss
BOSTON (Reuters) - Billionaire investor William Ackman, who has long worried about risks posed by the coronavirus, called on the Trump administration on Wednesday to seal off the country for 30 days and said stocks would ""soar"" if such restrictions were imposed.
""The only answer is to shut down the country for the next 30 days and close the borders,"" Ackman said in a post on Twitter, adding: ""Tell all Americans that you are putting us on an extended Spring Break at home with family.""
Ackman also said he had bought stock in private equity group Blackstone (NYSE:BX) Group as well as portfolio companies his hedge fund Pershing Square (NYSE:SQ) Capital Management already owns, including Hilton Worldwide Holdings.
Ackman, who has some 58,000 Twitter followers but rarely tweets, took to President Donald Trump's preferred communication platform to publicize his plan for proposed action.
After markets closed with fresh losses and the Dow wiped out the last of its gains put on since Trump was inaugurated, Ackman told Reuters shutting down U.S. borders for 30 days was the only way to limit the virus' spread and save industries on the verge of collapse.
""If President Trump were to go on television, with no one standing next to him, and say that he is shutting everything down and tell people to work from home and stay at home for 30 days, this thing could be killed and markets would soar. It might take some time for markets to recover but I'm confident they would recover fully,"" he said.
Ackman, who normally considers himself an optimist, began worrying about the effects of the virus weeks ago and said he began preparing personally and professionally for a pandemic that he estimated could kill between 1% and 2% of the world's population.
""People need to be scared and take this seriously,"" he said, urging the government to essentially force most Americans to stay home for a month.
Without people wandering around outside, the virus' re-infection rate would be killed, he said, adding ""and then you kill the virus ... 30 days would give us a cushion.""
Ackman protected his portfolio with a hedge that helped turn late February losses into gains in early March. Through March 17, however, the Pershing Square Holdings fund lost ground and is now down 6.5% for the year, data from the hedge fund show.
Ackman broadcast his policy prescription in an emotional interview with CNBC on Wednesday and then again on Twitter.
I am sure ""the president will do the right thing in temporarily shutting down the country and closing the borders. If that happens, we can win the war against the virus,"" Ackman tweeted.
The White House responded by saying that Trump has ensured that all Americans would be taken care of, including affected industries and small businesses, CNBC reported.
Ackman is especially concerned about the hotel, airline, restaurant and auto industries, saying they may not have a long lifeline. 
""Hotels rent rooms for a night and if no one comes, they are done,"" he said. He called Hilton a ""canary in the coal mine,"" and warned that without fast action the hotel industry could tumble to zero.
In addition to buying Blackstone stock, Ackman said he had been loading up on the companies already in his portfolio like Lowe's and Restaurant Brands, as well as Hilton. 
Ackman, who runs $6.5 billion investment firm Pershing Square Capital Management from New York, moved his family, including his father who has battled lung cancer, out of the city several weeks ago.
He said he spends a lot of time thinking about so-called black swan events and began worrying about the coronavirus' potentially catastrophic effects on public health and the economy many weeks ago.

Last year, Ackman's publicly traded hedge fund surged 58%, making it one of the industry's best performers. Earlier this year, he sold off a position in Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) before the coffee chain's stock tumbled some 34% amid warnings for people to avoid restaurants, bars, and coffee shops.

1033,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 19, 2020 09:10AM ET</span>","Already retired, or close to it? How to think about volatility in perilous times","By Mark Miller
CHICAGO (Reuters) - The breathtaking coronavirus-induced plunge of the stock market has unnerved retirement investors of all ages, but it poses special risks for people close to, or already retired. Unlike younger workers with many years ahead of earning and saving, older investors are less able to fall back on income from work and may have less ability to wait out their losses.
How should older investors think about their portfolios now? In one sense, this is the wrong question. A much bigger concern is uncertainty about the resilience of the economy as major sectors grind to a halt as we fight the virus. Still, here are some big-picture thoughts about portfolios from the experts, and some tactical moves to consider.
First, think of the big picture, said Allan Roth, a CFP and head of Wealth Logic in Colorado Springs, Colorado. 
“Markets going down for the last three and a half weeks is statistically rare, but 11 years of a bull market? This is the first time that has happened, so it’s the larger perspective that matters.”
“People are working toward financial independence, and suddenly, the market goes way down in a very fast, shocking manner,” Roth added. “So the natural instinct is not acting out of fear, but to protect what's left - 'I would love to get out of the market now, it would make me feel so much better.' And my logic tells me it's the absolute wrong thing to do.""
And in this moment, it is critical to understand the difference between volatility and risk.
Volatility is what you will always experience from time to time in the stock market. Risk, on the other hand, is about uncertainty, and the fact that we cannot predict the future. And there is risk in any investment.
For example, selling off your portfolio and stuffing your mattress with cash carries the risk that inflation will erode the value of your savings - sharply - over time. If inflation continues at a 2% annual pace, cash will lose half its value over a 25-year period.
REBALANCING
Roth is a big fan of rebalancing your portfolio periodically. This keeps you on track with whatever equity-fixed income allocation you have determined is right for you. But it also can improve returns over time, because it lets you run against the market herd without even thinking about it - when stocks surge, you are selling a bit toward the top of the market; when they drop, you are buying the dip.
Roth calculates that an all-stock portfolio so far this century (through the end of February, using total market index funds, two-thirds U.S. and one-third international) has enjoyed a 4.98% annualized return, while a balanced portfolio (60% stocks, 40% bonds) earned 5.36%.
TARGET ALLOCATIONS 
For retirees, how much of that allocation should go to equities? If you are looking for a proxy on how professional money managers think about that question, look no further than target date funds, which automatically reduce participants’ exposure to stocks as retirement approaches.  Target  (NYSE:TGT) date funds have become dominant favorites in 401(k) plans in recent years, and a growing number of participants are keeping them in retirement, either by staying in their workplace plans or using them in rollover IRAs.
Fidelity Investments' target date series hold 51% equity at the point of retirement - an allocation that the firm decreased by 3.5% two years ago. And last year, it boosted global diversification within the equity portion of its portfolio.
Along with stocks, the funds hold 41% in bonds and 8% in cash equivalents. 
The balance between equities, bonds and cash differs somewhat among the three largest target date fund providers, depending very much on their view of the primary goals for retirees. That reflects a Fidelity view that diversification - including cash - is critical. 
“We think investors at the point of retirement are thinking mainly about the balance of risks that they're likely to experience in the future,” said Andrew Dierdorf, one of Fidelity’s target date fund portfolio managers. “Our goal is to help them maintain their standard of living in retirement.”
That means retired investors will need to achieve returns from equities over the long run, especially since they may well live an additional 20 or 30 years, he notes. But the diminished ability to earn income from work - an income stream that generally behaves like income from bonds would - points to the need for diversification, he adds.
T. Rowe Price has a more aggressive approach. In February, it adjusted the glide path of its retirement funds target date series, with the equities allocation gradually falling to 30% at the end point (30 years after retirement), up from 20% earlier. Investors in this series hold 55% in equities at the initial point of retirement.
The higher equity allocation reflects the saving shortfalls of most investors and rising longevity, notes Wyatt Lee, head of target date strategies for the firm. “We can’t fully invest our way out of a savings problem,” he said. “But by maintaining a reasonable level of growth over the long term, we can continue to help support that income stream - even if it means more short-term volatility.”

1036,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 19, 2020 08:08AM ET</span>",How a Texas oil CEO's luxury land deals cost him his job,"By Liz Hampton
MIDLAND (Reuters) - In July 2018, oilfield service executive Dale Redman took out a loan to buy the Whitehead Ranch - a 20,000-acre cattle and hunting property in central Texas, featuring two luxury homes, livestock barns, and meadows stocked with deer and turkey.
The indulgence fit the lifestyle of a Texas oil tycoon, but the way Redman secured the deal was among a series of missteps that cost him his job. The CEO pledged 230,000 shares of his ProPetro Holding Corp. stock as collateral on the $24.8 million ranch loan - without telling investors - a move the company said violated his agreement to safeguard shareholders as it disclosed Redman's resignation on Monday.
Redman’s ouster came less than three weeks after Reuters sent a letter to Redman and ProPetro directors seeking comment on the ranch loan and other aspects of the CEO’s financial affairs. 
A Reuters examination shows how the self-made oil magnate created myriad conflicts of interest by entangling his personal business interests with those of the company that paid him $15.6 million from 2016 to 2018.
The Reuters findings - based on company documents and interviews with about two dozen former ProPetro employees, law enforcement officials, and vendors - included at least four deals in which ProPetro had awarded business to private ventures owned by Redman. ProPetro also employed three close relatives of Redman and two other executives in highly paid senior positions. Redman also secured a second loan for another ranch by using company stock as collateral, an arrangement that can send a company’s stock value down if an executive is forced to liquidate shares to pay back a loan.
Corporate governance experts said that such practices, while not illegal, are rare at public companies because they create conflicts of interest between executives and the shareholders they serve. 
Redman and a ProPetro spokesperson declined to comment on the issues raised in the Feb. 26 letter from Reuters or on Redman’s resignation.
Reuters reported in October that the SEC was investigating alleged financial irregularities at ProPetro. Since then, the firm’s shares (N:PUMP) have dropped about $9 to $1.5, and the company has delayed filing financial reports with the SEC as it confirms the accuracy of its accounting. The company said this week that it had previously made inaccurate filings because of Redman's failure to disclose that he used shares for loan collateral.
Redman in January sold his Whitehead Ranch and last year put his private jet on the market, according to aviation and real estate sales websites. He also faces investor lawsuits over allegations that he and other ProPetro executives improperly enriched themselves and distributed false information to shareholders.
SAND, LAND, AND A JET
ProPetro was founded in 2005 and has since grown into one of the largest fracking firms in the Permian Basin, the most prolific U.S. oilfield. The company generated $1.7 billion in sales in 2018, growing rapidly by fracking wells for top U.S. shale producers such as  Exxon Mobil  (N:XOM) and  Diamondback Energy Inc  (O:FANG).
Fracking work involves pumping water, chemicals and sand into underground rock formations at high pressure to break up rocks and free deposits of oil and gas inside.
In 2018, ProPetro bought about $10 million worth of sand from a company that mined it on land leased from a firm in which Redman owned a 44% stake, according to a ProPetro SEC filing at the time. The deal netted Redman about $300,000 in royalties, according to the filing.
ProPetro said in the filing that its audit committee had authorized the sand supply deal without Redman's involvement. 
A Reuters examination of other public records revealed that the sand-mining company was named  Covia  Holdings Corp. (N:CVIA), and the oil exploration and production company that leased Covia the land was Redman's Red Hogg LLC.
One of the members of the ProPetro audit committee that approved the deal was director Alan E. Douglas, who had served as an accountant for Red Hogg, according to a Texas business filings. 
Douglas did not respond to a letter requesting comment. Covia declined to comment.
Covia employees who were aware of Redman's involvement in Red Hogg privately expressed reservations about the conflict of interest inherent in the sand supply deal, a former Covia employee said, because it generated income for Redman.
South Midkiff Partners LLC, a company owned by Redman and then-Chief Financial Officer Jeffrey Smith, charged ProPetro at least $420,000 in rent a year under a deal for work properties and equipment yards, company documents show. 
Smith and representatives of South Midkiff did not respond to requests for comment.
Another Redman-owned company, PD Properties, also made $192,000 in 2017 by renting oilfield equipment to ProPetro, and received $72,000 annually in rent for the firm's corporate offices under a five-year deal, according to a 2019 proxy filing.
Redman also rented out his private jet to ProPetro for business trips, receiving nearly $400,000 in 2018 and at least $451,278 in the prior two years combined, ProPetro SEC filings show. 
The company did not disclose the purpose of the trips and did not specify who traveled on Redman's Learjet. Before ProPetro went public, Redman used his plane at least once to reward an oilfield crew by flying them to New Orleans to watch a Saints football game, said a former employee who went on the trip.
While the jet rental payments were disclosed to investors, corporate governance experts called the practice problematic because it raised questions about whether the company had paid market rates. 
FAMILY AFFAIR 
Relatives of Redman and his business partners were employed in high-paying jobs at ProPetro, according to a Reuters review of ProPetro filings.
Redman's son-in-law, for example, worked in sales for ProPetro, and brought home $530,500 in 2018. Former CFO Smith's daughter was the controller, and pulled in $338,800. And the son of the chief operating officer, David Sledge, was its head of investor relations, with compensation of $717,000, according to ProPetro filings. 
The executives and their relatives did not respond to requests for comment made through ProPetro.
In the middle of last year, ProPetro said in an SEC filing it had begun an internal audit of financial controls. Since then many top executives and directors have left or been demoted. On Monday, ProPetro said Redman had resigned and was being replaced as CEO by Phillip Gobe, who had served as an executive and director at several other energy companies, including shale producer  Pioneer Natural Resources  (N:PXD).
'QUEEN OF TEXAS HILL COUNTRY'
Redman started buying ranch land around the time the company went public. State records and bank filings show Redman, beginning in mid-2017, put up as many as 601,200 ProPetro shares – worth more than $8 million at the time - as collateral for two separate loans. The shares accounted for 35% of Redman's holdings in ProPetro.
In the first such deal, with Vista Bank in May 2017, Redman put up 371,200 shares, according to Uniform Commercial Code filings with the Texas Secretary of State. 
The documents did not make clear the loan amount or purpose. But in January 2017, Redman purchased the Preston Ranch in Menard County, Texas, according to local real estate records. The local tax assessor appraised the property at $10.4 million.
A year and a half later, Redman purchased the Whitehead Ranch, after borrowing $24.8 million from West Texas National Bank. That deal was revised to remove the ProPetro shares as collateral two months later, according to the filings.
Redman still owns Preston Ranch, according to county real estate records. But he sold the Whitehead property in January, after advertising it at $30 million.

""The turkey hunting has been called 'second to none',"" according to the real estate listing, which described the property as ""The Queen of the Texas Hill Country.""

1038,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 19, 2020 08:07AM ET</span>",Google critics see its Firebase tools as another squeeze play,"By Paresh Dave
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Some app developers say Alphabet Inc's (O:GOOGL) Google is increasingly pressing them to embed code in their own products that will deepen Google's access to data on consumers, giving the company a leg up on rivals. 
The previously unreported concerns about Firebase, a set of software that Google makes available to apps, have become part of the broad investigations launched last summer by state attorneys general and the United States Department of Justice into whether Google has unlawfully stifled competition in online advertising and other businesses, two people with knowledge of the probes said this month.
The Texas attorney general’s office, which is leading the states’ investigation, and the Justice Department did not respond to requests to comment. 
Google declined to comment beyond generally describing Firebase tools as optional, usable in tandem with competing services and potential revenue-boosters for apps. They spare app makers from coding basic components or having to install alternatives that can be more complex.
Embedded inside apps such as Instacart and  Expedia  (NASDAQ:EXPE), Firebase software plays a big role storing data, delivering notifications, logging glitches and tracking clicks.
Firebase tools give Google, the internet's top ad seller, information on what consumers are doing inside apps that it can exploit to target ads to users, according to makers of Firebase alternatives. 
""It's about data collection and ad serving,"" said Bob Lawson, founder and director of mobile software company Kumulos. ""The more Google knows about users, the more helpful it can be"" to advertisers.
Part of Firebase's appeal is that it is bundled with Google's Android Studio, the most well-known program to code apps for Google's Android operating system. But Google over the last two years has made it difficult for apps to operate common functions without Firebase tools, the sources said.
Kyle Carline, who oversees 50 apps for the Christian media company Salem Web Network, said the increasing dependence on Google services makes him ""wary because Google is the powerhouse it is."" 
For instance, apps last year started needing Firebase Cloud Messaging to send push notifications. Google has said the set-up prevents apps from draining phone batteries. It told Reuters that apps have another option in Pushy, but that tool's founder Elad Nava acknowledged that stringent Google restrictions increasingly challenge Pushy's viability.
""There's definitely a trend where Google is trying to get as many services into Firebase as possible and restrict developers from using other services,"" Nava said.
Another Firebase tool is needed for apps to record data about their visitors in Google's analytics service. Previously, the service accepted data from alternative tools without the need for Google code, said Craig Rouse, mobile strategy lead at mobile software company Tealium.
Most recently, Google has told apps that Firebase will significantly improve results of their Google ad campaigns, ad buyers and app makers said. It is a persuasive pitch because ""Google will have a much more rich dataset"" to inform when to shows ads, said Kim Cooling, director of planning at ad agency M&C Saatchi Performance.
RIVALS REACT 
Some Firebase competitors said they want Android Studio to promote them, too. Google said developers are not required to use Android Studio.
Mark Piller, chief executive of rival mobile software vendor Backendless, said Android developers ""deserve to know that there is a choice.""
Companies such as Backendless, though, have survived because apps historically ditched Firebase tools once they could afford specialty services.
For instance, Firebase alternatives see their market share tick up slightly among health and finance apps, which require unique features due to government regulations, according to data from market tracker Appfigures.
Competitors point to Google pushing Firebase as an illustration of how big tech companies use small-dollar acquisitions to quietly extend their dominance, a practice the U.S. Federal Trade Commission began studying last month.

Google, which acquired Firebase in 2014, when it was three years old, has expanded its toolkit through other small deals, including acquiring the services Fabric and Crashlytics from  Twitter Inc  (N:TWTR) in 2017.

1039,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 19, 2020 08:06AM ET</span>","Factbox: From Boeing to Tennessee whiskey, coronavirus U.S. bailout requests top $2 trillion","(Reuters) - As the coronavirus pandemic threatens to bring U.S. economic activity to a halt, American businesses are jockeying for a financial lifeline from President Donald Trump's administration and Congress.
Here is a look at requests to federal or state lawmakers for aid to offset the economic fallout of the pandemic.
NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF MANUFACTURERS
The National Association of Manufacturers called for the federal government to create a resiliency fund that would include $1.4 trillion in loans to help manufacturers and small businesses. The fund would help protect the financial security of the almost 13 million workers in the industry, the group said in a statement on Wednesday.
RESTAURANTS
A U.S. restaurant trade group on Wednesday asked the White House and congressional leaders for a $455 billion aid package, saying that the industry could shed nearly half of its 15.6 million jobs and at least a quarter of its annual sales because of the coronavirus outbreak.
The Washington-based association said restaurants could take a $225 billion sales hit in the next three months, a quarter of their projected total sales of $899 billion.
HOTEL, TRAVEL INDUSTRY
American hotel and travel industry executives met with Trump on Tuesday to discuss a potential $250 billion aid package, as thousands of hotel workers began furloughs due to the coronavirus outbreak.
The requested package would consist of $150 billion in direct aid for the hotel sector and $100 billion for related travel companies including convention businesses, industry executives said on a call after the meeting with Trump, who made his fortune in real estate and hotels.
U.S. CONFERENCE OF MAYORS
The U.S. Conference of Mayors has asked Congress for $250 billion in localized aid to help cities stop the spread of the coronavirus, including through resources for public health departments, supporting small businesses and addressing food insecurity.
HEALTH CARE INDUSTRY
The American Hospital Association, American Medical Association and American Nurses Association asked Congress on Thursday to allocate $100 billion to help health-care personnel and providers, including physicians, nurses and hospitals, respond to the new coronavirus, according to a letter on the hospital association's website.
BOEING
 Boeing Co  (N:BA) on Tuesday called for a $60 billion bailout in access to public and private liquidity, including loan guarantees, for the struggling U.S. aerospace manufacturing industry, which faces huge losses from the pandemic.
The U.S. planemaker has told lawmakers it needs significant government support to meet liquidity needs and it cannot raise that in current market conditions, people briefed on the matter said.
AIRLINE INDUSTRY
Major U.S. airlines sought a government bailout of more than $50 billion in the wake of the steep falloff in travel demand sparked by the outbreak.
Airlines for America, the trade group representing American Airlines (O:AAL), United Airlines Inc (O:UAL), Delta Air Lines Inc (N:DAL), Southwest Airlines Co (N:LUV) and others, said the industry needs $25 billion in grants, $25 billion in loans and significant tax relief to survive. They seek tax relief that could be worth tens of billions of dollars through the end of at least 2021.
They also want a package of $8 billion, equally divided in grants and loans for cargo carriers.
AIRPORTS
U.S. airports are seeking $10 billion in federal assistance to help offset losses incurred by the sharp drop in travel, two people briefed on the matter said.
NATIVE AMERICAN GAMING INDUSTRY
The Native American gaming industry on Tuesday requested $18 billion in U.S. federal aid as it shut casinos that are the sole source of commercial revenue for dozens of tribes in a bid to slow the spread of the coronavirus.
Tribal governments will be unable to provide health and education services and will default on loans unless they get federal support to make up for lost casino money, the National Indian Gaming Association said in a letter to members of the U.S. House of Representatives.
The roughly 460 Indian casinos are in the process of closing given the threat of the coronavirus to tribal members and many non-Native American employees.
PORTS
The American Association of Port Authorities is seeking $6.5 billion in grants and direct assistance in the wake of a steep decline in port and cruise line traffic following the coronavirus pandemic, according to a letter to congressional leaders seen by Reuters.
The group representing major U.S. ports said early estimates suggest a 20% annualized reduction in cargo activity at U.S. ports, leading to a loss of $1 billion in revenue.
The group seeks $1 billion in port grants, $1 billion in direct assistance and $4.5 billion for federal navigation channel improvement and maintenance projects.
AMTRAK
Amtrak said on Monday that the U.S. passenger rail service and its state partners need $1 billion in government assistance after a dramatic decline in travel because of the coronavirus. Amtrak said bookings had plunged 50% during the crisis.
TENNESSEE DISTILLERS GUILD
The Tennessee Distillers Guild said on Tuesday it asked the state's governor and legislature for relief to offset the blow from suspending tours, canceling large events and ceasing production due to the coronavirus.

The guild asked for immediate temporary relief for distilling, brewing and hospitality industries from payroll, gallonage and liquor by the drink taxes, though it did not specify how much aid it sought.

1040,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 19, 2020 08:06AM ET</span>",Wall Street ends higher to stem coronavirus sell-off,"By Caroline Valetkevitch
NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks managed to post gains on Thursday after recent steep losses as policymakers around the world took further emergency actions to try to help financial markets cope with deep coronavirus-driven economic damage.
Nasdaq outperformed other major indexes, ending 2.3% higher, fueled by gains in Amazon.com (O:AMZN), Microsoft (O:MSFT) and Facebook (O:FB).
The Federal Reserve opened swap lines with central banks in nine new countries to ensure the world's dollar-dependent financial system continued to function.
It was the latest in a host of steps taken by the U.S. central bank over the last two weeks, including cutting borrowing costs to near zero and providing billions of dollars more for cheap credit.
The European Central Bank pledged late on Wednesday to buy 750 billion euros ($820 billion) in sovereign debt through 2020. 
President Donald Trump called on U.S. health regulators to expedite potential therapies aimed at treating COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the virus, and the White House sounded upbeat on the chances of passage of hundreds of billions of dollars of aid in Congress. 
Policymakers will need to keep providing support in order to provide liquidity to the financial system, said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial (NYSE:PRU) in Newark, New Jersey.
""It is not just about the Fed,"" Krosby said. ""It is about the fiscal side of the equation. The question for the market is, how much do we actually need, and the severity of the crisis is suggesting we're going to need amounts we never initially thought of.""
Even with the emergency moves, analysts in a Reuters poll gave a median 80% chance of a U.S. recession this year. Bank of America (NYSE:BAC)'s economics team in a note Thursday said, ""the U.S. recession is here.""
The recent sharp market volatility continued, with the S&P 500 index falling as much as 3.3% during the session.
And Thursday's gains did little to restore the markets after the pounding stocks have suffered in the past month. The S&P 500 remains down about 29% from the record closing high it hit a month ago after last week confirming its first bear market since the financial crisis, and the Dow erased virtually the last of its gains under Trump's presidency on Wednesday. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) rose 188.27 points, or 0.95%, to 20,087.19, the S&P 500 (SPX) gained 11.29 points, or 0.47%, to 2,409.39 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) added 160.73 points, or 2.3%, to 7,150.58.
Helping the day's sentiment, U.S. crude oil prices spiked by 25% in their largest single-day gain on record, while the S&P 500 energy index (SPNY) rose 6.8%, leading gains among S&P 500 sectors.
""Active investors are using this as an opportunity to maybe pick up what might be perceived as bargains because nobody's really sure how to value stocks right now,"" said Robert Pavlik, chief investment strategist and senior portfolio manager at SlateStone Wealth LLC in New York.
 Ford Motor Co  (N:F) was the latest major U.S. corporation to bolster its cash reserves to ride out the virus impact, drawing down more than $15 billion from existing credit lines. Ford shares ended down 0.7%. 
The virus' impact on jobs was also in focus as official data showed the number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits surged to a 2-1/2-year high last week as companies in the services sector laid off workers because of the pandemic.
Late on Wednesday, New York Stock Exchange owner Intercontinental Exchange Inc (N:ICE) said the market would temporarily close its trading floors and move fully to electronic trading starting next week.
While the S&P 500 added $94 billion in market capitalization on Thursday, it is down $8.09 trillion since its Feb. 19 record close, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices' analyst Howard Silverblatt.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 2.64-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 3.21-to-1 ratio favored advancers.
The S&P 500 posted three new 52-week highs and 94 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 13 new highs and 569 new lows.

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 17.08 billion shares, compared to the 15 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

DUBAI (Reuters) - Dubai has received commitments from a group of 10 banks for $9 billion in loans to take full control of port operator DP World (DI:DPW) and refinance debt of state investment vehicle Dubai World, two sources told Reuters. 
The debt transaction is one of the few deals keeping investment bankers busy in the Gulf as the global coronavirus outbreak slams the brakes on capital markets activity. 
Dubai last month said that state company Port and Free Zone World (PFZW), part of Dubai World, planned to buy publicly listed shares of DP World in a deal with a $13.9 billion valuation.
Citi (N:C) and  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) underwrote $9 billion in loans for the transaction and immediately started talks with other banks to distribute the debt, sources told Reuters at the time.
This week a group of 10 banks, including Citi and Deutsche, signed commitments that covered and oversubscribed the $9 billion debt deal, said two sources close to the deal.
The other eight banks are Bank of Nova Scotia (TO:BNS),  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR), Emirates NBD (DU:ENBD), First Abu Dhabi Bank (AD:FAB), HSBC (L:HSBA), JPMorgan (N:JPM), Samba Financial Group (SE:1090) and  Standard Chartered  (L:STAN), one of the sources said.
The transaction involves a $3 billion five-year loan, with the rest of the financing comprising shorter-term debt, the source said.
DP World, Citi, Deutsche Bank, Emirates NBD, JPMorgan, and Standard Chartered declined to comment while the other banks and the Dubai department of finance did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The planned delisting of DP World will add to its leveraging, which last month pushed ratings agencies Moody's and Fitch to place the company under review for a potential downgrade.
As part of the deal, DP World will borrow $5.15 billion to fund a dividend to Dubai World, which is the sole shareholder of PFZW, helping it meet outstanding obligations to lenders.
Dubai World, a conglomerate with interests in ports, real estate and hospitality, signed a $25 billion debt restructuring agreement in 2011 after Dubai was hit by the global financial crisis.
The jumbo $9 billion loan deal was marketed to banks amid increasing concerns over the economic impact of coronavirus on Dubai, a Middle East trade, transportation and tourism hub.
Two banks that were asked to commit to the transaction did not participate, one of the sources said without naming the banks.

The loans will be sold over the coming weeks to a wider group of banks, both sources said.

1043,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 19, 2020 07:19AM ET</span>",Google critics see its Firebase tools as another squeeze play,"By Paresh Dave
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Some app developers say Alphabet Inc's (O:GOOGL) Google is increasingly pressing them to embed code in their own products that will deepen Google's access to data on consumers, giving the company a leg up on rivals. 
The previously unreported concerns about Firebase, a set of software that Google makes available to apps, have become part of the broad investigations launched last summer by state attorneys general and the United States Department of Justice into whether Google has unlawfully stifled competition in online advertising and other businesses, two people with knowledge of the probes said this month.
The Texas attorney general’s office, which is leading the states’ investigation, and the Justice Department did not respond to requests to comment. 
Google declined to comment beyond generally describing Firebase tools as optional, usable in tandem with competing services and potential revenue-boosters for apps. They spare app makers from coding basic components or having to install alternatives that can be more complex.
Embedded inside apps such as Instacart and  Expedia  (NASDAQ:EXPE), Firebase software plays a big role storing data, delivering notifications, logging glitches and tracking clicks.
Firebase tools give Google, the internet's top ad seller, information on what consumers are doing inside apps that it can exploit to target ads to users, according to makers of Firebase alternatives. 
""It's about data collection and ad serving,"" said Bob Lawson, founder and director of mobile software company Kumulos. ""The more Google knows about users, the more helpful it can be"" to advertisers.
Part of Firebase's appeal is that it is bundled with Google's Android Studio, the most well-known program to code apps for Google's Android operating system. But Google over the last two years has made it difficult for apps to operate common functions without Firebase tools, the sources said.
Kyle Carline, who oversees 50 apps for the Christian media company Salem Web Network, said the increasing dependence on Google services makes him ""wary because Google is the powerhouse it is."" 
For instance, apps last year started needing Firebase Cloud Messaging to send push notifications. Google has said the set-up prevents apps from draining phone batteries. It told Reuters that apps have another option in Pushy, but that tool's founder Elad Nava acknowledged that stringent Google restrictions increasingly challenge Pushy's viability.
""There's definitely a trend where Google is trying to get as many services into Firebase as possible and restrict developers from using other services,"" Nava said.
Another Firebase tool is needed for apps to record data about their visitors in Google's analytics service. Previously, the service accepted data from alternative tools without the need for Google code, said Craig Rouse, mobile strategy lead at mobile software company Tealium.
Most recently, Google has told apps that Firebase will significantly improve results of their Google ad campaigns, ad buyers and app makers said. It is a persuasive pitch because ""Google will have a much more rich dataset"" to inform when to shows ads, said Kim Cooling, director of planning at ad agency M&C Saatchi Performance.
RIVALS REACT 
Some Firebase competitors said they want Android Studio to promote them, too. Google said developers are not required to use Android Studio.
Mark Piller, chief executive of rival mobile software vendor Backendless, said Android developers ""deserve to know that there is a choice.""
Companies such as Backendless, though, have survived because apps historically ditched Firebase tools once they could afford specialty services.
For instance, Firebase alternatives see their market share tick up slightly among health and finance apps, which require unique features due to government regulations, according to data from market tracker Appfigures.
Competitors point to Google pushing Firebase as an illustration of how big tech companies use small-dollar acquisitions to quietly extend their dominance, a practice the U.S. Federal Trade Commission began studying last month.

Google, which acquired Firebase in 2014, when it was three years old, has expanded its toolkit through other small deals, including acquiring the services Fabric and Crashlytics from  Twitter Inc  (N:TWTR) in 2017.

1044,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 19, 2020 07:08AM ET</span>",Airline industry may not survive without state aid: Lufthansa,"By Douglas Busvine
BERLIN (Reuters) - The airline industry may not survive without state aid if the coronavirus pandemic lasts a long time, Lufthansa (DE:LHAG) warned on Thursday, predicting it would emerge into a ""different world"" after the crisis.
Like many of its rivals, Lufthansa has slashed flights, cut working hours and suspended its dividend to try to cope with the fallout from a crisis that has seen governments impose draconian travel restrictions and bookings evaporate. 
""Our business, and I speak with 30 years experience, is in an extraordinary situation,"" CEO Carsten Spohr told reporters.
""For weeks, hardly anyone has wanted to fly. Now, hardly anyone can.""
The German group stopped short of requesting state loans, however, saying it was cutting costs where it can so it can ride out a crisis that has forced it to ground 700 planes and slash passenger capacity by 95%.
""We would seek active support from the state when this is necessary. This is not yet necessary,"" Spohr said, adding Lufthansa was in discussions with German state development bank KfW.
Global airlines group IATA has forecast the industry will need up to $200 billion of state support.
""This crisis will sustainably and structurally change our industry,"" Spohr said. ""But we believe that we are well prepared and have experience in crisis management."" 
Lufthansa, whose stock market value has fallen by nearly half this year to 4 billion euros ($4.3 billion) was protected by German law against hostile foreign takeovers, Spohr said in response to a reporter's question. Its shares rose by 5%.
Around 60% of Lufthansa's costs are variable - such as fuel - and they fall away naturally as operations are wound down. More savings are being sought via short-time work, with the help of German government aid payments designed to minimize layoffs.
Lufthansa employs 138,000 staff, more than half of them in Germany. 
Spohr also said the company was in talks with planemakers with Airbus (PA:AIR) and Boeing (N:BA) about whether to take delivery of aircraft it has ordered, and on payments.
""We had planned this year to receive a new plane every 10 days - now we don't need any,"" he told reporters.
The desperate outlook came as Australia's Qantas Airways Ltd (AX:QAN) told most of its 30,000 employees to take leave and India prepared a $1.6 billion rescue package to aid carriers.
RELIEF FLIGHTS, CARGO OPERATIONS CONTINUE
Lufthansa, which also owns Swiss International, Austrian Airlines and Brussels Airlines, is carrying out 140 relief flights to repatriate stranded citizens in what has been described as the biggest operation of its kind.
""In addition, we are doing our utmost to help ensure that supply chains for many thousands of businesses do not break down by mobilizing additional capacity for air freight transport,"" said Spohr.
As governments across the world close borders and airports, the Lufthansa Group has been forced to make drastic cuts in its flight operations.
Austrian Airlines is suspending operations until March 28, with the exception of special flights, after its last scheduled flight to Vienna landed on Thursday.
Swiss International Air Lines said it was experiencing massive revenue losses and short-term measures to safeguard liquidity were the top priority.
Lufthansa is also discontinuing long-haul flights from Munich and for now will only offer three intercontinental flights per day from Frankfurt.
Around 700 of Lufthansa Group's 763 aircraft will be temporarily parked. Some passenger planes may be redeployed to shift freight.
In order to secure its finances, the Lufthansa Group said it had raised an additional 600 million euros ($650 million) in recent weeks, giving it liquidity of around 4.3 billion euros. 
In addition, it has unused credit lines of around 800 million euros and is looking to raise further funds, including through aircraft financing.
""We own 86% of the Group's fleet, which is largely unencumbered and has a book value of around 10 billion euros,"" said Chief Financial Officer Ulrik Svensson.
The executive board will take a 20% pay cut, Lufthansa said, confirming 2019 results released on March 13.

1045,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 19, 2020 07:00AM ET</span>",Stocks - U.S. Futures Head Lower; Jobless Claims Data Eyed,"By Peter Nurse    
Investing.com - U.S. stocks are set to open lower Thursday, with investors still wary about the impact on corporate America of the measures introduced to combat the coronavirus pandemic, although losses are seen being less severe than of late.
At 6:55 AM ET (1055 GMT), futures for the S&P 500 traded 40 points, or 1.7%, lower, futures for the Nasdaq down 59 points, or 0.8%, while the Dow Jones 30 futures contract fell 352 points, or 1.8%. These contracts have been stopped limit down in previous sessions, which happens when the losses are greater than 5%.
Late Wednesday, the Federal Reserve rolled out its third emergency credit program in two days, aimed at keeping the $3.8 trillion money market mutual fund industry functioning.
This follows the U.S. central bank slashing interest rates to near zero and pledging hundreds of billions of dollars in asset purchases last weekend, while President Donald Trump's administration has drawn up a $1 trillion stimulus and rescue proposal, in addition to the $500 billion passed by the Senate late on Wednesday.
However, investors have yet to be convinced these policies will be sufficient to insulate corporate America from the damage caused by the shuttering of restaurants and bars, the paralyzing of transportation systems and the depletion of shops.
The trade group for the U.S. airline industry has already asked the Federal government for nearly $60 billion in direct assistance and loan guarantees, dwarfing the $15 billion made available after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. While the big three automakers in Detroit - Ford (NYSE:F), General Motors (NYSE:GM) and Fiat Chrysler (NYSE:FCAU)- have confirmed they would be temporarily shutting U.S. plants, as well as factories in Canada and Mexico. Hotel operator Marriott has furloughed tens of thousands of workers, while  Lyft  (NASDAQ:LYFT) and Uber (NYSE:UBER) have restricted their ride-sharing services. 
With this in mind, eyes will focus on the release of the initial jobless claims, 08:30 AM ET (1230 GMT), which cover the week ended March 14. 
“We should expect to see a big jump already here and we should expect the number to jump even further in the weeks to come,” said Danske Bank, in a research note. “This is one of the fastest indicators we will get for the impact of the U.S. measures implemented to slow down the coronavirus spreading. This will eventually be decisive for how much the politicians will do in the U.S. to offset the crisis.”
Oil prices have seen some relief buying Thursday after a heavy sell-off in the previous session, but they remain under the $30 mark. 
Global benchmark Brent tumbled 13% on Wednesday, while U.S. crude oil lost nearly 25%.  
AT 06:55 AM ET (1055 GMT), U.S. crude futures traded 11% higher at $23.22 a barrel.  Brent  rose 6.2% to $26.43.
Additionally, gold futures dropped 0.1% to $1,476.30/oz, while EUR/USD traded at $1.0799, down 1% as the dollar continued its surge against almost all currencies from China to Switzerland and Russia. The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against basket of developed market currencies, rose to its highest in over three years overnight to trade after the European Central Bank and its peers in Australia and Switzerland all announced further stimulus packages.

1050,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 19, 2020 06:13AM ET</span>",How a Texas oil CEO's luxury land deals cost him his job,"By Liz Hampton
MIDLAND (Reuters) - In July 2018, oilfield service executive Dale Redman took out a loan to buy the Whitehead Ranch - a 20,000-acre cattle and hunting property in central Texas, featuring two luxury homes, livestock barns, and meadows stocked with deer and turkey.
The indulgence fit the lifestyle of a Texas oil tycoon, but the way Redman secured the deal was among a series of missteps that cost him his job. The CEO pledged 230,000 shares of his ProPetro Holding Corp. stock as collateral on the $24.8 million ranch loan - without telling investors - a move the company said violated his agreement to safeguard shareholders as it disclosed Redman's resignation on Monday.
Redman’s ouster came less than three weeks after Reuters sent a letter to Redman and ProPetro directors seeking comment on the ranch loan and other aspects of the CEO’s financial affairs.
A Reuters examination shows how the self-made oil magnate created myriad conflicts of interest by entangling his personal business interests with those of the company that paid him $15.6 million from 2016 to 2018.
The Reuters findings - based on company documents and interviews with about two dozen former ProPetro employees, law enforcement officials, and vendors - included at least four deals in which ProPetro had awarded business to private ventures owned by Redman. ProPetro also employed three close relatives of Redman and two other executives in highly paid senior positions. Redman also secured a second loan for another ranch by using company stock as collateral, an arrangement that can send a company’s stock value down if an executive is forced to liquidate shares to pay back a loan.
Corporate governance experts said that such practices, while not illegal, are rare at public companies because they create conflicts of interest between executives and the shareholders they serve.
Redman and a ProPetro spokesperson declined to comment on the issues raised in the Feb. 26 letter from Reuters or on Redman’s resignation.
Reuters reported in October that the SEC was investigating alleged financial irregularities at ProPetro. Since then, the firm’s shares (N:PUMP) have dropped about $9 to $1.5, and the company has delayed filing financial reports with the SEC as it confirms the accuracy of its accounting. The company said this week that it had previously made inaccurate filings because of Redman's failure to disclose that he used shares for loan collateral.
Redman in January sold his Whitehead Ranch and last year put his private jet on the market, according to aviation and real estate sales websites. He also faces investor lawsuits over allegations that he and other ProPetro executives improperly enriched themselves and distributed false information to shareholders.
SAND, LAND, AND A JET
ProPetro was founded in 2005 and has since grown into one of the largest fracking firms in the Permian Basin, the most prolific U.S. oilfield. The company generated $1.7 billion in sales in 2018, growing rapidly by fracking wells for top U.S. shale producers such as  Exxon Mobil  (N:XOM) and  Diamondback Energy Inc  (O:FANG).
Fracking work involves pumping water, chemicals and sand into underground rock formations at high pressure to break up rocks and free deposits of oil and gas inside.
In 2018, ProPetro bought about $10 million worth of sand from a company that mined it on land leased from a firm in which Redman owned a 44% stake, according to a ProPetro SEC filing at the time. The deal netted Redman about $300,000 in royalties, according to the filing.
ProPetro said in the filing that its audit committee had authorized the sand supply deal without Redman's involvement.
A Reuters examination of other public records revealed that the sand-mining company was named  Covia  Holdings Corp. (N:CVIA), and the oil exploration and production company that leased Covia the land was Redman's Red Hogg LLC.
One of the members of the ProPetro audit committee that approved the deal was director Alan E. Douglas, who had served as an accountant for Red Hogg, according to a Texas business filings.
Douglas did not respond to a letter requesting comment. Covia declined to comment.
Covia employees who were aware of Redman's involvement in Red Hogg privately expressed reservations about the conflict of interest inherent in the sand supply deal, a former Covia employee said, because it generated income for Redman.
South Midkiff Partners LLC, a company owned by Redman and then-Chief Financial Officer Jeffrey Smith, charged ProPetro at least $420,000 in rent a year under a deal for work properties and equipment yards, company documents show.
Smith and representatives of South Midkiff did not respond to requests for comment.
Another Redman-owned company, PD Properties, also made $192,000 in 2017 by renting oilfield equipment to ProPetro, and received $72,000 annually in rent for the firm's corporate offices under a five-year deal, according to a 2019 proxy filing.
Redman also rented out his private jet to ProPetro for business trips, receiving nearly $400,000 in 2018 and at least $451,278 in the prior two years combined, ProPetro SEC filings show.
The company did not disclose the purpose of the trips and did not specify who traveled on Redman's Learjet. Before ProPetro went public, Redman used his plane at least once to reward an oilfield crew by flying them to New Orleans to watch a Saints football game, said a former employee who went on the trip.
While the jet rental payments were disclosed to investors, corporate governance experts called the practice problematic because it raised questions about whether the company had paid market rates.
FAMILY AFFAIR
Relatives of Redman and his business partners were employed in high-paying jobs at ProPetro, according to a Reuters review of ProPetro filings.
Redman's son-in-law, for example, worked in sales for ProPetro, and brought home $530,500 in 2018. Former CFO Smith's daughter was the controller, and pulled in $338,800. And the son of the chief operating officer, David Sledge, was its head of investor relations, with compensation of $717,000, according to ProPetro filings.
The executives and their relatives did not respond to requests for comment made through ProPetro.
In the middle of last year, ProPetro said in an SEC filing it had begun an internal audit of financial controls. Since then many top executives and directors have left or been demoted. On Monday, ProPetro said Redman had resigned and was being replaced as CEO by Phillip Gobe, who had served as an executive and director at several other energy companies, including shale producer  Pioneer Natural Resources  (N:PXD).
'QUEEN OF TEXAS HILL COUNTRY'
Redman started buying ranch land around the time the company went public. State records and bank filings show Redman, beginning in mid-2017, put up as many as 601,200 ProPetro shares – worth more than $8 million at the time - as collateral for two separate loans. The shares accounted for 35% of Redman's holdings in ProPetro.
In the first such deal, with Vista Bank in May 2017, Redman put up 371,200 shares, according to Uniform Commercial Code filings with the Texas Secretary of State.
The documents did not make clear the loan amount or purpose. But in January 2017, Redman purchased the Preston Ranch in Menard County, Texas, according to local real estate records. The local tax assessor appraised the property at $10.4 million.
A year and a half later, Redman purchased the Whitehead Ranch, after borrowing $24.8 million from West Texas National Bank. That deal was revised to remove the ProPetro shares as collateral two months later, according to the filings.
Redman still owns Preston Ranch, according to county real estate records. But he sold the Whitehead property in January, after advertising it at $30 million.
""The turkey hunting has been called 'second to none',"" according to the real estate listing, which described the property as ""The Queen of the Texas Hill Country."""

Investing.com -- Turning point, relief rally or dead-cat bounce?
That’s the thought occupying most European investors on Thursday after the European Central Bank unleashed its bazooka in the dead of night, announcing a monetary easing program that goes beyond anything it unveiled in the euro debt crisis.
The 750 billion-euro package was accompanied by some overdue clarity from the ECB on its commitment to keeping bond spreads down, banishing fears that the currency union could sleepwalk into a new crisis.
Such bold moves signalled the beginning of the end for the last financial crisis, but markets are still reluctant to start pricing that in until the Covid-19 outbreak shows signs of peaking. With the number of new cases in Italy accelerating on Wednesday and still rising fast elsewhere across the continent, that moment is still some way off.
By 6 AM ET (1000 GMT), the benchmark Euro Stoxx 600 had rebounded 0.7% to 281.36, giving up over half of its gains at opening. The Italian FTSE MIB made the most convincing recovery, risen 3.5%, while the German DAX was up 0.1%. Growing concern over a muddled-seeming U.K. response left the U.K. FTSE as the continent’s biggest laggard, losing 0.4%. The FTSE 250 midcap index fell even more sharply.
Spanish and Italian banks posted handsome gains as their national bond spreads compressed. Unicredit (MI:CRDI) stock rose 5.1% while  Bankia  (MC:BKIA) stock rose 10.8%. The promise of ECB support for corporate debt also helped a sharp rebound in Ryanair (LON:RYA) stock, which rose 7.4%, and hotel operator  Accor  (PA:ACCP), up 5.1%. National telecoms champions, from the Netherlands’  KPN (AS:KPN) to Spain’s  Telefonica  (MC:TEF) and France’s Orange (PA:ORAN), were also up sharply, while BT Group (LON:BT) and  Vodafone  (LON:VOD) underperformed.
Fiscal support measures also continue to flood in: the U.S. Senate on Wednesday waved through without changes a $500 billion support package that majority Republicans only a week ago were dismissing as a ‘liberal wish list’. Meanwhile, the German government on Thursday announced another 40 billion-euro package of measures to support small businesses.
The German move followed the early release of the closely-watched Ifo business sentiment index for March, which predictably recorded its sharpest ever monthly drop. Both the current assessment and the expectations component dropped significantly, with expectations at the lowest level since January 2009, ING economist Carsten Brzeski noted.
Brzeski warned though that such indicators “are nothing more than a snapshot” that say nothing substantial about the future.
“The depth of the recession will be determined by how long the virus outbreak and the lockdowns will last,” Brzeski said in a note to clients. “Government measures taken over the last few days as well as the ECB’s measures last night and last week should somehow cushion the plunge but are even more important in paving the way for any recovery if and when the worst is behind us.”"
1052,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 19, 2020 06:06AM ET</span>",Global accounting body wants to force companies to spell out takeover motives,"By Huw Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - A global accounting standard setter said it wants to force companies to spell out their thinking behind acquisitions to break new ground in making boards more answerable to shareholders.
The International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) set out on Thursday possible rule changes after investors said they wanted more information on whether takeovers live up to expectations, which is not always the case.
""This is very much blue sky thinking,"" said Sue Lloyd, vice chair of the IASB, which sets accounting rules that are mandatory in over 140 countries, including the European Union and Britain, but not the United States, which has its own standards.
It would be a first in terms of accounting standards, she said.
Under existing IASB rules, acquisitions are accounted for under an annual test to see if goodwill needs writing down, a reference to the value of intangible assets acquired when buying another company.
Investors have mixed views on whether this is a useful test of how an acquisition is performing, Lloyd said.
The IASB concluded against amending the goodwill standard, such as by reintroducing amortization or gradually writing down goodwill over time, she said.
Instead, it will supplement the existing goodwill standard with a new rule requiring disclosures on the performance of an acquisition in annual reports.
""The focus of this discussion paper is very much on a set of disclosures to help investors really understand acquisitions and whether they have gone well or not,"" Lloyd said.
Companies would monitor a takeover and its performance for two years or explain to investors why they were not doing so.
To reduce the reporting burden, companies could ""piggy back"" on information management used for making an acquisition in the first place, she said.
Depending on feedback from a public consultation that lasts until September, more specific proposals would come later.
The aim is to shine a light on whether companies are increasing value to shareholders by making acquisitions at the price paid, and whether the touted benefits of the deal live up to expectations, Lloyd said.
""At the moment we don't have a set of disclosures that provide that set of information,"" she said."
1053,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 19, 2020 06:01AM ET</span>",Dollar rules; ECB stimulus boosts bonds,"By Tom Wilson and Tom Westbrook
LONDON/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The dollar surged on Thursday as extraordinary steps by central banks across the world to cope with a coronavirus-induced financial rout had mixed success.
The dollar gained against the British pound to its highest since 1985, last up 0.8% at $1.1535, as investors rushed to secure liquidity.
Against a basket of six major currencies (=USD) the dollar gained 0.6%, near a more-than-three-year high touched a day earlier.
Bond markets recovered after the European Central Bank pledged late on Wednesday to buy 750 billion euros ($820 billion) in sovereign debt through 2020. That brought the ECB's planned purchases for this year to 1.1 trillion euro, with the new purchases alone worth 6% of the euro zone's GDP.
Sovereign bond yields in Italy and across the euro zone dropped after the ECB's emergency measures, and European stocks arrested their rout.
""The announcement (the ECB) has made has gone some way to comforting markets that borrowing costs in those economies won't be allowed to spiral higher,"" said Mike Bell, global market strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management.
Europe's broad Euro STOXX 600 (STOXX) eked out a 1.2% gain in early trading, with most indexes in Frankfurt (GDAXI) up a 1.5% and Paris (FCHI) climbing 3.3%. London's FTSE (FTSE) added 0.6%.
Equities remained shaky elsewhere as the dollar rose. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan slumped by 4% slump (MIAPJ0000PUS). Korea and Taiwan led the losses as the index plunged to a four-year low, with circuit breakers triggered in Seoul, Jakarta and Manila.
MSCI's world equity index (MIWD00000PUS), which tracks shares in 49 countries, was down 0.2%.
Wall Street futures were pointing to gains of 0.1%. .

ITALIAN YIELDS FALL
Italy, which has seen its borrowing costs jump in recent days, led the drop in yields after the ECB move. Its two-year bond yields slumped by than 100 basis points to 0.41% (IT2YT=RR), heading for its biggest one-day fall since 1996. Italy's 10-year bond yields slid as much as 90 bps to 1.40% (IT10YT=RR).
The gap over safer German Bund yields tightened almost 100 bps from Wednesday's closing levels and were set for the biggest daily drop since the 2011 euro one crisis.
Markets elsewhere failed to respond to central bank action. Before the ECB move, the U.S. Federal Reserve promised a liquidity facility for money market mutual funds and the Bank of Japan made two unscheduled bond purchases totalling 1.3 trillion yen ($12 billion). The Australian central bank slashed interest rates to a record low of 0.25%.
Traders reported huge strains in bond markets, however, as distressed funds sold any liquid asset to cover losses in stocks and redemptions from investors.
Benchmark 10-year sovereign bond yields in New Zealand, Malaysia, Korea and Singapore and Thailand surged as prices tumbled, and U.S. 10 year Treasuries (US10YT=RR) rose 10 basis points through the session.
""Not only central banks, but governments are throwing everything at the economy right now, but markets aren't responding"" said Luca Paolini, chief strategist Pictet Asset Management.
Commodities fell as the virus outbreak worsened. The pandemic has killed almost 9,000 people globally, infected more than 218,000 and prompted widespread emergency lockdowns.
Gold fell 1% before regaining some of those losses. Copper hit its down-limit in Shanghai.
Oil steadied after an overnight plunge to an 18-year low in Asian trade. Brent (LCOc1) was up $2.14 to $27.02.
J.P. Morgan economists forecast the U.S. economy will shrink 14% in the next quarter and the Chinese economy will drop more than 40% on an annualised basis in the current one.
""There is no longer doubt that the longest global expansion on record will end this quarter,"" they said in a note. ""The key outlook issue now is gauging the depth and the duration of the 2020 recession."""
1054,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 19, 2020 05:54AM ET</span>","Le Maire to present Macron with plans for top firms, nationalizations possible","PARIS (Reuters) - French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said on Thursday that he would soon present to President Emmanuel Macron various plans and options to help the country's biggest companies cope with the coronavirus crisis, including possible nationalizations.

""We have all these options on the table, we are looking at them all, and I will be presenting them all to the President quite imminently,"" he said.
Some French companies in which the state holds a stake have suffered steep drops in their share prices due to the outbreak, although news of a new ECB bond buying plan boosted them on Thursday along with the broader stock market.
With production halted due to the outbreak, carmakers are among those to see the sharpest declines in their shares.  Renault  (PA:RENA), in which the state has a 15% stake, has suffered a 62% drop in its share price since the start of the year while rival PSA  Peugeot  Citroen (PA:PEUP), 12% owned by the Bpifrance public investment bank, is down 52%.
Meanwhile, the halt in air travel has sent Air France KLM (PA:AIRF), in which the French state holds a 14% stake, shares down 54% this year.

Investing.com - European stock markets pushed higher Thursday, as the European Central Bank joined policymakers around the world in attempting to shore up the financial markets, unveiling its biggest anti-crisis program yet.
At 03:50 ET (0850 GMT), the U.K.'s FTSE index was trading 0.5% higher, France's CAC 40 was up 3.4%, while the DAX was up 1.7%. The pan-eurozone index, the Euro Stoxx 50, gained 2.8%. 
The European Central Bank launched a 750 billion euro ($820 billion) emergency bond purchase scheme after an unscheduled meeting Wednesday. It will buy government and company debt across the eurozone, including that of troubled Greece and Italy. Sovereign bond spreads, which had widened sharply in recent days, came in sharply in response.
This announcement came after the bank's 25-member governing council held emergency talks by phone late into Wednesday evening.
The move follows an unprecedented and large step up in global co-ordination by central banks, governments and regulators since the start of this week to cushion the economic impact of the coronavirus.
""Extraordinary times require extraordinary action,"" ECB President Christine Lagarde said, amid concerns that the strains from the burgeoning crisis, seen with the widening of yield spreads over the German benchmark, could eventually tear apart the euro zone as a single currency bloc.
Oil & gas stocks have seen some gains Thursday after prolonged losses, while banks have benefited from the ECB’s bond purchase scheme. But worries still exist in the airlines sector after Deutsche Lufthansa (DE:LHAG) added its voice to the chorus saying the industry may not survive without state aid if the coronavirus pandemic lasts for a long time.
""The spread of the coronavirus has placed the entire global economy and our company as well in an unprecedented state of emergency,"" CEO Carsten Spohr said in a statement. ""At present, no one can foresee the consequences."" Lufthansa has grounded the vast bulk of its fleet as demand grinds to a halt.
Economic indicators are thin on the ground in Europe Thursday, while oil markets have seen some gains after three days of relentless selling.

European government bonds from Italy to Greece surged after the European Central Bank launched a $750 billion euro ($820 billion) debt-buying program to keep borrowing costs in check as countries prepare to increase spending to counter the impact of the coronavirus.
Yields plummeted, led by a more than 200-basis-point drop for Greece’s five-year bonds, narrowing the gap between the debt of the euro-area’s strongest economies and the more stressed. The region’s corporate debt risk dropped the most since 2016.
The ECB decision in an unscheduled meeting on Wednesday night is the latest in an escalating global response to an outbreak widely seen driving the economy into recession. President Christine Lagarde reinforced the message that policy makers will do all they can, saying there are “no limits to our commitment to the euro.”
“The ECB was forced to react quickly,” Christoph Rieger, head of fixed-rate strategy at  Commerzbank AG  (DE:CBKG), wrote in a note to clients. “The new envelope of 750 billion euros should help bring in spreads more lastingly, but it is questionable whether this will be the turning point of the broader financial market rout.”
European stocks rose, but the euro was down 0.4% at $1.0874 as of 8:30 a.m in London.

European officials are weighing activating a regional bailout fund to help nations with strained public finances. Investors have been pushing up bond yields as they fret about the cost of the massive fiscal response to the pandemic. Italy, which already has a huge debt burden and is the worst-affected by the disease, is especially hard hit.
The ECB last week agreed to pump more liquidity into the financial system and joined other central banks in a bid to ease a funding squeeze. The measures on Wednesday include:
Buying public and private-sector securities until at least the end of 2020Program will cover all assets eligible under current quantitative-easing program, and will be extended to commercial papers of sufficient credit qualityGreek government debt will be includedCollateral standards will be easedProgram will continue until ECB judges the crisis phase of the pandemic to be over, but not before the end of this yearThe ECB will consider raising its self-imposed limits on QE holdings, and will increase the size of its programs if neededWhile the package was broadly welcomed, many said more needs to be done, particularly from governments.
“We think we still need further fiscal easing and indications of absorbing private credit risk to stabilize financial markets more durably,” said Ebrahim Rahbari, Citigroup’s global head of currency analysis.
In its statement, the central bank said it “will not tolerate any risks to the smooth transmission of its monetary policy in all jurisdictions of the euro area.”
Venturing into the commercial-paper market is a novelty for the institution. In doing so, policy makers are taking a page out of the Federal Reserve’s book.
The decision to consider raising the limits on QE holdings could be controversial. The caps, set at the start of the program in 2015, are meant to address concerns the central bank would breach European Union law by financing governments.
Lagarde’s predecessor, Mario Draghi, argued last year the Governing Council could loosen standards if economic circumstances warrant it. Taking that step in the immediate future faces one key complication -- a German constitutional court ruling on the legality of QE is just weeks away.
“Within the realm of what monetary policy can do, the ECB is now seriously tackling the two key issues facing economic policymakers,” said Holger Schmieding at Berenberg. “Easing the liquidity crunch in the economy and helping governments to finance their response to the health emergency.”
Wednesday’s announcement came hours after French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire called on the ECB to intervene “quickly and massively” using all its instruments.
If euro-area officials were to activate the region’s bailout fund, that would be a crucial step toward triggering the ECB’s most powerful bond-buying power -- Outright Monetary Transactions. That program was designed during the bloc’s debt crisis in 2012 to purchase the debt of specific nations.
It grew out of Draghi’s “whatever it takes” pledge, but has never been used.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Shares of SoftBank Group Corp (T:9984) closed down 17% on Thursday in their biggest one-day fall, hammered by investor scepticism over the outlook for tech bets, such as office sharing firm WeWork and ridehailer Uber (N:UBER).
As economic gloom grows over a coronavirus outbreak, SoftBank racked up the second biggest fall in the benchmark index (N225), breaking the 3,000-yen level to close at 2,687 yen.
The one-day fall is greater than during the bursting of the dot-com bubble, which evaporated most of Chief Executive Officer Masayoshi Son's wealth, as his plans to build a tech investing empire via the $100 billion Vision Fund stutter.
Uber's shares closed down 22% overnight as people around the world stay home to try and slow the spread of the virus.
SoftBank is considering pulling out of a $3 billion tender offer for WeWork, sources said. The startup has taken long property leases but is exposed to customers pulling out of short co-working contracts as the economy deteriorates.
""WeWork is very likely finished as a viable business,"" analyst Kirk Boodry wrote in a note on the Smartkarma platform, adding that ""Softbank faces a third straight quarter of losses for Vision Fund."""

Investing.com - Qantas Airways Ltd (ASX:QAN) said it is scrapping all international flights from late March until at least the end of May as travel demands continued to cease.
 
Two-thirds of Qantas’ employees will be temporarily idled, the airline said on Thursday. 
 
“Demand has evaporated,” Qantas Chief Executive Officer Alan Joyce said in a note to employees. “We have no work for most of our people. We have to make difficult decisions to guarantee the future of the national carrier.”
 
It was the airline’s fifth round of reductions in less than a month. Today’s announcement came just two days after Qantas said it is cutting its international capacity by 90%.
Sydney-based consultancy CAPA Centre for Aviation warned in a statement this week that the virus pandemic could potentially bankrupt most airlines globally by the end of May if governments and authorities do not take coordinated steps to avoid such a situation. 
 “Coordinated government and industry action is needed — now — if catastrophe is to be avoided,” CAPA said. Otherwise, “emerging from the crisis will be like entering a brutal battlefield, littered with casualties.""
Qantas’ shares plunged 15.8% to A$2.13 by 1:15 AM ET (05:15 GMT).

1064,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 18, 2020 11:46PM ET</span>",Tough Days May Lie Ahead for One of Asia’s Worst Equity Markets,"(Bloomberg) -- Follow Bloomberg on LINE messenger for all the business news and analysis you need.
Thailand, one of Asia’s worst major equity markets this year, has suffered from the trade war, a severe drought and a delay in the government’s budget. Yet worse may lie ahead as the coronavirus pandemic triggers closures of cinemas, schools, sports clubs, gymnasiums and restaurants, with many people working from home.
Southeast Asia’s second-largest economy has seen a surge in new infections in the past week as confirmed cases tripled to more than 200 patients, according to health-ministry data. Concerns that the disease will weigh on Thai equities, with foreign funds increasing withdrawals, according to LH Securities Co. The benchmark stock index is heading for its steepest quarterly loss since 1998.
Thailand’s worst drought in several decades, the government’s budget delay and a strong currency had already curbed the economic expansion before the disease known as Covid-19 decimated tourism, the only remaining major growth driver. At 30%, the country has the highest odds of recession among Asian nations after Japan, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The bleak economic and corporate earnings outlooks have hammered Thai equities, with slides in the benchmark index triggering trading halts on March 12 and 13. Wide price swings pushed the stock exchange on Wednesday to narrow the permissible trading range for individual stocks and revise circuit breakers to limit future drops.
Swings in the Thai stock index have jumped to their highest levels since 2008. The global pandemic will continue to keep the local equity market volatile, according to a March 17 note by Tisco Asset Management Co.
Still, Tisco Asset recommended investors begin raising their holdings of domestic shares following the slide in valuations. Dividend yields relative to the return on the government’s bonds have also boosted their allure, it said. The 4.5% dividend yield projected for companies in the Thai index is at its highest level since January 2009 relative to that on the government’s 10-year debt.
The sell-off has been so overwhelming that the proportion of stock-index constituents touching their lowest price in at least a year hit an all-time high. More than 80% of the 602 members traded at a low on March 13, the most since Bloomberg began collecting data in 2002.

1066,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 18, 2020 10:15PM ET</span>",Risk premium on U.S. investment-grade credit triples on virus worries,"By Kate Duguid
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Concerns about the impact of the coronavirus on corporate America's balance sheets has tripled the premium investors are demanding to hold even the highest-rated corporate bonds. 
The difference between the average yield of investment-grade U.S. bonds over virtually risk-free Treasuries widened to 303 basis points (bps) on Wednesday, according to the ICE/BofA investment grade index. That's up from 101 bps at the start of the year and the highest since July 2009. 
For riskier high-yield securities, the average spread over Treasuries on Wednesday was 904 bps, the highest since October 2011, and more than 2-1/2 times the rate at the start of the year, using the ICE/BofA high-yield index.
The coronavirus has walloped earnings in sectors affected by reduced travel - including airlines, casinos and hotels - but also those dependent on discretionary spending as customers spend more time indoors and earn less money. Companies with supply chains in China have also been affected. 
This hit to earnings has come at a time when U.S. corporate debt is near all-time highs, as is the size of the so-called triple-B segment of the market - companies one notch above junk status.
With their cash flow dwindling, those companies will need to depend more on funding markets. But the cost to borrow in those has risen in recent weeks; less access to cash puts these companies at a greater risk of downgrade. 
Moody's Investors Service expects somewhere between 16% and 45% of North American companies to be negatively affected by the pandemic. 
Investment-grade and high-yield exchange-traded funds have also fallen in recent weeks because of the negative outlook for companies.
The iShares iBoxx High Yield Corporate Bond ETF has fallen 18% this year, while the same company's investment grade fund is down nearly 14%. Short interest in both has also risen, with the cost to borrow shares of LQD currently at a six-year high, according to Samuel Pierson, director of securities finance at IHS Markit. 
The Markit high-yield credit-default swap index - widely used as a gauge of sentiment about high-yield debt - saw its bid spread surge to its highest since 2009 on Wednesday. The equivalent investment-grade CDS index saw its bid spread rise to its highest since 2011.

1068,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 18, 2020 09:46PM ET</span>",Just another trading day: Wild swings and dash for cash trigger selling,"By Karen Brettell, Megan Davies and Karen Pierog
(Reuters) - Another day of massive swings across asset prices was marked by scant liquidity as investors dashed for cash while systematic strategies triggered automated selling amid rising volatility, market participants said.
Wall Street deepened its selloff, with the S&P 500 now down about 29% from its Feb. 19 record high, while U.S. Treasury yields surged. The market has been swinging wildly since the coronavirus started spreading in the United States.
“I really believe that most of what’s going on in the bond market is liquidations to offset losses in equities,"" said Tom di Galoma, managing director at Seaport Global Holdings in New York.
""We’ve seen a massive decoupling of the ‘risk off’ trade, where stocks trade off, bond prices would rise, which leads me to believe that liquidations are taking place, raising as much money as they possibly can,” he said.
As the spread of the coronavirus forces businesses to shut and people to hunker down at home, some companies are facing cashflow or credit problems. That has caused a massive repricing of stocks and bonds that has hit trades that relied on low volatility and rising stocks.
""People are selling what they can sell"" such as high-quality bonds, because other assets are less liquid if they need to raise cash, said Jim Caron, senior global fixed income portfolio manager at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Investment Management.
Some of the selling pressure of the last few days' trading was blamed on systematic trades, including a numbers-crunching investment strategy called risk parity that takes long positions in both stocks and bonds. But while such strategies aim to spread risk out among asset classes, prolonged volatility can push their automated programs to begin selling all at once, adding fuel to a decline.
“Risk parity was the trigger for a lot of these moves,” said Ryan Fitzmaurice, commodities strategist at Rabobank. “You are in this environment where it is machines against machines.”
Managers of risk parity funds have said their strategies are not responsible for the recent swings.
“The trading done by risk parity managers, especially on a daily basis, is trivial in the context of markets and is having no impact,” said Michael Mendelson, principal at AQR Capital Management.
Risk parity is most associated with Bridgewater Associates LP, the world’s largest hedge fund, which has its risk-parity All Weather Fund. Bridgewater’s All Weather (12% vol) fund net performance this year was down about 14%, according to a letter sent to clients on Wednesday. Bridgewater did not respond to a request for comment.
Assets managed by risk parity strategies total between $300 billion and $400 billion,  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) strategists estimate. That compares to $17 trillion for the overall U.S. Treasury market and an equities market of around $21 trillion. A wider measure of strategies that react to changes in volatility totals about $1 trillion, analysts estimate.
An onslaught of selling from these funds could be enough to deepen market declines, some investors said.
Nick Maroutsos, co-head of global bonds at Janus Henderson Investors, said the illiquidity was partly due to “the unwind of the risk parity trade, investors trying to hedge in a very broken market,"" and other factors.
Where it ends, few are willing to guess - beyond predicting it will be when the coronavirus numbers are under control and hoping that actions by the Federal Reserve to pump liquidity into the system eventually work.
""I think a lot of the maneuvers they've made in the last little while will unleash an unholy amount of capital from bank market makers,"" said Guy LeBas, chief fixed-income strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott. ""It just takes a little time to work its way into the system."""
1069,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 18, 2020 09:37PM ET</span>",Boeing-Embraer deal on knife-edge as markets tumble,"By Tim Hepher, Marcelo Rochabrun and Eric M. Johnson
PARIS/SAO PAULO/SEATTLE (Reuters) - Brazil has upheld proposals by  Boeing Co  (N:BA) to buy the jetmaking arm of Embraer (SA:EMBR3), but plunging markets have raised urgent questions over the fate of the $4.2 billion deal as aviation reels from the coronavirus crisis.
Brazil's anti-trust watchdog dismissed prosecutors' objections to the politically sensitive deal on Wednesday.
A slump in Embraer shares and cash concerns at Boeing driven by the impact of the coronavirus on air travel dealt a blow to the deal's fragile economics, however, compounding uncertainty caused by delays in winning European Union regulatory approval.
Shares in the world's third-largest planemaker fell 14% on Wednesday, giving it a market value of about $1.3 billion after falling by two thirds since the deal was first aired in 2018, according to Refinitiv Eikon data.
At such prices, Boeing would gain control of the commercial unit of Embraer but only after paying three times the value of the whole company, which also makes military and business jets.
Boeing has offered to pay $4.2 billion in cash for 80% of Embraer's commercial unit, which builds jetliners in the 70- to 150-seat segment and competes with the Canadian-designed A220 programme recently acquired by Europe's Airbus.
Recent trends ""have increased the chances that this deal does not get done,"" Canaccord Genuity analyst Ken Herbert said.
At stake is a key plank of Boeing's strategy for expanding its engineering and industrial base just as it faces talks over $60 billion of U.S. support for the U.S. aerospace industry.
While Boeing could, analysts note, seek a lower price, pledges baked into the deal during months of sensitive negotiations leave Embraer's shareholders little room for manoeuvre barring a sharp rebound. 
Embraer plans to pay a $1.6 billion special dividend to its shareholders out of the proceeds from the transaction.
After allowing for taxes, the plan would place Embraer's commercial arm led by John Slattery in a new Boeing-led venture competing with Airbus's A220 and keep aside some $1 billion of net cash for Embraer's remaining defence and private-jet units.Embraer's battered market value threatens to upend those calculations, barring an unlikely decision to forego the special dividend or saddle the old Embraer with debt, analysts said.
SUPPORT PLAN
Boeing's new chief executive, Dave Calhoun, said in January he was committed to the deal. He must now convince Boeing's board to pursue it while also facing critics in Congress who are questioning how potential U.S. taxpayer funds would be deployed.
""They are going to Washington with their hands out for a bailout and then on the other hand looking at spending $4.2 billion to complete the deal,"" Herbert said.
Calhoun's $7 million performance bonus, part of a three-year package tethered to Boeing's share price, hangs in part on his ability to close the Embraer deal, assuming regulatory approval.
""We don’t comment publicly on discussions between the parties or market speculation. We are addressing the regulatory approvals process and outstanding closing conditions,"" a Boeing spokeswoman said.
Embraer declined to comment.
Embraer's options should the deal fail have not been widely discussed and potential alliance partners are scarce.
Before the health scare hammered markets, some airlines had urged the EU to lift what then seemed the only serious obstacle to the deal, fearing Embraer's jetliner business would struggle on its own now that Airbus owns a competitor.
But Embraer has expressed confidence in its portfolio and continues to push hard to market its latest plane, the E195-E2, which it showcased in England this week.

Brazil’s  Azul SA  (N:AZUL), the top customer for Embraer’s new line of jets, said last week it could delay some orders due to the coronavirus crisis, putting stress on the planemaker that was counting on its star customer to help market the aircraft.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Harley-Davidson Inc (N:HOG) faces a battle with one of its investors after Impala Asset Management said on Wednesday it will try to install two directors at America's oldest and best-known motorcycle maker. 
The $2.8 billion hedge fund run by Robert Bishop, which owns 1.9 million Harley shares, or 1.2% of the company, has nominated former auto industry executive Brent Dewar and Leo Hindery, Jr., who has public board experience, as directors to Harley's nine member board.
Harley has rejected the two men, saying in a filing that they would not bring fresh skills and declining to settle with Impala when the hedge fund first approached the company about new nominations to the board. 
Impala has criticized the company for losing market share and the board for being slow fixing poor returns. It also pushed for the ouster of former CEO Matt Levatich in January.
""Impala approached the Board and advocated for the removal of then-CEO Levatich and a modest refresh of the Board itself. We believed then, and still believe, that the Company underperformed its potential under Mr. Levatich and that the Board should have taken action on its own,"" the hedge fund said in a filing.
Harley tapped long-time board member Jochen Zeitz as interim CEO on Feb. 28.
A German passport holder, Zeitz's appointment came just days before U.S. President Donald Trump banned some travel from Europe amid the spread of the coronavirus that has sent markets reeling and killed more than 8,700 people so far.
The motorcycle maker said in a statement on Wednesday an employee in one of its manufacturing facilities in Wisconsin had tested positive for the coronavirus, and that it would shut majority of the production at its facilities in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin starting March 18 through March 29. 
Automakers  Ford Motor Co  (N:F), General Motors Co (N:GM) and  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles NV (N:FCAU) (MI:FCHA) also confirmed they will shut down U.S. plants to stop the virus' spread.
Meanwhile, like other Harley executives, Zeitz is working remotely and is communicating by video. In one sent to the company's dealers and seen by Reuters, he said he is ""hitting the ground running."" 
A company spokeswoman said Zeitz is ""in the process of moving to Milwaukee,"" where Harley is headquartered. She declined to offer more details.
Zeitz, a former CEO of German apparel and footwear maker Puma, has lead a push for sustainability at Harley and was a force behind The Live Wire, the company's first production of an electric bike.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Qantas Airways Ltd (AX:QAN) said on Thursday it will halt all international flights from late March until at least the end of May and is putting two-thirds of its workforce on leave after Australia told citizens not to travel overseas due to the coronavirus.
Qantas will also delay the payment of its dividend, worth A$201 million ($116.24 million), from April 9 until Sept. 1. Senior executives and the board will take a 100% pay cut until at least the end of the financial year, up from 30% earlier, joining the chairman and CEO in taking no pay.
""This is a terrible day that we have to make these decisions on the survival of the national carrier,"" Qantas Chief Executive Alan Joyce told reporters. ""I never thought as a CEO I would have to stand down two-thirds of our people and maybe more if this continues this way.""
The airline is grounding 160 planes, including all of its Airbus (PA:AIR) A380s and  Boeing Co  (N:BA) 747s and 787s as travel demand collapses. Shares were down 7% in early trade.
Qantas needs to slash its A$4 billion a year wage bill due to the drop in revenue and is looking to secure funding against its 787 fleet, with a deal expected to be announced next week, Chief Financial Officer Vanessa Hudson said.
Qantas enters the crisis in a stronger financial position than most airlines globally. Citi analysts said on Wednesday that the Australian airline could withstand six to 11 months of no flying at all before having to resort to further cost base reductions, increasing gearing or raising equity.
""We have one of the healthiest balance sheets out there so we will have plenty of liquidity to last a very, very long time,"" Joyce said.
The airline will cut its domestic capacity by 60% and 20,000 workers will not be needed. To preserve as many jobs as possible over the longer term, it is telling staff to use their paid leave and offering other options like leave at half pay and advance leave, though it said leave without pay was inevitable for some employees.
Qantas said it is also talking to partners like Australian retailer Woolworths Group Ltd (AX:WOW), which has seen a surge in sales due to panic buying from consumers worried about the coronavirus, about temporary job opportunities.
Qantas said some ad hoc international flights were possible during the period when it is halting scheduled flights, and it is in talks with the government about continuing some strategic links. It added essential domestic, regional and freight connections will be maintained as much as possible."
1072,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 18, 2020 07:53PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch for March 19,"By Kim Khan 
Investing.com - The U.S. stock market tumbled and, although closing well off the lows, it was no surprise for anyone watching the activity recently.
Wall Street is stuck in a yo-yo or unprecedented scale: a thousand Dow points here, a thousand Dow points there.
The difference between today and Tuesday is that the U.S. government focused on economic help and focused on medical health today. The stock market needs numbers, however callous that may seem.
Here are three things that could move the market tomorrow.
1. Take Two on Federal Help
The Senate passed the first of what Wall Street hopes is more stimulus bills, giving the OK to an $8.3 billion initial package passed by the House.
But investors are looking to the second move from the federal government.
The administration is looking at a $1 trillion package to soften the economic impact from Covid-19 that includes direct payment to taxpayers, federal tax relief and money for the airline industry and other affected sectors of the economy.
Progress and details on this could help the yo-yo return to the hands of the bulls.
2. {10|Dash}} for Cash to Keep Dollar Rising?
The dollar surged to a three-year high on Wednesday, on growing investor demand for cash amid fears of a liquidity squeeze as worries mount about a looming recession from the impact of the coronavirus pandemic.
The demand for the greenback comes as investors worry about potential dollar-funding issues amid the “most unexpected recession in modern times,” suggested Paul Meggyesi, head of FX strategy at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in London.
But efforts from global central banks to provide dollar liquidity through measures such as swap lines will likely ease concerns.
The US Dollar Index, which measures the greenback against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, rose to three-year high of 101.74 on Wednesday before pairing some losses.
A rally for the dollar on Thursday could see it re-test the April 2017 highs of 101.34, before making a move for the 102 handle.
3. Philly Fed Gives Some March Data
March economic data is starting to arrive, which will give investors a better idea of how the novel coronavirus pandemic is hitting the economy.
The Philadelphia Federal Reserve will report its monthly measure of manufacturing at 8:30 AM ET (12:30 GMT).
The March Philly Fed index is expected to come in at a reading of 10, well down from 36.7 in February."

(Reuters) - As Wall Street extended its deep sell-off on Wednesday over fears about the coronavirus, the Dow Jones Industrial Average effectively erased the last of the once sizeable gains it made under U.S. President Donald Trump.
Trump's request for Congress to approve $500 billion in cash payments to taxpayers along with $50 billion in loans for airlines failed to stem the bleeding in the stock market, where the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) tumbled almost 11% before partly recovering to end down 6.3%.
Trump has repeatedly boasted about and taken credit for the stock market's performance during his three years in office, including as recently as last Saturday after a strong rebound the day before. Trump has also warned that Wall Street would fall if a Democratic candidate wins the November presidential election.
By Wednesday's close, the Dow was up just 0.4% from where it was on Jan. 20, 2017, the day of Trump's inauguration. The Dow is still up almost 9% from when Trump unexpectedly won the presidential election on Nov. 8, 2016. 
Measuring the stock market's performance under the Republican president beginning at his election date captures a surge immediately after he won, dubbed the Trump Bump, as investors became optimistic about Trump's promises to cut taxes and reduce regulations.
At its February peak, the Dow had surged more than 60% from Trump's election day.
The S&P 500, a broader measure of the U.S. stock market, tumbled 5.2% on Wednesday, leaving it up just 12% since Trump's 2016 election and up 6% from his inauguration. At its peak, the S&P 500 had gained 58% since Trump's election. 

Overall, the S&P 500 has slumped nearly 30% from its Feb. 19 peak and ended a bull market that began in 2009.

S&P 500 futures reversed losses to rise about 2% and the euro edged up. The ECB launched a new temporary program worth 750 billion euros ($820 billion). Wall Street suffered another plunge Wednesday as investor focus turned to the possible length of the coronavirus-driven downturn. Oil rose to take back some of Wednesday’s 24% plunge that left prices at an 18-year low.
In currencies earlier, the Bloomberg dollar index surged to an all-time high as investors sought to raise cash. The pound hit its lowest level against the greenback since 1985.
“The outlook has changed pretty dramatically even in the last few days,” Alicia Levine, chief strategist at BNY Mellon, told Bloomberg TV. “We’re looking at a sudden stop globally, so the probability of a global recession has gone up remarkably.”
Meantime, the U.S. Senate cleared the second major bill responding to the coronavirus pandemic and White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said the government might take an equity position as part of an aid package. Australia is expected on Thursday to announce a quantitative easing package.
“We still have downside room in the stock market,” Scott Minerd, co-founder and global chief investment officer at Guggenheim Partners, told Bloomberg TV. “Until we see some forced liquidation -- which for the first time today I have a sense we are seeing -- we are not going to come to a bottom.”
Oil on Wednesday dropped below $25 a barrel for the first time since 2003 in London and tumbled 24% in New York after Saudi Arabia signaled it’s doubling down on a price war with Russia just as demand evaporates with the spreading coronavirus.

As governments around the world impose restrictions on public life to try to contain the spread of the coronavirus, Hugo Boss said it had closed a large number of its retail stores as well as many concessions in Europe and North America.
Zara-owner  Inditex  (MC:ITX), the world's biggest fashion retailer, said earlier on Wednesday the coronavirus pandemic had dealt a significant blow to its business, with sales in the first two weeks of March plunging 24.1% and nearly half its stores temporarily closed around the world.
Hugo Boss said the impact of store closures to its sales and earnings was impossible to quantify at this point, but it was abandoning the outlook it gave on March 5.
Hugo Boss had warned then that the coronavirus would have a significant impact on its first-quarter results, with sales falling particularly in Asia, but had said it expected a gradual normalization by the middle of the year.
On Wednesday, it said it has initiated extensive measure to protect its free cash flow, including significantly curtailing the inflow of new goods and suspending store renovations and new openings.
But it said it remained optimistic that its brands should return to profitable growth quickly as soon as the situation has normalized."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks deepened their selloff on Wednesday and the Dow effectively erased the last of its gains since U.S. President Donald Trump's 2017 inauguration, as repercussions of the coronavirus pandemic threatened to cripple economic activity.
The benchmark S&P 500 index ended off of its lows of the session but still down 5.2%, extending the recent plunge that ended Wall Street's longest-ever bull run. The S&P 500 is now down about 29% from its Feb. 19 record closing high.
With airports and hotels emptying and airlines asking staff to take unpaid leave to stem losses, the S&P 1500 airlines index <.SPCOMAIR> sank 20.8%. Shares in Hilton (N:HLT), Marriott (O:MAR) and Hyatt (N:H) hotels fell by about 12% to 19%.
""The market's really reacting to fear and uncertainty and we don't think it's over until it finds a floor on stock prices. The floor will have to be found in containment of the viral spread and limiting the economic toll of the virus,"" said Nela Richardson, investment strategist at Edward Jones.
Trump's request for Congress to approve $500 billion in cash payments to taxpayers along with $50 billion in loans for airlines did little to stem the rout.
In one of the most dire forecasts yet issued for the potential hit from the coronavirus epidemic, a JP Morgan economist said the U.S. economy could shrink 4% this quarter and 14% next quarter, and for the year it is likely to shrink 1.5%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) fell 1,338.46 points, or 6.3%, to 19,898.92, the S&P 500 (SPX) lost 131.09 points, or 5.18%, to 2,398.1 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) dropped 344.94 points, or 4.7%, to 6,989.84.
The day's selling at one point triggered another 15-minute trading cutout at a 7% decline in yet another day of volatile trading. The Cboe Volatility index (VIX) ended up at 76.45.
The S&P 500's collapse into a bear market, among the fastest in history, has prompted some calls for a pause in trading.
""This market went from a position of where we were fearless back at the beginning of February to some days like today where you feel hopeless about what's going on in the market,"" said Wayne Wicker, chief investment officer of Vantagepoint Investment Advisers. 

U.S. crude futures fell nearly 17% on Wednesday having touched their lowest in 18 years, while the S&P 500 energy sector (SPNY) closed at its lowest since early 2003.

1080,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 18, 2020 04:48PM ET</span>",U.S. airlines shares plunge after cash-free Washington rescue proposal,"By Tracy Rucinski and David Shepardson
CHICAGO/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Shares in U.S. airlines fell sharply on Wednesday after Washington proposed a rescue package of $50 billion in loans, but no grants as the industry had requested, to help address the financial impact from the deepening coronavirus crisis.
The Trump administration's lending proposal would require airlines to maintain a certain amount of service and limit increases in executive compensation until the loans are repaid.
The largest U.S. airlines --  American Airlines Group  Inc (O:AAL), Delta Air Lines Inc (N:DAL) and United Airlines Holdings Inc (O:UAL) -- are drastically reducing flights, parking jets, raising capital and cutting costs including executive pay as part of measures to save cash as air travel demand takes an unprecedented downturn.
But the industry says government assistance is also needed to avoid collapse, airlines are working behind the scenes to convince lawmakers to still make a significant chunk of it in grants.
Their request for aid has faced pushback from some lawmakers demanding that any government package include protections on employees and a ban on share buybacks. The top five U.S. airlines spent around $44 billion in share buybacks between 2014 and 2019, according to data compiled by Reuters, spurred in part by a 2017 tax-cut windfall.
Democratic lawmakers, including U.S. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer, said that money could have been put into a rainy day fund.
Democratic Senator Chris Murphy said Wednesday that sentiment is shifting over a rescue package because ""there is no straight-face justification to give no-strings-attached cash to an industry that had the chance to use massive profits and tax cuts to build a rainy day fund, but instead used the money to pad investor returns and executive pay.""
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Twitter that ""any money should come with serious long-term change to the companies - no more buybacks, a $15 minimum wage, and more.""
In their push for aid, airlines have touted the role their services will play in revamping the global economy.
""When this pandemic passes – and it will – air travel will play a major role in getting life back to normal and supporting economic recovery. We are going to need significant government help to do that,"" JetBlue Airways Chief Executive Robin Hayes and President Joanna Geraghty said in a memo on Wednesday.
JetBlue (O:JBLU) said its customer cancel rate was more than 10 times the norm, forcing it to suspend more flights and review its fleet plans.
Delta on Wednesday said it was parking more than 600 jets and scaling back its flying by more than 70% until demand begins to recover, with revenues seen declining by $2 billion in March.
Delta Chief Executive Ed Bastian, who likened the steps to hitting a ""pause button"" on operations, said in a memo to employees he was optimistic about industry support from the White House and Congress but would continue taking ""all necessary self-help measures.""
Delta shares closed lost 26% lower, while United stock was down 30% and American 25%.
U.S. airline and flight attendant groups, trying to prevent tens of thousands of job losses, were also supporting companies' push for aid.
""Our focus is on saving the industry and doing it in a way that is worker focused,"" Sara Nelson, president of the Association of Flight Attendants union representing 20 airlines including United, told Reuters.
Meanwhile, business and industry events continued to ground to a halt.
Two European air shows - the Berlin Airshow and Geneva's EBACE business-jet convention - have been canceled, organizers said on Wednesday, leaving uncertainty over this year's main industry showcase, the Farnborough Airshow in July.
Organizers of the British event are in a wait-and-see mode so far."

Investing.com – The Dow closed below 20,000 for the first time in three years, dragged down by energy after oil prices plunged to an 18-year low on Wednesday amid a precarious future for the travel industry and the broader economy as the Covid-19 pandemic gathers pace.
The Dow fell 6.3%, or 1,335 points to 19.902, the S&P 500 slumped 5.2% and the Nasdaq Composite fell 4.7%. The Dow has wiped out nearly all the gains since President Donald Trump was inaugurated. The Dow stood at 19,827.247 on Jan. 20, 2017.  
Oil prices settled 24% lower in their biggest daily rout since 2002 amid ongoing fears about weaker demand at the time when the travel industry has been under pressure following the novel coronavirus outbreak.
The selloff in the broader market comes even as reports suggested that the U.S. lawmakers were making on progress on a stimulus package worth about $1.3 trillion that would increase numerous initiates to support the economy, including checks to qualifying Americans, and bailouts to airlines.
The Senate, meanwhile, is set to pass the House bill from last week to expand paid leave and unemployment benefits.
But those efforts are unlikely to stop a deep economic fallout, with Hedge fund founder Bill Ackman insisting that closing the country down for 30 days is the only option to contain the coronavirus outbreak.
U.S. GDP could fall 4% this quarter and 14% next quarter, and for the year is likely to shrink 1.5%, J.P. Morgan warned on Wednesday.

1083,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 18, 2020 04:01PM ET</span>",Explainer: How sham trades tricked Germany out of billions,"By John O'Donnell
BONN (Reuters) - Two British bankers were handed suspended jail sentences on Wednesday and one told to pay a 14 million euro penalty in Germany's biggest post-war fraud trial of a scam involving multi-billion-euro trades to get bogus tax reclaims.
One of the bankers, Martin Shields, an Oxford graduate, told the court he had ""learned his lesson"".
Shields was ordered to pay a 14 million euro penalty.
Throughout the trial, he gave detailed presentations to explain the scheme's workings to the judges.
Nicholas Diable told judges that his wedding, honeymoon, career and birth of his children had been overshadowed by the investigation, expressing regret that he had taken part in the so-called ""cum-ex"" scheme.
The German prosecutors intend to use the case as the foundation for scores of further trials in a wider pan-German push to recover billions of euros from banks and investors.
The trial, as well as recent raids in Frankfurt and the arrest of a lawyer involved in the case, have been closely followed in London and Frankfurt, where much of the trading was organized, bankers said and court documents showed.
HOW DID IT WORK?
Shields revealed much about the workings of the trade during the trial, making presentations to the Bonn court explaining how the scheme, known as ""cum ex"", thrived between 2005 and 2012.
It allowed investors around the world to target chiefly German companies to generate multiple tax reclaims from phantom dividends. This went on for years, including during the financial crash when many banks were bailed out by the state.
The trade required a syndicate of big banks and investors, such as hedge funds, to work in tandem to engineer the trades.
DIVIDEND ARBITRAGE
The ""cum-ex"" trades are a mutation of a multi-billion-euro business called dividend arbitrage, bankers and finance industry experts say.
Here is how dividend arbitrage works. European countries sometimes impose a higher or lower tax on company dividends paid to shareholders, depending on who and where they are.
A London hedge fund may have to pay a higher German withholding tax when it gets a dividend payout on shares in a German car-maker than a pension fund in Munich.
To avoid the heavy German tax, the London fund lends the shares to the Munich pension before the dividend payout. The German fund then pays a lower tax and the shares switch back to the London investor. The saving is split. This is legal.
VIRTUAL DIVIDENDS
In Germany, a glitch in the mechanics of trading and reclaiming withholding tax made it possible to generate virtual dividends by short-selling stocks. That triggered a voucher to reclaim tax that had never been paid. This is illegal.
Once discovered by the global finance sector, the trading took on vast proportions.
Carefully orchestrated, shares would be rapidly moved around a group of banks and investors to give the impression of numerous owners, each entitled to a tax rebate.
GERMAN REACTION
The trades were so complicated, they long remained hidden. After roughly a decade, they finally attracted the attention of German tax authorities, who slowly stamped it out. Denmark too lost money to such bogus tax reclaims.
When the wider German public became aware of the trading schemes this prompted a heated debate, a parliamentary enquiry and a pledge from Berlin to get the money back.
The government has put a tally on the damage of 5 billion euros, although some experts say it could be twice as much. And with many of those involved scattered around the world, recovering the cash is difficult.
LEGAL OR ILLEGAL?
Some bankers involved said that the practice was such common knowledge among peers that they believed the German government was also aware of it.
But German government officials dismiss this as absurd. They point to attempts to stamp out the practice by changing and clarifying the law in 2007, 2009 and 2012, efforts they say made clear the trading was illegal."

CHICAGO (Reuters) - Delta Air Lines (N:DAL) said on Wednesday it was parking more than 600 jets, cutting corporate pay by as much as 50%, and scaling back its flying by more than 70% until demand begins to recover from the coronavirus epidemic hit.
In a memo to employees, Delta Chief Executive Ed Bastian said the company would continue taking ""all necessary self-help measures,"" with cash preservation the top priority, even as it remains optimistic of industry support from the White House and Congress.
The Trump administration on Wednesday proposed $50 billion in loans for U.S. airlines, according to a document seen by Reuters, with requirements including limits on increases in executive compensation until the loans are repaid.
Some Democratic lawmakers - eager to avoid mistakes they say were made after the September 2001 attacks - have demanded additional requirements, including protections for employees and a ban on share buybacks.
Delta said its officers will take a 50% pay cut through June 30 while board members forgo pay for the next six months. Bastian has already given up his salary for the next six months.

With fewer customers flying, the company is consolidating airport facilities in Atlanta and other locations, closing the majority of its Delta Sky Clubs, and reducing other spending in an effort to save more than $4 billion in cash in the second quarter.

The S&P 500 fell more than 7%, triggering a 15-minute pause, with stocks adding to losses when trading resumed. The next halt would occur at a 13% decline. The Dow Jones Industrial Average wiped out all the gains logged since Donald Trump’s inauguration, dropping as much as 10%, with investors craving more government spending to offset the impact from the virus.
Bonds tumbled around the world a day after Treasuries notched biggest yield jump since 1982, while municipal bonds extended the deepest rout since 1987 as markets braced for the potential flood of spending. Oil dropped to an 18-year low. The dollar strengthened a seventh straight day, while the pound hit its lowest level against the greenback since 1985.
Trump offered few details at a press briefing on the details his Treasury secretary is discussing with Congress. The Federal Reserve dusted off crisis-era programs to stabilize financial markets.
Governments have pledged or are considering massive fiscal support to offset the economic shock from the pandemic, with the Trump administration moving toward a big package, but the virus continues to spread at a pace that is forcing massive shutdowns across the globe.
“The missing fundamental ingredient for a sustainable recovery in risk appetite is some evidence that the growth of global Covid-19 infection rates is peaking,” said Paul O’Connor, head of multi-asset at Janus Henderson Investors. “Clearly, we are not there yet.”
The planned U.S. stimulus could amount to $1.2 trillion, aiming to stave off the worst impact of a crisis that already looks set to plunge many of the world’s economies into recession. Meantime, the Federal Reserve reintroduced additional crisis-era tools to stabilize financial markets. Those responses came after stresses appeared in the short-term funding markets.
“I don’t think we’re out of the woods yet in terms of liquidity,” Mark Konyn, chief investment officer at AIA Group in Hong Kong, told Bloomberg TV. “It’s a question of when the fiscal measures will have the most efficacy.”
In Germany, Angela Merkel said the government will not rule out joint European Union debt issuance to help contain the impact.

The S&P 500 fell more than 7%, triggering a 15-minute pause, with stocks adding to losses when trading resumed. The next halt would occur at a 13% decline. The Dow Jones Industrial Average wiped out all the gains logged since Donald Trump’s inauguration, dropping as much as 10%, with investors craving more government spending to offset the impact from the virus.
Bonds tumbled around the world a day after Treasuries notched biggest yield jump since 1982, while municipal bonds extended the deepest rout since 1987 as markets braced for the potential flood of spending. Oil dropped to an 18-year low. The dollar strengthened a seventh straight day, while the pound hit its lowest level against the greenback since 1985.
Trump offered few details at a press briefing on the details his Treasury secretary is discussing with Congress. The Federal Reserve dusted off crisis-era programs to stabilize financial markets.
Governments have pledged or are considering massive fiscal support to offset the economic shock from the pandemic, with the Trump administration moving toward a big package, but the virus continues to spread at a pace that is forcing massive shutdowns across the globe.
“The missing fundamental ingredient for a sustainable recovery in risk appetite is some evidence that the growth of global Covid-19 infection rates is peaking,” said Paul O’Connor, head of multi-asset at Janus Henderson Investors. “Clearly, we are not there yet.”
The planned U.S. stimulus could amount to $1.2 trillion, aiming to stave off the worst impact of a crisis that already looks set to plunge many of the world’s economies into recession. Meantime, the Federal Reserve reintroduced additional crisis-era tools to stabilize financial markets. Those responses came after stresses appeared in the short-term funding markets.
“I don’t think we’re out of the woods yet in terms of liquidity,” Mark Konyn, chief investment officer at AIA Group in Hong Kong, told Bloomberg TV. “It’s a question of when the fiscal measures will have the most efficacy.”
In Germany, Angela Merkel said the government will not rule out joint European Union debt issuance to help contain the impact.
Elsewhere, Bloomberg’s industrial-metals index dropped for a third day, with copper, nickel and aluminum among the biggest losers. Gold resumed losses as traders sold the metal to cover margin calls in other markets.

1094,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 18, 2020 02:05PM ET</span>","Trump administration wants to send taxpayers $500 billion, $50 billion in loans for airlines","By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration on Wednesday asked Congress to approve $500 billion in cash payments to taxpayers in two rounds that would start April 6 and $50 billion in secured loans to U.S. airlines to address the financial impact of the coronavirus, according to a document seen by Reuters.
The payments would be tiered based on income and family size. They would be made in two $250 billion rounds on April 6 and May 18, according to the document.
U.S. President Donald Trump said Wednesday it was not clear what the size of the checks would be. ""We are looking at different numbers,"" Trump said. ""Everybody seems to want to go big.""
Congressional leaders are in talks about the proposal. Some Senate Republicans have called for $1,000 checks for taxpayers, but Senate Democratic Leader Charles Schumer says it should be higher.
""This is not a time for small measures. This is a time to be bold, to be aggressive,"" Schumer said Wednesday, saying he wants more frequent payments targeted to those who need them most.
The administration, as part of its $1 trillion stimulus and rescue proposal, also seeks another $150 billion to aid severely distressed sectors of the economy for secured lending or loan guarantees and $300 billion in small business interruption loans. ""We want to help everybody,"" Trump said.
Officials have said that could include hotels, restaurants, aviation manufacturing, and cruise lines.  Boeing Co  (N:BA) on Wednesday said it was seeking at least $60 billion in loan guarantees and other financing for the entire aviation manufacturing sector, while cargo and passenger airlines are seeking $58 billion in loans and grants.
Trump held a call with the chief executives of Delta Air Lines (N:DAL), American Airlines (O:AAL), United Airlines (O:UAL), UPS (N:UPS) and other carriers on Wednesday.
A spokeswoman for Senator Richard Shelby, a Republican who chairs the Appropriations Committee, said he believes the ""best way to help the airlines weather this storm is to provide liquidity through collateralized lending.""
Trump ""told the airlines that they are an essential part of our daily lives and our economy, and this nation will be there to support them,"" the White House said.
Airlines would be required to set limits on executive compensation until the loans were repaid and would also have to agree to continue service. Airlines also signaled in a call on Tuesday with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi that they would agree not to use emergency loans for stock buybacks, sources briefed on the call said.
American hotel and travel industry executives from companies such as Marriott and Hilton met with Trump on Tuesday to discuss a potential $250 billion aid package, as thousands of hotel workers began furloughs due to the fast-spreading coronavirus.
The requested package would consist of $150 billion in direct aid for the hotel sector and $100 billion for related travel companies, including convention businesses, industry executives said on a call after the meeting with Trump, who made his fortune in real estate and hotels.

U.S. restaurants on Wednesday asked for a $455 billion aid package, saying that the industry could shed nearly half of its 15.6 million jobs and at least a quarter of its annual sales because of the coronavirus outbreak.

(Reuters) - Bridgewater Associates LP, the Ray Dalio-led hedge fund giant famous for making money during the 2008 financial crisis, has posted double-digit losses so far this year amid sharp market declines sparked by the coronavirus outbreak, according to a note sent to clients on Wednesday and seen by Reuters.
Through March 16, Bridgewater's All Weather 12% volatility ""risk parity"" fund fell about 14% for the year; its Pure Alpha 18% volatility hedge fund declined about 21%; and its Major Markets 14% volatility hedge fund dropped about 7%, Dalio wrote.
Dalio wrote that the performance was ""not what I would want"" but was ""consistent with what I would have expected under the circumstances.""
Bridgewater has assets under management of about $160 billion, according to its website, and is trusted by some of the world's largest investors to safeguard their money no matter the economic environment.
The S&P 500 index tumbled 7% on Wednesday, triggering a 15-minute trading halt of Wall Street's main indexes for the second time this week, on fears that stimulus measures may not be enough to avert a coronavirus-driven recession.
Dalio said Bridgewater's portfolios were positioned for relative economic strength but also had hedges on in case of an unanticipated steep market decline. The firm's risk controls worked as designed, he said, adding that Bridgewater remained liquid and able to adjust its positions.
""Going forward, the world has now crossed a very dangerous threshold for financial markets and economies that poses great risks for all investors,"" Dalio wrote, citing interest rates falling below zero percent amid an economic downturn, inequality and populism.
""It is one we have been preparing for for a long time.""
CHINA RUMORS
On Wednesday, Dalio posted on popular Chinese microblogging site Weibo to dispel rumors about a Bridgewater blow-up.
“There has been a rumor going around China that Bridgewater has 'crashed' or 'is in trouble,' Dalio wrote, attaching the client note with the firm's performance and views. “You have my word that that is totally false and that Bridgewater is totally safe.”
He condemned “bad people” who spread such rumors. “I think we might have identified the rumor monger which we will pursue legally and disclose publicly if we are able.”"

Investing.com – The dollar surged to a more than a three-year high on Wednesday, helped by a massive slump in the pound and a surge in demand for the greenback as investors rack up cash amid fears about a deep recession in the global economy, led by the coronavirus pandemic.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, rose by 2.08% to 101.65, its highest level since March 2017.
The rise in the dollar comes as traders have been liquidated positions, making a dash for cash, with the dollar, in particular – being the world's reserve currency – in high demand.
""When you have the most unexpected recession we’ve seen in modern times, a lot of people are caught in dollar-funding issues,"" said Paul Meggyesi, head of FX strategy at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in London. ""This crisis is affecting every sector and every country in a synchronised way.""
GBP/USD fell to 4.01% to $1.1546.

There were no immediate reports of deaths or injuries.
The 5.7-magnitude, early morning tremor centered in north-central Utah was the strongest the state has experienced since 1992, when a 5.9-magnitude quake rattled the St. George area in Utah's southwestern corner, according to Utah Emergency Management.
The quake damaged the Angel Moroni statue atop Salt Lake Temple, the Mormon Church's largest, knocking a trumpet from the angel's hand. A church spokesman also said some of the temple's smaller spire stones were displaced, according to the Deseret News.
Utah has a large Mormon population and holds a special place in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints.
In Herriman, just south of the capital Salt Lake City, bricks from the facade of the Silver Crest Elementary School fell in front of the main entrance.
Cracks appeared in the brick facade of a Salt Lake City bank building, and rubble appeared on the sidewalk in front of an unoccupied building under construction, social media images showed.
Governor Gary Herbert said the state's poison control center at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City was evacuated while officials assessed the damage, and he said the coronavirus hotline was down.
""Please stay away from the downtown area while crews assess damage. Unless you work in public safety, or are an essential employee, remain at home or telework,"" the governor wrote on Twitter.
The Utah Department of Health said it set up a temporary hotline for information about the coronavirus.
The quake struck at 7:09 a.m. MDT (1309 GMT) some 3.7 miles (6 km) north-northeast of Magna, Utah, at a depth of 7.3 miles (11.7 km) the U.S. Geological Survey reported, and was followed by a series of smaller aftershocks.
Magna lies just to the west of Salt Lake City.
""Road to the airport has been closed. Please do not come out to the airport,"" the Salt Lake City Airport posted on Twitter.
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said it had evacuated the air traffic control tower at Salt Lake City International Airport and halted flights, diverting inbound aircraft to other airports.
The FAA’s Salt Lake Air Route Traffic Control Center, which is housed separately from the airport control tower, is handling all air traffic in the area, the agency said.
Salt Lake City is the 23rd busiest U.S. airport and a hub for Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL).
Marathon Petroleum Corp (NYSE:MPC) said its 61,000 barrel-per-day Salt Lake City refinery in Utah was evacuated after the quake.

(Reuters) - General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) will furlough all its employees in Brazil starting on March 30, the company said in a statement to Reuters on Wednesday, suggesting that GM's production in South America's main car market would stop due to the coronavirus outbreak. 
Brazil's automakers had been bracing for a potential breakdown in its parts supply chain from China starting in April that could disrupt production. But GM did not mention chain supply issues in its statement, instead pointing that it was furloughing workers to ""align production to market demands.""
GM's Chevrolet is Brazil's best-selling car brand and the company's decision could potentially lead other large Brazilian automakers to furlough and halt production themselves. 
A union source representing some of GM's workers in Brazil said they would have liked for the company to furlough workers sooner to protect their health. 
The source said the furlough would in principle last from March 30 through April 12 and workers will be paid in full, in accordance with Brazilian law. He said the agreement had yet to be formalized, but is expected to be signed later in the day.

The planned U.S. stimulus could amount to $1.2 trillion, aiming to stave off the worst impact of a crisis that already looks set to plunge many of the world’s economies into recession. Meantime, the Federal Reserve reintroduced additional crisis-era tools to stabilize financial markets. Those responses came after stresses appeared in the short-term funding markets.
“I don’t think we’re out of the woods yet in terms of liquidity,” Mark Konyn, chief investment officer at AIA Group in Hong Kong, told Bloomberg TV. “It’s a question of when the fiscal measures will have the most efficacy.”
In Germany, Angela Merkel said the government will not rule out joint European Union debt issuance to help contain the impact.
Elsewhere, Bloomberg’s industrial-metals index dropped for a third day, with copper, nickel and aluminum among the biggest losers. Gold resumed losses as traders sold the metal to cover margin calls in other markets.

1107,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 18, 2020 12:41PM ET</span>","Up 3,000%: The tail risk funds that mastered coronavirus market mayhem","By Svea Herbst-Bayliss and Lawrence Delevingne
(Reuters) - Boaz Weinstein was waiting for this. 
The New York hedge fund manager, seasoned by past financial crises and spooked by seemingly endless quarters of ever-higher markets, had for years set up for financial calamity, even if it meant sometimes poor returns. 
When panic over the coronavirus spread to global financial markets in late February, Weinstein swung into action.
Glued to a battery of computer screens to transact in three time zones for 15 hours a day, the former  Deutsche Bank  AG (DE:DBKGn) trader scored on bond and credit default swap-related bets and cashed in on old insurance-like derivatives products for a steep market decline, according to people who know him.
By Friday, Weinstein had produced the best returns in $2.7 billion Saba Capital Management LP's history. Its Tail Fund gained more than 175% through March 13; other Saba funds gained between 53% and 67%, according to a client letter reviewed by Reuters https://www.reuters.com/article/us-hedgefunds-saba/boaz-weinstein-hedge-fund-up-33-after-market-plunge-letter-idUSKBN213015.
""I certainly did not expect it to come from a virus, but I have had the conviction – for a long time – that investors needed to be ready for an extreme market decline,"" Weinstein wrote in the letter that was sent to investors on Sunday.
A spokesman for Saba declined to comment.
Saba is among a small group of firms that have scored major returns for clients in recent weeks through so-called tail risk products. 
The CBOE Eurekahedge Tail Risk Hedge Fund Index gained 14% in February alone and, combined with estimated March performance, is likely up between 32% and 41% for the year, according to a Eurekahedge analysis. See chart https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/HEALTH-CORONAVIRUS-TAILRISK/0H001R8H7CDZ/index.html
 Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) estimates that the average stock-focused hedge fund, by comparison, is down about 14% for the year through March 17, compared with a 25% benchmark stock market loss.
Tail products - including hedge funds, customized portfolios and exchange traded funds (ETFs) - typically use credit default swaps, stock options and other derivatives to profit from severe market dislocations. Generally they are cheap bets for a big, long-shot payoff that otherwise are a drag on the portfolio, much like monthly insurance policy payments. Such funds have been around since the 2008 financial crisis, but they gained limited traction by producing mixed returns during the bull market. 
'MULTIPLES' OF 1,000%
A client of Universa Investments LP, a $4.1 billion Miami-based risk mitigation specialist, saw money allocated to the firm's tail hedging strategy gain around 1,000% in February and ""multiples"" of that in March, according to Claude Bovet of Lionscrest Capital. That implies a gain of at least 3,000%; the net return on Lionscrest's total portfolio was not available. 
""This has been a great period for us and our clients,"" Universa chief investment officer Mark Spitznagel said via a spokesman, who declined to comment on performance. 
Other big winners include Capstone Investment Advisors, whose $7 billion firm runs tail risk strategies for clients that have gained 280% this year through Monday, according to a person familiar with the returns; 36 South Capital Advisors' volatility strategy, which rose 35% over January and February, according to data from  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN); and the $126 million Cambria Tail Risk ETF, which is up about 25% this year through Tuesday.
""Our tail risk products are doing exactly what they are designed to do,"" said Meb Faber, chief investment officer at El Segundo, California-based Cambria Investment Management LP.
Representatives for Capstone and 36 South declined to comment.
These types of portfolios are always popular during a crisis but when no next terrible event happens, investment managers and boards often lose patience and exit, complaining of low returns or losses. Last year, when the S&P500 stock index gained 30%, the benchmark CBOE Eurekahedge index lost 10.4%.
The gains this year are likely to spur renewed interest. Weinstein's Saba has seen $500 million come in this year and told investors that he will limit inflows into his funds to an aggregate of $1 billion for 2020. Weinstein said Saba was now ""finding extraordinary new investments"" amid the turmoil.
Winning managers were mindful that their gains came as a result of a health crisis that has sickened nearly 200,000 people around the world and killed 7,500 as of Wednesday, according to the World Health Organization (as referenced https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/685d0ace521648f8a5beeeee1b9125cd).

""We provide protection, an effective safe haven,"" said Universa's Spitznagel. ""But we certainly didn’t need nor want this tragedy to happen.""

Government payments would arrive on April 6 and May 18, in equal value, based on the an outline of the White House’s coronavirus stimulus plan obtained by Bloomberg News. The amount of the payment would be linked to income and number of children in a family.
“Payment amounts would be fixed and tiered based on income level and family size,” the Treasury department wrote in the proposal. “Treasury is modeling specific options.”
Mnuchin first outlined the proposal Tuesday in a closed-door meeting with Republican senators. One of them, Josh Hawley of Missouri, has called for payments that would be adjusted based on family size and income. Another, Mitt Romney of Utah, had supported across-the-board $1,000 checks.
Mnuchin has said the government won’t send checks to millionaires. During the meeting, Mnuchin supported means-testing the payments, an official familiar with the matter said. He also suggested Trump supported the approach, telling Hawley that there’s a person in the White House who agreed with him, without saying who, the official said.

1109,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 18, 2020 12:11PM ET</span>",Stampede to get out: bond ETFs get crushed in selloff,"By Saikat Chatterjee
LONDON (Reuters) - A rush to sell global bonds in the past week has now rippled into the world of exchange-traded funds with some of the most actively traded seeing the most bulging gaps relative to the value of underlying holdings in years.
Exchange-traded funds offer liquidity in different asset classes and have become in recent years a one-stop shop for investors and traders to access different markets and get trading liquidity in previous illiquid parts of the market.
Thanks to years of low interest rates and placid market volatility, assets held by exchange-traded funds have doubled in size in less than four years, crossing the $6 trillion mark at the end of 2019, according to fund tracker ETFGI.
More impressively, bond ETFs which were hardly present a couple of decades earlier, now make up more than a sixth of the overall market, according to industry watchers.
But the violent swings in bond markets in recent weeks has taken a toll on some of these widely traded ETFS, with their market prices diverging sharply from the value of their underlying market holdings as ETF providers struggle to transact individual bonds.
With liquidity drying up across the board, funds trying to offload any sizeable holdings are having to sell at lower prices than quoted on trading platforms, market players said.
""There is massive selling pressure on bond ETFs and funds – when you provide NAV on an over-the-counter product with very little bids similar to what you are currently seeing in the bond market, it becomes a stampede to get out,"" said a portfolio manager at a European fund in Hong Kong.
Take Vanguard's total bond market index fund (O:BND), for example, which tracks the performance of a broad, market-weighted bond index and launched in April 2007 with a market capitalization of more than $50 billion.
The gap between its net asset value or the price at which it values its holdings and the market price has widened to levels not seen since the 2008 global financial crisis.
George Saravelos, a strategist at  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) in London, said the  Barclays  (LON:BARC) U.S. aggregate bond ETF is on track to post its second worst weekly performance on record, indicative of the ongoing liquidity concerns in the bond market.
A Reuters analysis of some of the biggest bond ETFs in the European market found an average gap of 2%-11% for some of the biggest names in the bond market, with the ishares core European government bond ETF (DE:EUNH) and BNP Paribas's euro aggregate treasury bond fund seeing some of the widest gaps.
By dint of its methodology, ETF providers aim to provide market liquidity by allowing market makers to create and redeem baskets of securities aimed at replicating the value of the ETF.
While these securities can be easily traded during normal markets, in times of market stress, that liquidity creation and redemption mechanism can come under pressure as traders scramble to find securities.
Some analysts say ETFs can aggravate market selloffs as they will try to minimize the gap between their net asset values and market prices.
""ETFs are the compounding factor in this crisis as, given the redemption-creation mechanism of these ETFs, they can compound selling pressure in a falling market,"" said Alberto Gallo, head of macro strategies at London-based hedge fund Algebris Capital."

LONDON (Reuters) - The carnage in stock markets is getting uglier by the day. Should you ""buy"", ""sell"" or ""hold"" on tight?
Research houses at big investment banks who provide these recommendations on stocks are dumbfounded. Their ratings on share prices of many companies have become obsolete as markets have skidded at a record pace from bull to bear.
Most of them are waiting on the sidelines for the dust to settle, while some braver souls have come out with recommendations, only to get it wrong.
On March 6, for example, investment bank BofA moved its outlook on the European airline sector to ""overweight"", telling its clients the shares were likely to rally despite coronavirus risks.
The sector had an ""8% implied upside potential even in our (coronavirus) downside scenario,"" a note from the bank said.
Since then, European airlines' share prices have plummeted more than 40%, making the BofA call one of the many to go sour as the coronavirus fuel led a bull-to-bear shift on world markets that has been breathtaking in its speed, scope and severity.
BofA's research department was not immediately available to comment but a spokesperson said guidance to clients had not been updated since March 6.
To be fair to BofA and other banks, the coronavirus pandemic has blindsided governments, financial experts and businesses across the world, with one illustration being shortages being seen of medical gear like face masks and ventilators.
And a glance through email inboxes reveals an abundance of obsolete-sounding target prices and strategy calls from various analysts at banks. They highlight how badly most analysts, as recently as last week, also read the gathering coronavirus storm despite warning flags from the outbreak in China. 
In another painful call, Exane  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) stuck an ""outperform"" rating on Air France (PA:AIRF) on Feb. 27. 
Three weeks on, shares in the French airline are now worth 4.12 euros down from 7.7 euros that day.
""We do use sell side inputs for particular things, but have our own research strategists and we do a lot of modeling within the team,"" said Justin Onuekwusi, portfolio manager at Legal & General.
""Many analysts got it wrong, the impact of the shutdown, maybe they didn't fully understand the domino effect of (business) shutdowns and border closures.""
In a sign of how the business world has swiftly been turned upside down, Air France shares are now 60% below the 9.9-euro median target price based on analysts' recommendations, mostly made before the coronavirus outbreak became a global health crisis, Refinitiv data shows. 
Of the 21 analysts who had a view on Air France, only one recommended selling the shares. 
Two-thirds of analysts covering British cinema operator Cineworld (L:CINE) rated the stock as a ""buy"" before the new virus spread across the world and the government told citizens to avoid social activities.
Cineworld shares have fallen 83% since mid-February when the virus started spreading rapidly in Europe.
'UNCHARTED TERRITORY'
It's a similar picture in energy and other sectors roiled by coronavirus panic and the oil price plunge precipitated by a dispute between top crude exporters Saudi Arabia and Russia.
Interest rate cuts, cash injections, and the prospect of government stimulus haven't prevented $21 trillion being wiped off global equities' value.
But with hundreds of companies issuing dire warnings or cancelling previously stated outlooks, it's tough for analysts to adjust target prices.
""There's very little data available to analysts,""  Barclays  (LON:BARC) equity strategist Emmanuel Cau told Reuters.
""While a lot of companies just cancel their forecast, they're actually not providing analysts with up-to-date data on how the crisis is impacting their earnings.""
Danish jeweler  Pandora  (CO:PNDORA), travel firms  Expedia  (O:EXPE) and Tui (DE:TUIGn), and chipmaker Broadcom (O:AVGO) are among those to recently withdraw 2020 financial outlooks.
As a result of analysts' lack of updated guidance, median target estimates remain light years above where shares are trading now.
Meanwhile, equity traders who closely monitor sell-side research are having to do their own groundwork before taking a call on selling, buying or holding.
""You do your own work, take your own risks and end up selling anyway,"" said Keith Temperton, a sales trader at Tavira Securities, a brokerage.
""This is uncharted territory. The nature of this crisis is unlike 2008 which was systemically rescued by the central banks.""

LONDON/SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia and Taiwan joined governments offering financial aid to airlines, while authorities in Europe rushed on Wednesday to agree steps to rescue carriers which have had to park planes and cut jobs as the coronavirus puts the brake on travel.
The scramble to bail out carriers came as Italy once again rescued Alitalia, with Rome taking control of the airline and shelving a sale process for the perennially loss-making carrier.
European Union transport ministers discussed potential help following calls from the airline sector for urgent tax relief to avoid multiple bankruptcies.
Norway's government held talks with Norwegian Air (OL:NWC) executives after the struggling airline called for financial backing similar to that given to regional counterpart SAS (ST:SAS) by Denmark and Sweden.
In the United States, airlines have asked Washington for $50 billion in grants and loans, plus tens of billions in tax relief. Sector executives are due to speak with U.S. President Donald Trump by phone on Wednesday.
Planemaker  Boeing Co  (N:BA) has called on the U.S. government to provide at least $60 billion in access to liquidity, including loan guarantees, for the aerospace manufacturing industry as airlines halt deliveries and new orders to conserve cash. 
Airbus (PA:AIR) has also signaled some government support may be needed if the coronavirus crisis lasts for several months, three people familiar with the matter said.
The Australian government said it would refund and waive charges to airlines such as domestic air traffic control fees worth A$715 million ($430 million), including A$159 million up front, as it advised citizens against all foreign travel.
Taiwan's civil aviation regulator said that its airlines could apply for subsidies and loans backdated to Jan. 15. 
CASH CRUNCH
The outbreak of the flu-like virus has wiped 41%, or $157 billion, off the share value of the world's 116 listed airlines, with many using up their cash so fast they can now cover less than two months of expenses, a Reuters analysis showed.
The International Air Transport Association (IATA) representing the sector said $200 billion in government support could be needed worldwide.
Airlines have been forced to take drastic measures to cut their costs.
Emirates and  El Al  Israel Airlines (AT:ELAL) asked staff to take unpaid leave, and  Vietnam Airlines  (HM:HVN) and Vietjet Air (HM:VJC) will suspend flights to major Southeast Asian and European destinations.
U.S. airlines are seeking to quickly reduce their workforces through unpaid leave of up to 12 months with medical benefits or early retirement packages in a sign carriers do not expect a quick rebound.
Trump said on Tuesday that travel restrictions within the United States are being considered, which would be a further blow to its domestic carriers.
PASSENGER NUMBERS PLUNGE
Global passenger numbers are expected to fall by as much as 30% this year with a full recovery not likely until 2022 or 2023, S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) Ratings said.
""At the risk of being alarmist, the airline industry is on the brink of collapse as governments are quarantining large portions of their populations and closing off borders,"" Cowen analyst Helane Becker told clients.
The situation has worsened for airlines this week as governments have tightened travel restrictions.
United Airlines Holdings Inc (O:UAL) said it would cut 60% of its capacity in April, including 85% of its international flights.
Air New Zealand Ltd (NZ:AIR) on Wednesday suspended trading in its shares for another two days to assess the financial implications of deep capacity cuts announced on Monday.
""This is going to be quite tough as we forecast the volumes that we are looking at over the next few months,"" CEO Greg Foran said in a video sent to reporters.

Investing.com -- Trading in U.S. stock was again suspended almost immediately after the opening on Wednesday, after another huge wave of selling driven by fears of a coronavirus-induced recession.
By 10 AM ET (1400 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 980 points, or 4.6% at 20,257 points, having tried and failed to break through the 20,000 psychological support level at the opening. The S&P 500 was down 3.7% and the Nasdaq Composite was down 2.9%.
The indices had risen by between 5.2% and 6.2% on Tuesday in response to outlines of a $1.2 trillion package of government stimulus measures.
Analysts at  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) said Wednesday they still expected the U.S. economy to contract by annualized 12.9% in the second quarter as the pandemic hits its expected peak.
Newswires reported New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio as calling for military assistance, saying that the number of confirmed cases in the city would top 1,000 by the end of the day. It had stood at 923 on Tuesday.
Globally, the number of confirmed cases has now topped 204,000, with some 6,500 of those in the U.S., according to Johns Hopkins data. The number of deaths globally has risen to 8,241, with the virus still accelerating in the U.S. and much of Europe.

Located in Abruzzo in central Italy, Atessa was the automaker's only functioning assembly plant in Europe after the group said on Monday it would halt production for two weeks at most of its European facilities to help to protect staff and adjust to a slump in demand..
Gianluca Ficco, of UILM metal mechanic union, said the company had informed workers' representative of its decision to close the plant.
""We know it will be closed until Sunday, due to lack of parts supplies,"" he said.
A spokesman for Fiat Chrysler (FCA) confirmed the plant was halted on Wednesday and that it was expected to restart operations on Monday. 
The Italian American automaker and the other two Detroit rivals, General Motors (N:GM) and Ford (N:F), agreed on Tuesday with the U.S. union UAW to curtail production at U.S. factories and limit the number of workers on the job at one time to prevent the spread of the coronavirus among roughly 150,000 factory employees.
Atessa was reopened with reduced production rates on Tuesday after being halted last week as the company performed deep cleaning and some reconfiguration of production lines to allow more space between workers. 
The facility is operated by Sevel, a joint venture between FCA and France's PSA-Peugeot (PA:PEUP). It usually produces about 300,000 light commercial vehicles annually and employs about 5,000 people. 
Among parts makers which have stopped supplies, Ficco quoted Germany's Isringhausen, which also operates a plant in Atessa supplying seats to Sevel.
Isringhausen's workers in Atessa are currently on strike over the implementation of anti-virus health measures at their plant. 
The FCA spokesman also confirmed the stoppage was partly due to disruptions in parts supply from local manufacturers, including Isringhausen.
Ficco said that at the reopening the Atessa plant was compliant with health requirements set by the government, but that workers were still worried about possible virus contagion.

""Like in every manufacturing plant, there is a huge fear among workers about contagion,"" he said.

1123,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 18, 2020 08:08AM ET</span>","BlackRock stands by climate priorities, sees tougher shareholder votes","By Ross Kerber and Simon Jessop
BOSTON/LONDON (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc executives who set the asset manager's influential proxy votes on Tuesday outlined tougher priorities tied to climate change and executive pay for the upcoming corporate annual meeting season. 
The comments fleshed out details about how the $7 trillion asset manager would cast its shareholder votes at a time of economic uncertainty. BlackRock Chief Executive Larry Fink laid out a more forceful approach in January after criticism from investors.
Michelle Edkins, BlackRock's (N:BLK) global head of investment stewardship, said in an interview on Tuesday that the coronavirus pandemic is consuming corporate attention but indicated that BlackRock will not cut company directors slack as it decides whether to back their re-election.
BlackRock will continue to judge whether boards have made progress against goals BlackRock has touted for several years such as those tied to climate issues, Edkins said. This year, she said, ""We're being much more direct.""
Absent progress the company expects it will vote against more directors, she said. In previous years it has supported directors about 97% of the time at Russell 3000 companies, according to Proxy Insight.
Edkins also said the pandemic could help sort out which companies have kept a long-term focus and have strong human capital management and business continuity plans.
""The concept of long-term sustainability would suggest that companies that come through this crisis and do well would be exactly the kinds of companies you would look to as role models,"" she said.
BlackRock's comments come as investors weigh what impact the coronavirus will have on efforts to slow climate change. 
Among other things, BlackRock this year will look for executive pay to correlate with long-term performance metrics such as companies' total shareholder returns over three or five years, according to a fact sheet provided by the company. 
A Reuters analysis last year found a pattern of deference to managers by BlackRock and other top index fund managers, even at poor-performing companies as measured by three-year returns through the end of 2018.
BlackRock also will ask companies to give details recommended by the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures and the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board, and threatened to vote against non-executive directors in cases where there are not adequate disclosures.[nL8N2B35L6]
BlackRock said it will explain more specific votes, such as why it opposed executive pay at chipmaker  Qualcomm Inc  (O:QCOM). BlackRock published seven such explanations in 2017, but just two the next year and one in 2019. 
Now, said BlackRock co-Chair Barbara Novick, ""We're trying to enhance the quantity and quality of communications.""

The bank said in a regulatory filing it will increase its provision for the tax probe in the fourth quarter to $259 million, in addition to $611 million it had already set aside.
For several years, U.S. authorities, including the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and the New York Department of Financial Services, have been investigating accusations that the Israeli bank helped U.S. clients evade taxes.
""Recently, the bank group and each of the DOJ and bank regulatory teams handling the investigations have extensively negotiated the terms of resolutions, which, once approved by the U.S. authorities and the bank group and finalized, would resolve the investigations,"" Hapoalim said.
The settlement would be a deferred prosecution agreement, the bank said. Its subsidiary in Switzerland will sign a plea agreement with the DOJ relating to its business with its American customers.
""The final sign off will pave the way (for) the accelerated growth of Hapoalim’s loan book, dividend resumptions and share buy-backs,""  Barclays  (LON:BARC) analyst Tavy Rosner said.
Hapoalim's main rival, Bank Leumi (TA:LUMI), in 2014 agreed to pay $400 million to settle two separate investigations into whether it helped U.S. clients evade taxes.  Mizrahi Tefahot  Bank (TA:MZTF) paid $195 million a year ago to settle a five-year U.S. tax evasion investigation.
Hapoalim also said it expects to pay $30 million in a non-prosecution agreement, which it will provision in the fourth quarter, to settle a U.S. probe into alleged corruption involving officials from world soccer's governing body, FIFA.
Hapoalim has said the U.S. probe was looking into accounts held by some of the suspects with the bank.
Shares in Hapoalim were down 2.3% in afternoon trade in Tel Aviv, compared with much steeper 5% declines in the broader market.
The bank is scheduled to report fourth-quarter results in the coming days."

Vieira Monteiro, 73, became chairman of Santander Totta in 2019 after seven years as chief executive. He led the bank during a period of austerity, economic and debt crisis in Portugal.
A Santander spokesman confirmed that Vieira Monteiro had died, but would not say if that was from the coronavirus.
Portuguese newspaper Jornal Economico said Vieira Monteiro was put in quarantine earlier this month after a trip to hard-hit Italy, and was in intensive care in a Lisbon hospital since last week.
Portugal has reported 448 confirmed cases of coronavirus, far below neighbouring Spain's 13,716.
Portugal reported its first coronavirus death on Monday and said more were expected. Health Minister Marta Temido said the first fatality was an 80-year-old man with pre-existing conditions who was hospitalised in Lisbon."
1127,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 18, 2020 07:36AM ET</span>",Global Bonds Plunge Ahead of Debt Deluge From Pandemic Defense,"(Bloomberg) --
European sovereign bonds led a global rout as markets braced for the kind of supply surge not seen for years, after nations from the U.K. to France and Italy unveiled plans to spend their way out of the coronavirus crisis.
Investors are pricing in the risk of a surge in government borrowing to fund stimulus aimed at offsetting the economic shock from the pandemic. Italian 10-year yields jumped as much as 64 basis points, while those on German 30-year debt surged back above 0%. Rates on 10-year U.S. Treasuries extended their advance after clocking up the biggest jump since 1982 on Tuesday.
Some $1.14 trillion in fiscal support has been pledged or is under consideration as governments around the world rush to contain the coronavirus and shore up financial markets and businesses. Pledges by Germany and France to guarantee hundreds of billions in bank loans boosted the global tally.
“Given the massive fiscal stimulus, rates have to go,” said Jens Peter Sorensen, chief analyst at Danske Bank A/S. “It goes for Treasuries, BTPs, bunds, Spain, France, you name it.”
While it isn’t surprising that the debt of nations deemed more vulnerable to the outbreak have taken a hit, it’s striking that bond spreads are widening when even the benchmark -- German yields -- is rising. That suggests that the prospects of fiscal expansion and more bond sales are moving markets.
“This is hard to rationalize given one would tend to think that risk aversion should operate as a zero-sum game wherein safe havens such as bunds are the beneficiaries,” Rabobank strategists including Richard McGuire wrote in a note. “Investors appear to be pricing in a sizable budgetary deterioration throughout the euro area.”

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are set to open with hefty losses Wednesday, giving back Tuesday’s gains, with investors fearful that the proposed virus stimulus package will not be sufficient to assuage severe economic damage from a protracted economic slowdown.
At 7:05 AM ET (1105 GMT), futures for the S&P 500 traded 92 points, or 3.7%, lower, futures for the Nasdaq down 330 points, or 4.5%, while the Dow Jones 30  futures contract fell 833 points, or 4%. These contracts have been stopped limit down, which suggests the cash markets could open with even greater percentage losses.
Wall Street closed with strong gains Tuesday after the Trump administration assembled a $1.2 trillion stimulus plan, that would send cash to Americans within two weeks, and backstop airlines and other companies. 
However, to get this deal past skeptical Republican senators, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin warned that the country’s unemployment rate could hit 20% if they failed to act on this rescue package and there was lasting economic damage.
More and more economists including those from Wall Street’s biggest banks have declared that the outbreak has already triggered a global recession. Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) Goldman Sachs, for example, forecast in a note Sunday that the U.S. economy will shrink 5% in the second quarter after a 0% gain in gross domestic product growth in the first three months of the year.
In corporate news, Boeing (NYSE:BA) will be in the spotlight after the aerospace manufacturer called late Tuesday for at least $60 billion in federal aid to help the industry.
Shares in Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) fell more than 5% in after-hours trading Tuesday amid suggestions that its factory in Fremont, California may only maintain ""minimum basic operations"" as law officials declared it a non-essential business in order to slow the spread of the coronavirus. 
The economic calendar looks light Wednesday, but eyes will be on the release of the official weekly crude oil inventories, at 10:30 AM ET (1430 GMT), after the American Petroleum Institute estimated on Tuesday a surprise crude oil inventory draw of 421,000 barrels for the week ending March 13.
Oil prices continued to fall Wednesday with U.S. crude futures tumbling to a 17-year low as travel and social lockdowns sparked by the coronavirus epidemic knocked the outlook for demand.
AT 07:10 AM ET (1110 GMT), U.S. crude futures traded 5.6% lower at $25.80 a barrel, having earlier fallen to $25.51, its lowest since May 2003. The international benchmark Brent contract fell 3.5% to $27.74, just off $27.57, its lowest since early 2016.

MANILA/DUBAI (Reuters) - Middle East airline Qatar Airways laid off about 200 Filipino staff in Doha this week and rival Emirates asked pilots to take unpaid leave as the coronavirus outbreak hammers demand for travel.
The state-owned airlines have had to slash dozens of flights, which are crucial for their Gulf hubs that millions of passengers pass through each year.
Philippine Labour Secretary Silvestre Bello told Reuters on Wednesday that the government was trying to ascertain the ""real cause"" behind the unexpected decision to lay off the workers.
Qatar Airways did not respond to an emailed request for comment.
The layoffs were reported earlier by ABS-CBN. It said the Filipino employees, including engineers and maintenance staff, were laid off on Tuesday and others had also lost their jobs.
State-owned Qatar Airways had warned it would report its third consecutive loss this financial year, which ends this month, before the outbreak battered global travel demand.
Dubai's Emirates has joined other airlines around world in asking pilots to take unpaid leave.
""You are strongly encouraged to make use of this opportunity to volunteer for additional paid and unpaid leave,"" the airline said in an internal email to pilots seen by Reuters.
Emirates, one of the world's biggest international airlines, did not immediately respond to an email request for comment.
Tourism and aviation are vital to Dubai's economy, which does not have the vast oil wealth of some of its neighbors.
Emirates Group, which employed over 100,000 people, including about 4,000 pilots as of March 2019, asked staff to take unpaid leave earlier this month, although pilots were not included in the request then.
Emirates has told staff the coronavirus epidemic could be the biggest challenge it has faced in many years.
The airline has frozen recruitment and continues to cut flights as the situation worsens globally.
In response to a Reuters query as to whether the Dubai government would provide support to its state aviation entities, the state media office sent a statement from the emirate's airport operator.
Dubai Airports said it was working with business partners to mitigate the impact of the coronavirus but could not comment further as commercial arrangements were confidential.
Abu Dhabi's Etihad Airways on Wednesday announced another raft of flight cancellations, including to India and Egypt."

LONDON/TOKYO (Reuters) - Global stocks stumbled back into the red on Wednesday with Wall Street futures pointing to more losses ahead as fears over the coronavirus fallout eclipsed large-scale support measures rolled out by policymakers around the globe. 
Some traditional safe-haven assets such as gold were also under pressure as battered investors looked to unwind their damaged positions.
Oil prices fell for a third session with U.S. crude futures tumbling to a 17-year low.
""Another remarkable day in what is clearly fin-de-regime,"" Rabobank's global strategist Michael Every wrote in a note.
""Things have already irrevocably changed and whipsaw market action reflects that this is the case. The only issue is how much further they change from here, and hence where markets settle.""
European equity markets suffered hefty losses with London and Frankfurt down 3.5% in early trade while Paris and Milan slipped around 3%.
The falls in Europe followed losses in Asia where MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan dropped 3.8% to lows last seen in summer 2016, led by a 6.4% fall in Australia. Japan's Nikkei erased early gains to dip 1.7%. MSCI's global stocks index dropped 1%.
Losses were set to extend to Wall Street with U.S. stock futures indicating as much as 4% lower and hitting their daily low limit just a day after the S&P 500 rose 6% and Dow Jones rose 5.2% or 1,049 points. (N)
""A rise of 1,000 points in Dow is something you see only during a financial crisis. It is not a good sign,"" said Tomoaki Shishido, senior fixed income strategist at Nomura Securities.
""A rise of 100 points would be much better for the economy.""
Big price swings have left market participants nursing losses, making them reluctant to jump back into the market and thereby reducing trading volume.
Tuesday's Wall Street gains came as policymakers cobbled together packages to counter the impact of the virus. 
The Trump administration unveiled a $1 trillion stimulus package that could deliver $1,000 cheques to Americans within two weeks to buttress a virus-stricken economy.
Britain launched a 330 billion pounds ($400 billion) rescue package for businesses threatened with collapse while France, which went into lockdown on Tuesday, is to pump 45 billion euros ($50 billion) of crisis measures into its economy to help companies and workers.
Still, forecasters at banks are projecting a steep economic contraction in at least the second quarter as governments take draconian measures to combat the virus, shutting restaurants, closing schools and calling on people to stay home.
Tuesday saw also the U.S. Federal Reserve step in again to ease funding stress among corporates by reopening its Commercial Paper Funding Facility to underwrite short-term corporate loans.
""While markets react to positive news on stimulus, that doesn't last long. I think there are a lot of banks and investors whose balance sheet was badly hit and they still have lots of positions to sell,"" said Shin-ichiro Kadota, senior currency and rates strategist at  Barclays  (LON:BARC).

Investing.com -- We're at that point in the movie where the heroine is still tied to the railroad tracks, the train is fast approaching and the hero is still struggling to get there in time. 
Europe’s stock markets tanked again on Wednesday amid fears that increasingly extravagant government support measures ($1.2 trillion from the U.S., $400 billion from the U.K., $220 billion from Spain announced in the space of the last 24 hours) still aren’t keeping pace with the spread of the Covid-19 virus.
Evidence of the near-total shutdown of non-essential work continued to flood out Wednesday, with German automaker BMW suspending car production for four weeks across Europe and predicting a sharp drop in profits this year. BMW (DE:BMWG) stock fell 8.1%.
Airbus (PA:AIR) stock tumbled again, falling 13% amid fears that its biggest clients will end up bankrupt before they can take delivery of all the planes they’ve ordered in recent years. Suppliers  Safran  (PA:SAF) and  Meggitt  (LON:MGGT) also fell sharply.
HSBC, Europe’s largest bank, decided that this was no time to be without a permanent chief executive officer, and confirmed Noel Quinn in the position. Quinn has been implementing ever-more radical restructuring plans as interim CEO since John Flint was pushed out last year.
Meanwhile,  Barclays  (LON:BARC) warned that it was “very, very unlikely” to hit this year’s profit target pushing its shares down by 3.6%, somewhat oddly given that the news can hardly have been unexpected. HSBC (LON:HSBA) shares fell 3.7%.
Elsewhere in the banking sector, Germany’s regulators said they would release banks’ counter-cyclical capital buffer, following similar action from the Bank of England last week.
 Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) shares bounced 0.6% but Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) shares fell another 2.5% to a new all-time low, as markets priced in a growing likelihood that the state, which still owns 18% of the bank after bailing it out in the last crisis, will have to pump in more funds to support it.
The promise of government support has, however, had a positive effect on some retailers. Marks and Spencer (LON:MKS) and  Kingfisher  (LON:KGF) rose 11.7% and 7.1% respectively after the U.K. government promised retailers a 12-month holiday on business rates.  Supermarket chains J  Sainsbury  PLC (LON:SBRY) and WM Morrison (LON:MRW) also bounced smartly on the same news.
However, government support only goes so far.  Inditex  (MC:ITX) – the owner of Zara, Pull & Bear and Massimo Dutti – fell to a new seven-year low after booking a 287 million euro charge to absorb Covid-19 impacts. The company has closed thousands of stores worldwide, including all of its stores in home market Spain, in response to government health measures. Inditex stock fell as much as 12% before recovering to be down only 3.7% by 5:35 AM ET (0935 GMT).
The big winners of the day were in telecoms, with all the big players profited not only from the reliability of their cash flows, but also from the confidence that their heavy debt burdens will be largely underwritten governments even through a sharp recession. BT Group (LON:BT) shares rose 5.4%, while  Telecom Italia  (MI:TLIT) rose 4.9% and Orange (PA:ORAN) rose 4.5%."

Airbus said on Tuesday it would close factories and assembly lines for four days in France and Spain, two of its core home countries alongside Britain and Germany.
The move is designed to adapt working arrangements to keep in line with recently strengthened rules on keeping a safe distance between people to slow the spread of coronavirus.
But unions officials said it would be unsafe to keep working in factories where operating in small teams in compact spaces inside aircraft fuselages is the norm.
The CGT union in Toulouse described the plan to resume operations on March 23 as an ""irresponsible attitude"".
""Airbus management must assume its responsibilities to guarantee the protection of not only employees, but the population around the company's industrial sites,"" it said.
Airbus said it continues to study its working environments in response to the latest French government measures announced on Monday and had no further updates to earlier statements.
Airbus assembles some narrow-body and all wide-body passenger jets in Toulouse, France, and the bulk of the remaining narrow-body aircraft including the hot-selling A321neo in Hamburg, Germany. Other French plants provide vital parts.
Industry sources say the Hamburg assembly operations can keep running for a matter of days without parts like cockpits and center wingboxes coming from France or other components from Spain, but a prolonged shutdown in France and Spain would cripple assembly activities worldwide.
Airbus assembles a smaller number of narrow-body jets in China and the United States. For now the Airbus plant in Mobile, Alabama, continues to assemble aircraft at its normal rate of six a month with plans to reach seven at the start of 2021.
Its Tianjin plants near Beijing recently resumed operation after a broad industrial shutdown in China linked to the initial stages of the coronavirus Covid-19 epidemic that is now affecting airline demand and industrial logistics globally."

Investing.com - European stock markets pushed sharply lower Wednesday amid concerns various policy moves by governments and central banks will not be enough to stop the coronavirus pandemic causing a severe recession.
At 04:00 ET (0900 GMT), the U.K.'s FTSE index was trading 4.5%, lower, France's CAC 40 was down 3.6%, while the DAX was down 4.4%. The pan-eurozone Euro Stoxx 50, dropped 3.9%. 
Earlier Wednesday Austrian central-bank governor Robert Holzmann, in an interview with the  daily newspaper Der Standard, said the ECB’s Governing Council has reached its limits in methods to stimulate the economy, stating that addressing the coronavirus crisis is “above all” a task for fiscal policy.
The European Central Bank was quick to issue a rare statement rebuffing these remarks, but Holzmann’s comments played into a narrative - fueled by ECB President Christine Lagarde herself last week - that central banks are struggling to cope with the fallout from the virus. 
Late Tuesday the Trump administration announced it was putting together a $1.2 trillion stimulus package to tackle the outbreak, including first signs of so-called 'helicopter money' distributed directly to households.
The U.K. followed by unveiling a 330 billion-pound ($400 billion) rescue package for businesses while Spain joined France in announcing emergency credit facilities on a similar scale, along with other measures. 
However, the relief created by these policies has been short-lived as they are measured against the sheer scale of the economic damage likely. National and local governments across the U.S. and Europe are taking draconian measures to combat the virus, shutting restaurants, closing schools and calling on people to stay home.  
In corporate news, shares in  Barclays  (LON:BARC) dropped 3.5% after the U.K. bank said it was “very, very unlikely” to meet its goal of a 10% return on equity this year given the impact on its business of the coronavirus pandemic.
Spanish fashion giant  Inditex  (MC:ITX), meanwhile, suspended its dividend in an effort to conserve cash, while German carmaker BMW (DE:BMWG) forecast a sharp drop in profits this year.
Economic data Wednesday is set to center around the release of the euro zone’s consumer price inflation figure for February, at 06:00 AM ET (1000 GMT). The annual number is expected to be unchanged at 1.2%, still well off the European Central Bank’s target of close to 2%. 
Oil markets have continued to sell off, slumping to levels not seen since 2003, crushed between the destruction of demand brought upon by the coronavirus pandemic and the glut of supply as two of the globe’s largest producers, Saudi Arabia and Russia, indulge in a price war aimed at winning back market share from U.S. producers.
AT 05:00 AM ET (0900 GMT), U.S. crude futures traded 3.0% lower at $26.51 a barrel, having fallen as low as $26.28, which would be the lowest settlement price since May 2003. The international benchmark Brent contract fell 1.5% to $28.30. 
Additionally, gold futures fell 1.9% to $1,496.20/oz, while EUR/USD traded at 1.0961, down 0.3% on the day.

Profits will be hit by a buildup of bad loan provisions as corporate borrowers suffer in the economic slowdown accompanying the virus's spread, Morzaria told a financial conference in London.

Investing.com - European stock markets are set to open sharply lower Wednesday, despite hefty gains on Wall Street overnight, as worries about the economic damage caused by the coronavirus pandemic hold sway over hopes that government policy moves will limit the fallout. 
At 03:20 ET (0720 GMT), the DAX futures contract traded 331 points, or 3.8% lower. {{167|France's CAC 40 futures were down 180 points, or 4.5%, while the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. fell 253 points, or 4.8%. Futures on the pan-eurozone index, the Euro Stoxx 50, dropped 91 points, or 3.8%. 
News that the Trump administration was putting together a $1 trillion stimulus package to tackle the outbreak helped Wall Street rebound on Tuesday, with the Dow jumping 5.2%, or about 1,049 points, the S&P 500 gaining 6% and the Nasdaq Composite added 6.2%.
This followed the U.K.unveiling a 330 billion-pound ($400 billion) rescue package for businesses while Spain joined France in announcing emergency credit facilities on a similar scale, along with other measures. 
However, the relief created by these policies has been short-lived as they are measured against the sheer scale of the economic damage likely. National and local governments across the U.S. and Europe are taking draconian measures to combat the virus, shutting restaurants, closing schools and calling on people to stay home.
The European Union agreed late Tuesday to close the bloc's external borders for 30 days in a coordinated effort to contain the outbreak.  
Economic data Wednesday is set to center around the release of the euro zone’s consumer price inflation figure for February, at 06:00 AM ET (1000 GMT). The annual number is expected to be unchanged at 1.2%, still well off the European Central Bank’s target of close to 2%. 
Oil markets have continued to sell off, slumping to levels not seen since 2003, crushed between the destruction of demand brought upon by the coronavirus pandemic and the glut of supply as two of the globe’s largest producers, Saudi Arabia and Russia, indulge in a price war aimed at winning back market share from U.S. producers.
AT 03:2AM ET (0720 GMT), U.S. crude futures traded 1.9% lower at $26.82 a barrel, having fallen as low as $26.63, which would be the lowest settlement price since May 2003. The international benchmark Brent contract fell 1.5% to $28.30. 
Additionally, gold futures fell 0.9% to $1,512.90/oz, while EUR/USD traded at 1.1002, up 0.1% on the day.

Investing.com - Softbank Group Corp. (T:9984) said it could withdraw from an agreement to buy $3 billion of stocks in WeWork, Bloomberg reported on Wednesday citing a message to stockholders of the embattled co-working business. 
 
The deal, which was originally part of a rescue financing from SoftBank after WeWork’s failed IPO in 2019, was set to close in about two weeks.
 
So far, SoftBank has already invested $1.5 billion in WeWork. Bloomberg said today’s news could create uncertainties about whether the Japanese conglomerate is seeking to negotiate a lower price or delay the purchase. 
 
The news sent shares of SoftBank down 10.4% to JPY 3,266 by 2:05 AM ET (06:05 GMT) today. 
 
The company announced last week a $4.8 billion share buyback, a move S&P Global Ratings said ""raises questions over its commitment to financial management"" and prompted a revision in its outlook for the company to negative.
 
""We believe SoftBank's aggressiveness in pursuing growth and managing its finances makes its financial standing weak,"" S&P said.

TOKYO (Reuters) - SoftBank Group Corp (T:9984) shares fell as much as 11.6% on Wednesday, with its market capitalization dipping below the value of its domestic telco, as uncertainty grows over its management of a portfolio of unproven startups.
The tech conglomerate's market cap fell to a low of 6.84 trillion yen ($64 billion), below SoftBank Corp's (T:9434) 7.1 trillion yen, reflecting the depth of investor scepticism over Chief Executive Masayoshi Son's assertions his tech bets are back on track and as the coronavirus outbreak roils markets.
Concern was exacerbated with sources telling Reuters that SoftBank is considering pulling out of a $3 billion bid to buy additional shares in its biggest soured bet, office-sharing firm WeWork, in what would be a major U-turn after it was forced to bail out the startup.
Last week, SoftBank announced a $4.8 billion share buyback amid fragile markets, a move S&P Global Ratings said ""raises questions over its commitment to financial management"" and prompted a revision in its outlook for the company to negative.
""We believe SoftBank's aggressiveness in pursuing growth and managing its finances makes its financial standing weak,"" S&P said.
Unlike peers such as Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203) and Uniqlo parent Fast Retailing Co (T:9983), SoftBank's Son has spent much of his cash pile investing in overseas startups, many of which analysts believe are exposed to a looming slowdown.
""We think no other company in Japan is as indebted and as exposed to the economic downturn as SoftBank,"" Amir Anvarzadeh, market strategist at Asymmetric Advisors, wrote in a note.
SoftBank last month said it would pledge shares in its domestic telco as collateral to raise up to $4.5 billion, reflecting its falling back on established portfolio businesses for cash as its $100 billion Vision Fund struggles to raise capital for a successor fund.
""For the next few months, cash is going to be the single most important factor as only cash will allow affected businesses to survive the very sharp (but temporary) decline in their revenues,"" tech analyst Richard Windsor wrote in a note."

CHICAGO (Reuters) - U.S. airlines are seeking to quickly reduce their workforces through early retirement packages or unpaid leave of up to 12 months with medical benefits in an effort to cut costs as the rapid spread of the coronavirus keeps people from flying.
Moves by American Airline Group Inc (O:AAL) and Delta Air Lines Inc (N:DAL), first reported by Reuters, were a further sign that airlines do not expect a quick rebound to depressed travel demand and must save costs.
""Based on the decline in air travel, we need to quickly line up our staffing levels with the reduced flying schedule,"" American said in a message to flight attendants seen by Reuters. The carrier said ""it's likely to take a long time for the airline industry to bounce back."" 
American has more than 86,000 unionized mainline employees, including about 25,300 flight attendants and 13,800 pilots.
Under a deal offered to workers on Tuesday, flight attendants, mechanics and gate agents can opt for a period of six, nine or 12 months of unpaid leave while keeping medical benefits and travel privileges. They can also take early retirement with two years of medical benefits, but no pay.
Pilots have reached a separate, more attractive deal with the company that would allow early retirement for ages 62 to 65 at half pay and medical benefits. The mandatory retirement age for U.S. airline pilots is 65.
American has not offered any leave or early retirement options to ticket reservation employees, who are in high demand as customers rush to cancel or rebook tickets. 
Meanwhile, more than 5,000 Delta flight attendants have taken a voluntary unpaid leave option starting in April after the company extended a deadline for requests, according to two Delta employees, who declined to be named because they are not authorized to speak to the media.
The people said the reasons for taking unpaid leave varied from a sense of solidarity among flight attendants who may have other family income, to family care needs as schools close or the emotional toll of being potentially exposed to the virus.
Delta has extended unpaid leave options through July, according to a memo seen by Reuters. It is also paying flight attendants' medical premiums while on leave, but the cost will be deducted from their paychecks when they return to work, the employees said.
Delta declined to comment.
The take-up for April represents around 1/5 of Delta's 25,000 flight attendants, but still means the company would have more employees than it needs to serve a drastically reduced April flying schedule.
Delta said on Saturday it had reached an agreement with its pilots union to manage overstaffing in April with partially paid schedules and coronavirus-related sick leave.
The Association of Flight Attendants-CWA, which represents 50,000 flight attendants at 20 airlines, including United Airlines (O:UAL), said it was continuing to work on different plans at each of the companies it represents ""in case things get worse.""
Airlines for America - the trade group representing American, Delta, United, Southwest Airlines Co (N:LUV) and others - is seeking a federal aid package, including $25 billion in grants and $25 billion in loans, they say is needed to survive an unprecedented downturn in demand.

They also seek tax relief that could be worth tens of billions of dollars through the end of at least 2021.

1143,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 17, 2020 09:07PM ET</span>",Exxon pays more to borrow amid market turmoil,"By Joshua Franklin
(Reuters) -  Exxon Mobil  Corp (N:XOM) paid a big premium to raise $8.5 billion in new debt on Tuesday, as a rout in energy prices and stock market jitters fueled by the coronavirus outbreak eroded investor confidence in the largest U.S. oil producer.
Exxon was among nine major companies that took advantage of a window opening in the U.S. credit markets on Tuesday to issue bonds, after the Federal Reserve announced new measures to boost liquidity in the financial system, including the purchase of short-term corporate debt.
Exxon, which is rated Aaa/AA by credit rating agencies, issued its debt at a 60 basis point premium to PepsiCo Inc (O:PEP), which has a lower investment-grade rating of A1/A+.
""Exxon had to pay a huge premium to where the bonds should have been, because they are in an industry that is viewed very negatively right now,"" said Andrew Brenner, head of international fixed income at NatAlliance Securities.
Saudi Arabia is locked in an oil price war with Russia following the collapse earlier this month of an output deal between OPEC and its allies that has wiped 30% off energy prices.
Compounding Exxon's woes is the coronavirus pandemic, which has infected more than 196,000 people around the world and killed more than 7,800, and caused severe business and travel disruptions across the globe, fueling fears of an economic downturn.
On Monday, Exxon said it would make ""significant"" cuts to spending in the face of the unprecedented slide. The company just two weeks ago had pledged to ""lean in"" to the market drop and maintain outlays in a belief oil demand would rise in the long run.
Despite the higher cost of the new debt, Exxon will be relieved to have been able to raise the funds, according to Bill Zox, chief investment officer of fixed income at Diamond Hill Capital Management
""In an environment like this, it's all about access to capital, not cost of capital,"" Zox said.
Exxon did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The company's debt pile totaled $46.9 billion as of the end of December.
A host of investment-grade companies had been deliberating on a day-by-day basis when to issue bonds and were waiting for supportive markets.
After days of no or limited issuance, the nine companies, which also included U.S. wireless carrier  Verizon Communications  Inc (N:VZ), Bank of America Corp (N:BAC) and Progressive Corp (N:PGR), took advantage of improved investor sentiment to raise a combined $25 billion, according to Refinitiv IFR data."
1144,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 17, 2020 09:05PM ET</span>",SoftBank lays ground to abandon $3 billion WeWork tender offer: sources,"By Greg Roumeliotis, Jessica DiNapoli and Joshua Franklin
(Reuters) - SoftBank Group Corp (T:9984) is considering pulling out of a $3 billion bid to buy additional shares in WeWork, because it feels the office-space sharing firm has not met the conditions for the deal, people familiar with the matter said on Tuesday.
SoftBank's U-turn would be the latest blow for WeWork's investors, which last year saw the company's valuation plummet by tens of billions of dollars amid a failed attempt to go public and a cash crunch that threatened it with bankruptcy.
SoftBank declined to comment and WeWork did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the potential withdrawal of the tender offer, which was reported earlier by the Wall Street Journal. 
SoftBank in October agreed to buy up to $3 billion WeWork shares from existing investors through a tender offer, as part of a broader bailout worth almost $10 billion.
The financing of WeWork has already been completed, and SoftBank has installed Sandeep Mathrani, former chief executive of Brookfield Properties' retail group, as its new CEO. 
In a notice to WeWork shareholders, SoftBank cited ongoing investigations into WeWork's business by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the U.S. Department of Justice, as well as a delay in recapitalizing WeWork's joint venture in China, as obstacles to the tender offer being completed, the sources said.
Under the terms of the deal, SoftBank is to exchange its stake in the joint venture with shares in WeWork. Some investors in the joint venture have yet to consent to the deal, though the WeWork board directors who negotiated it believe SoftBank can do more to complete it, according to one of the sources.
WeWork co-founder Adam Neumann, who attracted criticism for his management of the company as CEO before being ousted in September, had negotiated the right to sell $970 million of his shares as part of the tender program. 
The tender offer for the shares expires April 1, and SoftBank could let it lapse or extend it, the sources said. 
It was not immediately clear whether concerns over the impact of the coronavirus outbreak on WeWork's business have made SoftBank reluctant to proceed with the tender offer.

SoftBank became WeWork's majority owner and Neumann gave up voting control over as a result of their deal in October, and it was also not clear if this would remain the case should the tender offer collapse.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) will only receive vital supplies at its U.S. and UK and other European warehouses until April 5, its latest move to free up inventory space for medical and household goods in high demand as a result of the coronavirus outbreak.
The change does not mean Amazon will stop selling non-essential items like phone cases and toys for now, only that products may be more likely to run out of stock in the next few weeks or that sellers have to ship directly to consumers.
The move reflects how the global spread of the virus has created challenges for retailers, from supply chain to delivery.
In a note sent to sellers on Tuesday, Amazon said it is seeing increasing online shopping demand. As its household staples and medical supplies are running out of stock, it will prioritize certain categories in order to ""quickly receive, restock, and ship these products to customers.""
Amazon defined several categories as essential products that can continue shipping, including baby products; health and household items; beauty and personal care; grocery; industrial and scientific; and pet supplies. Books are included as well.
""We understand this is a change for our selling partners and appreciate their understanding as we temporarily prioritize these products for customers,"" Amazon said in a statement.
The company said the new protocol applies to its retail inventory as well as to the products of third-party sellers on its platform.
The move follows Amazon's Monday announcement that it will hire 100,000 more workers, as the world's largest online retailer is trying to meet growing online shopping need from people who stay home amid the coronavirus outbreak.
LESS AD REVENUE?
The news may hurt demand for lucrative services that Amazon offers to merchants, like advertising.
Amy Roskelley, owner of Utah-based Health Beet, said she pays Amazon around $1,000 a month to promote her flatware products that help consumers portion their meals. Now that she can’t add inventory to Amazon’s warehouses, she plans to cut ad spend in half.
“It’s hard for me to justify spending money if I don’t have enough inventory to fill” customers’ orders, she said.
Roskelley is considering other ways to reduce her dependence on Amazon, too, whether shipping directly to customers or driving traffic to her own website.
""I have been concerned that they'll shut down Amazon’s warehouses and won’t ship out at all, and that would just devastate me,"" she said.
Amazon has yet to indicate any such closures. Still, the months-long outbreak is posing challenges to the Seattle e-commerce company's operations.
Merchant Zengxie Pang said Amazon's change came just as the China-based seller's factories had resumed production.
""Now we can't ship to warehouses until April,"" Pang said. ""We are already seeing a rising demand for kitchen supplies, and they will likely run out of stock.""
Chief executive of personal massager company LuLu, Michael Gawrychowski, said his supplier in China woke him in the middle of the night with news of Amazon's change.
""People are freaking out,"" he said. Gawrychowski immediately sent a request for a 25,000-unit shipment. That was rejected, but a second request went through, he said.
Amazon's two-day shipping guarantee has in some cases slowed to up to seven-day delivery, Baird Equity Research analyst Colin Sebastian said in a note. Tuesday's announcement aims to speed up the operation, at the risk of limiting the availability of non-essential items like electronics that typically are a big part of Amazon's business.
""This change will likely force some third-party sellers currently dependent on Amazon to shift sales to other marketplaces (eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY), Wish, Walmart (NYSE:WMT), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) Marketplace, etc.), or onto their own websites,"" Sebastian said.
Customer searches for popular items including iPhone cases, AirPods and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Watch bands have fallen from the week prior, an indication of shifting shopper interests, according to research from Helium 10, which provides tools to sellers.
Workers at bars, gyms, theaters and other non-essential businesses have been furloughed to help contain the spread of the deadly virus, and President Donald Trump on Monday said the U.S. economy may be sliding into recession.
For sellers, which account for over half of sales on Amazon, the new warehouse policy only adds to the economic uncertainty they are facing, said Chris McCabe, founder of Amazon seller consultancy ecommerceChris.com.
""Sellers are rethinking their entire strategies for selling in 2020,"" he said."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co on Tuesday called for a $60 billion lifeline for the struggling U.S. aerospace manufacturing industry, which faces huge losses from the coronavirus pandemic.
Reuters first reported that Boeing was seeking ""tens of billions of dollars"" in U.S. government loan guarantees and other assistance as faces it a looming liquidity crunch due to the coronavirus' impact on the aviation sector, two people briefed on the matter told Reuters.
Boeing spokesman Gordon Johndroe subsequently said the company ""supports a minimum of $60 billion in access to public and private liquidity, including loan guarantees, for the aerospace manufacturing industry.""
Boeing declined to say how much of that would be for the planemaker versus loan guarantees for its suppliers; it was also unclear if U.S. banks would loan any of the more than $60 billion without government backing.
The U.S. planemaker has told lawmakers it needs significant government support to meet liquidity needs and it cannot raise that in current market conditions, the people said.
Boeing confirmed Monday it was in talks with the administration about short-term support, while U.S. President Donald Trump said Tuesday the U.S. government would provide support. Boeing has noted that typically 70% of its revenue flows to its 17,000 suppliers and has told lawmakers that without significant assistance the entire U.S. aviation manufacturing sector could collapse.
""This will be one of the most important ways for airlines, airports, suppliers and manufacturers to bridge to recovery. Funds would support the health of the broader aviation industry, because much of any liquidity support to Boeing will be used for payments to suppliers to maintain the health of the supply chain,"" Johndroe said.
The amount of aid Boeing needs remains in flux based on market conditions and how long the crisis lasts. Congressional officials are reviewing Boeing's cash needs as Congress considers a stimulus and rescue package that could top $1 trillion.
""Boeing got hit hard in many different ways,"" Trump said at a press conference Tuesday. He said he would also help suppliers like engine maker  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Co. ""We have to protect Boeing... We'll be helping Boeing.""
Boeing's stock has been plummeting. After falling 24% on Monday, it fell another 4.4% Tuesday to close at $123.92. Boeing is down more than 60% over the last month as the coronavirus pandemic slashed travel demand worldwide. S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) downgraded Boeing's credit rating on Monday and lowered its free cash flow expectations for the company.
Boeing has been struggling to win approval from regulators for its 737 MAX to return to service after two fatal crashes in five months. The plane has been grounded since March 2019.
U.S. airlines and cargo carriers have said they are seeking at least $58 billion in loans and grants along with additional tax changes, while airports have sought $10 billion.
Boeing confirmed on Tuesday that it had completed the drawdown of the rest of a $13.8 billion line of credit it had secured last month.
Boeing’s total debt nearly doubled to $27.3 billion in 2019, as it compensated airlines and grappled with additional production costs for the 737 MAX even as the grounding prevented it from delivering the aircraft to buyers.
Reuters on Tuesday reported Airbus has about 16 billion euros ($17.60 billion) in cash and needs some 5.5 billion euros a month, a person familiar with Monday’s discussions said.
Industry sources said that even before the coronavirus crisis squeezed its finances, Boeing had been providing financial support to a number of suppliers to help them ride out the shutdown of 737 MAX production as well as paying airlines compensation for the delay in delivering MAX planes.

The focus on design problems as a key factor leading up to two fatal crashes that led to the grounding has left the planemaker exposed to potential shareholder lawsuits from partners and airlines at risk from the MAX shutdown.

SAN FRANCISCO/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - American hotel and travel industry executives from companies such as Marriott and Hilton met with U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday to discuss a potential $250 billion aid package, as thousands of hotel workers began furloughs due to the fast-spreading coronavirus.
The requested package would consist of $150 billion in direct aid for the hotel sector and $100 billion for related travel companies, including convention businesses, industry executives said on a call after the meeting with Trump, who made his fortune in real estate and hotels.
Separately, the airline industry has asked for $58 billion in assistance for both passenger and cargo carriers, plus $10 billion for airports.
The hotel industry said it was expecting to lose $1.4 billion in revenue every week on account of the virus, according to statements from the American Hotel and Lodging Association and the U.S. Travel Association, which also forecasts a 30% drop in hotel occupancy over a year.
The sudden cratering of demand would cause the loss of 4.6 million jobs, the statements added. 
Chip Rogers, chief executive of the American Hotels and Lodging Association, said the economic impact of the pandemic on the hotel industry was already bigger than ""September 11th and the 2008 recession combined.""
""Thirty-three thousand small business hotels across the country are facing the difficult decision right now whether to close their doors and lay off millions of people over the next few days,"" he said on the call with reporters after the Trump meeting.
The groups said they asked the White House to take ""immediate action"" including a stabilization fund to keep people employed and access to liquidity for hotel businesses in the form of low interest loans.
They also asked for modifications to loan programs to help keep small hotel owners afloat and direct grants.
Roger Dow, chief executive of the U.S. Travel Association, said ""it will take at least $100 billion to cover wages for two quarters, and then you take the rest of the industry, we're talking $150 billion.""
Marriott, the largest hotel company, confirmed Tuesday it was beginning to furlough what it anticipates will be tens of thousands of employees.
A company spokesman said it had begun shutting down some of its managed properties last week, and was also cutting staffing at hotels that are still open. Workers are not being paid but will get healthcare benefits, the company added.
At a press availability during the meeting, which also included Vice President Mike Pence, Hilton's chief executive said occupancy was down to 15% and hotels in some cities were shutting down.
A spokesman said Hilton had temporarily suspended new reservations at two hotels in New York and Washington, D.C., although it was allowing current guests to continue their stays.
Hyatt's chief executive, also speaking during the meeting, said occupancy at his company's hotels was in the single digits.
Before their session at the White House industry executives also spoke with multiple members of Congress, including Senators Susan Collins and Cory Gardner.
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told reporters he hoped Congress would provide aid to the hotel industry including potential loan guarantees.
Airlines have also been battling to survive a plunge in demand amid travel restrictions and recommendations to self-isolate.
Sabre, whose technology is used for airline reservations, said on Tuesday it would suspend paying dividends and repurchasing shares due to the virus. Moody's also downgraded Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) Co's debt ratings to Baa1.
Democrats in Congress are expected to assist the sector, but have said any bailout should come with conditions like protections for workers and requirements for consumer-friendly and environmentally sound business practices.

A spokesman for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said she spoke with U.S. airline CEOs on Tuesday, at their request. There was agreement on the need for ""big, immediate action,"" he said, as well as assistance that ""puts workers' paychecks and benefits first.""

1149,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 17, 2020 06:58PM ET</span>",U.S. Treasury approves revival of Fed primary dealer backstop,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Tuesday said he approved the creation of a new primary dealer credit facility to ease credit market disruptions caused by the coronavirus epidemic, resurrecting the second 2008 financial crisis-era backstop in less than a day.
The facility, managed by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, will offer loans up to 90 days to the two dozen Wall Street primary dealers who are important conduits for the sale of a broad range of bonds and other financial assets.
Mnuchin said the primary dealer credit facility would be in place for at least six months and may be extended as conditions warrant. Earlier on Tuesday, Mnuchin approved a Fed backstop for the $1 trillion commercial paper market, using $10 billion from the Treasury's Exchange Stabilization Fund"
1150,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 17, 2020 06:42PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch for March 18,"By Kim Khan 
Investing.com - The U.S. stock market managed to bounce back today, with the S&P 500 rising 6% and the CBOE Volatility Index falling 8% and retreating from record territory.
Wall Street was all about “what have you done for me, lately?” and the Trump administration and the Federal Reserve gave them enough to go on, with commitment to a stimulus package that could be more than $1 trillion, including checks in the mail, and the Fed stepping in to unfreeze the commercial paper market.
Wednesday looks to be more than same as far as overall sentiment hinging on more details of government action.
Here are three things that could move the markets.
1. Market Still Thirsty for Details
Equity investors will be looking for more concrete details and action regarding federal government help for the economy.
The initial Covid-19 response bill of the House still has to be approved by the Senate, although Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says the upper chamber will pass it without changes.
And there are more details on the second package floated by Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, such as how much would come in the form of checks sent directly to taxpayers and when (Mnuchin said in two weeks but reports said late April more likely).
Among sectors to watch will be airlines, which have asked for $50 billion, and travel and hospitality stocks, which could also get help in the package.
In addition, Boeing (NYSE:BA), which has been a serious drag on the Dow, wants tens of billions of dollars in guaranteed loans to meet liquidity needs, Reuters reported. President Donald Trump said he “absolutely” wants to help Boeing.
And retailers will also be in focus to see what actions they are taking. Macy’s (NYSE:M) said it is temporarily closing stores, as will Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN).
2. Housing Starts Arrive as Housing Stocks Hammered
Housing numbers arrive tomorrow, important for a sector that’s been battered not just on the prospects of a U.S. recession, but of a new landscape where potential buyers could be unable to view properties for months.
KB Home (NYSE:KBH) is down 65% in the last month, while DR Horton (NYSE:DHI) and  Lennar  (NYSE:LEN) are have fallen about 50%.
The Commerce Department will report on groundbreaking of new homes at 8:30 AM ET (12:30 GMT).
February housing starts are expected to fall to an annual rate of 1.5 million, according to economists’ forecasts compiled by Investing.com.
Building permits are also seen falling to a rate of 1.5 million for the month.
The housing sector is also on the radar of the government, with the Trump administration considering allowing homeowners to delay mortgage payments.
3. Oil Inventories on Tap
U.S. oil inventories arrive tomorrow at a time when oil traders are also grappling with an unprecedented situation.
Saudi Arabia is dumping millions of barrels of crude on the market at a time when demand is cratering.
The Energy Information Administration will report the latest weekly crude stockpiles numbers at 10:30 AM ET (14:30 GMT).Crude inventories are expected to have risen by about 3.26 million barrels for the week ended March 13, according to forecasts compiled by Investing.com."

The Primary Dealer Credit Facility “will offer overnight and term funding with maturities up to 90 days and will be available on March 20, 2020,” the central bank said in a statement.
The facility will run for at least six months, the statement said, and may be extended.

1152,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 17, 2020 06:24PM ET</span>",Democrats agree on 'big immediate action' to back U.S. airline industry,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told the CEOs of U.S. airlines on Tuesday that Democrats agree on the need for ""big immediate action"" to boost the sagging U.S. aviation industry but have not reached agreement on what a bailout would look like.
Airlines are seeking $50 billion in grants and loans in the face of the massive travel slowdown caused by the coronavirus pandemic.
A spokesman for Pelosi said she told the chief executives that ""there was agreement on the crucial contribution aviation workers provide to the nation’s economy; the need for big, immediate action; and that assistance must put workers’ paychecks and benefits first.""
Airlines for America, which represents American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL), United Airlines Inc, Delta Air Lines Inc (NYSE:DAL), Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) Co and others, said in order for the industry to survive it needs $25 billion in grants, $25 billion in loans and significant tax relief, including the return of at least $4 billion in taxes paid this year.
It warned that without action, airlines could run out of money by year-end - and even sooner if credit card companies withhold payments.
But congressional aides say they will likely demand significant conditions as part of any bailout and its form is still uncertain.
Senate Democratic Leader Charles Schumer wants to prohibit stock buybacks as part of any airline assistance, and suggested that employees should be added to airlines boards and pay raises for executives be prohibited.
""Last time, the government took stock when they gave money to the banks. Well maybe that stock should go to the employees so they have some representation in these industries,"" Schumer said. ""It has to put workers first.""
Pelosi and some other Democrats insist that any bailout must prioritize workers. Others want airlines to adopt consumer-friendly or environmentally sound business practices as a condition of a bailout.
Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said on Twitter that ""96% of airline profits over the last decade went to buying up their own stocks to juice the price - not raising wages or other investments. If there is so much as a DIME of corporate bailout money in the next relief package, it should include a reinstated ban on stock buybacks.""
Four Democratic senators said in a letter on Tuesday that Congress made mistakes when assistance it offered after the September 2001 attacks did not provide sufficient protections for employees.
Senators Ed Markey, Sheldon Whitehouse, Tammy Baldwin and Richard Blumenthal said Congress ""cannot permit the airline industry to obtain federal assistance to weather the coronavirus and then return to these predatory business practices after the crisis.""
United Chief Executive Oscar Munoz and union leaders at the airline said in a letter to U.S. officials on Monday the ""financial support that you provide would allow United to continue paying our employees as we weather this crisis – protecting tens of thousands of people from imposing a temporary furlough.""

Airlines are also seeking $8 billion for cargo carriers, equally divided in grants and loans. Airports are seeking at least $10 billion in assistance, sources told Reuters on Monday.

1154,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 17, 2020 05:24PM ET</span>",Wall Street gives thumbs down to potential shortened trading day,"By Noel Randewich and April Joyner
(Reuters) - U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin's suggestion on Tuesday that the country's stock exchanges might shorten their trading hours did not go over well with investors reeling from Wall Street's recent plunge sparked by growing fears about the coronavirus.
At a news conference, Mnuchin said the Trump administration intends to keep markets open but said shortened trading hours may be needed at some point. He did not explain the conditions that could prompt the move.
In response, CME Group (O:CME) Chairman and Chief Executive Terry Duffy issued a statement objecting to any move to shorten the trading session due to high volatility. CME Group operates the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the world's largest derivatives bourse.
Intercontinental Exchange Inc (N:ICE), which operates the New York Stock Exchange, said in a statement that its platforms were operating normally and that it was prepared to switch to all-electronic trading if necessary.
""Shorter hours make no sense,"" CME's Duffy wrote. ""Markets are global, so shortening U.S. hours would not decrease volatility. Rather, it could actually increase as investors turn to other venues outside the U.S. when developments occur."" 
Portfolio managers and traders cited potential problems in cutting trading hours, such as increasing the burden on electronic trading infrastructure and hurting the market's credibility, especially if it is perceived as a move to avoid further losses.
""Investors should feel as if the financial system is conducting business as usual,"" said Chad Morganlander, senior portfolio manager at Washington Crossing Advisors, in Florham Park, New Jersey.
With state and local governments across the United States taking steps to contain the coronavirus spread, including closing schools, restaurants and other meeting places, questions have swirled about whether stock markets will shutter.
The S&P 500 (SPX) jumped 6% on Tuesday, rebounding from Monday's nearly 12% drop, which was the worst one-day decline since 1987. With the S&P 500 down 25% from its record high on Feb. 19, many investors have been unwilling to predict how much further Wall Street may fall.
On Friday, the NYSE, which is owned by Intercontinental Exchange Inc (N:ICE), issued a trader alert that it aims to keep its equity and options trading floors open ""in the days and weeks ahead."" 
""We absolutely believe in keeping the markets open,"" Mnuchin told reporters.
""We may get to a point where we shorten the hours, if that's something they need to do, but Americans should know that we are going to do everything that they have access to their money at their banks, to the money in their 401(k)s, and to the money in stocks,"" he added.
The last time the NYSE closed due to an unforeseen circumstance was in 2012 after Hurricane Sandy battered New York City. After the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the World Trade Center in New York and the Pentagon in Washington, the NYSE did not reopen until Sept. 17, when the S&P 500 tumbled nearly 5%.
""It's more likely that we would have shorter trading hours than shutting down the market, but I don't believe that will do much of anything,"" said Oliver Pursche, chief market strategist at Bruderman Asset Management in New York.
Dennis Dick, a proprietary trader at Bright Trading LLC in Las Vegas, said a limited overnight trading window for the Chicago Mercantile Exchange's S&P futures, known as E-minis, might help reduce volatility. Late-night trading in E-minis, which is open nearly around the clock, is often thin and volatile and can have a big influence on investors looking for a reference point ahead of Wall Street's opening bell, he said.

""My vote would be not to reduce trading hours, but if they are going to, overnight E-mini trading is the first place I would look,"" Dick said.

FedEx (NYSE:FDX) shares gained 2.4% in after-hours trade.
The earnings beat arrived even as margins slipped to 2.8% from 5.8% driven by numerous headwinds, including weaker global economic conditions amid the novel coronavirus and increased costs from expanded service offerings,
""Operating results declined due to weaker global economic conditions including the impact of the coronavirus, higher self-insurance accruals, an unfavorable variable incentive compensation comparison, increased FedEx Ground costs from expanded service offerings, the loss of business from a large customer, a continuing mix shift to lower-yielding services and a more competitive pricing environment,"" FedEx said.
Looking ahead, the company pulled its full-year earnings guidance due to uncertainty caused by the Covid-19 outbreak and said it would cut costs to offset near-term headwinds.
“We are suspending our fiscal 2020 earnings forecast for our consolidated and segment results due to the uncertainty caused by the coronavirus pandemic,” said CFO Alan B. Graf, Jr. “To mitigate these near-term headwinds and position the company for future earnings growth, we are attacking costs throughout the company by managing capacity, retiring our oldest and least-efficient aircraft, integrating TNT Express, and lowering our residential delivery costs by having FedEx Ground deliver FedEx SmartPost and certain day-definite FedEx Express packages.”

Investing.com – The Dow rebounded from its biggest one-day rout since the 1987 market crash as the Trump administration stoked hopes of a major stimulus package to tackle the Covid-19 outbreak.
The Dow jumped 5.2%, or about 1,049 points, theS&P 500 gained 6% and the Nasdaq Composite added 6.2%.
In an effort to shore up the economy amid fears the Covid-19 outbreak will bring about a recession, the Trump administration is widely believed to put forward proposals for a stimulus package in the range of $850 billion to $1 trillion. The package could include relief for Americans in the form of direct payments and tax breaks and deferred payments. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said the administration wants to mail out checks soon. 
The Federal Reserve, meanwhile, continued its efforts to ensure lending markets continue to function smoothly after getting the green light from Treasury to form a commercial paper funding facility.
The stimulus measures arrived as coronavirus infections in the U.S. gather pace, with cases rising to 5,000 from 1,000 last week, and expected to increase over the coming weeks.
Drug developers worldwide are racing to find a cure, with first patient trials of a potential coronavirus vaccine reported to have begun this week.
The rally on Wall Street sparked a rebound in Treasury yields, with the 10-Year yields rising above the key 1% level, though some are warning of limited upside on worries of a U.S. recession ahead.
The rebound in the yields boosted financials, mostly banks, which benefit from a higher interest rate environment.
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) rose 6%, while Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) rose 2.5% and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) was up more than 7%.
But the biggest gains in the market were seen in defensive corners such as utilities, real estate and consumer staples on bets that further stimulus from central banks worldwide will exacerbate the hunt for yield.
Gains in energy were kept in checked, however, after oil fell 6%, as Trump stoked further concerns about weaker travel demand after suggesting his administration was mulling further travel restrictions."

1160,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 17, 2020 03:07PM ET</span>","U.S. to boost tariffs on Airbus planes Wednesday, adding pressure on airlines","By David Lawder and Andrea Shalal
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States is expected to increase U.S. tariffs on Airbus planes by 50% on Wednesday, U.S. and European officials say, dealing a further blow to U.S. airlines already hammered by sharp drops in travel due to the coronavirus pandemic.
Tariffs on Airbus (PA:AIR) aircraft built in Europe are to increase to 15% from 10% at 12:01 a.m. Wednesday, as Washington pressures the EU to comply with a World Trade Organization ruling on illegal aircraft subsidies.
The EU is prepared to impose tariffs on U.S. goods once the WTO rules on a parallel case challenging U.S. government aid to U.S. planemaker Boeing (N:BA) later this spring.
Several EU officials said they had no indication that Washington would delay the tariff increase, despite calls by the Group of Seven rich nations for cooperation to battle the coronavirus outbreak that has devastated the global economy.
Airbus spokesman Clay McConnell in Washington also said there was no sign of a reprieve. He urged the U.S. government to work out an agreement with the EU and end a dispute over aircraft subsidies that dates back over 15 years.
""The evolution of the global COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on the aviation industry reinforces the need to put this outdated case behind us and find a sustainable way forward for our industry,"" McConnell said.
The tariff increase will not be paid by Airbus, but by U.S. airlines that have been hammered as the virus outbreak has dried up bookings and the Trump administration imposed travel bans from China and Europe.
Major U.S. airlines are seeking more than $50 billion in government help as part of a financial assistance package being drafted by the White House.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told a White House briefing on Tuesday: ""This is worse than 9/11 for the airline industry. They are almost ground to a halt.""
The tariff hike would add to their woes, said one industry source, adding, ""It's yet another burden at a critical time.""
Without U.S. aid, airlines could run out of money by year-end - and even sooner if credit card companies start withholding payments, triggering furloughs of tens of thousands of workers.
A spokesman for the U.S. Trade Representative's office said the U.S. government continued to seek a negotiated outcome and hoped the additional duties would spur Brussels to halt illegal government subsidies to Airbus.
""It’s important to keep in mind that the WTO determined the EU’s massive illegal subsidies to Airbus cost our aerospace companies and workers hundreds of billions of dollars in lost revenue,"" said the spokesman.
EU Trade Commissioner Phil Hogan had hoped to meet with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer during a visit this week, but the trip was canceled amid concerns about the pandemic.
The tariffs do not affect aircraft built by Airbus at its plant in Mobile, Alabama, which is building six aircraft in the A320 series a month, with plans to bolster production to seven planes a month by early 2021, an Airbus spokesman said.
The state of Washington, home to Boeing's commercial aircraft production facilities, last week moved to formally repeal an aerospace tax break that benefited Boeing and avert looming EU tariffs on U.S. goods.
Boeing said the move would bring the United States into compliance with WTO rules, but Airbus said it marked only ""initial steps"" toward resolving the transatlantic dispute."

(Reuters) - Local California officials are evaluating if and how Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) will be allowed to continue operating its main U.S. vehicle factory as the San Francisco Bay Area begins a three-week lockdown to rein in the spread of coronavirus.
A spokesman for California's Alameda County, where Tesla's Fremont factory is located, said on Tuesday the county was consulting its lawyers and health officials to evaluate the situation and provide an answer by the end of the day.
""Part of Tesla's operations might fall under an exemption in the (county's) order, but making cars and pumping them out at the end of the assembly line is another question,"" the spokesman said.
Several media outlets on Monday reported the factory would be allowed to remain open, but a spokesman for Alameda County on Tuesday said there was no definitive answer yet on how to keep workers safe. 
The spokesman said he was also looking to connect with a Tesla official on the matter.
Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the spokesman's remarks.
Tesla's sole U.S. auto factory in Alameda County employs more than 10,000 workers and had annualized production of slightly over 415,000 units by the fourth quarter. 
The county is one of six covered by a 'shelter in place' order from regional authorities that limits activity, travel and business functions to only the most essential, and advises people to stay home except for the most crucial reasons.
So far, automakers and their suppliers have avoided government-mandated production shutdowns in the United States.
The California governor's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on whether the state planned to issue any shutdown guidelines for manufacturing facilities.
The California Department of Public Health said in a statement that more guidance would likely be issued in the days ahead, but did not provide further details.
In an internal memo on Monday, Tesla Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk told employees he was not aware of any who had tested positive for the virus, and urged them to stay home if they felt the ""slightest bit ill or even uncomfortable,"" sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.

Bay Area counties had reported 273 coronavirus infections by Monday. California has reported six deaths from the COVID-19 respiratory illness caused by the virus.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - ThanU.S. President Donald Trump's administration pushed lawmakers to send money directly to Americans to counter the economic toll of the coronavirus outbreak, as the Senate weighed a multibillion-dollar emergency bill passed by the House of Representatives.
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin was poised to meet with Senate Republicans to discuss a plan to send checks to Americans affected by the crisis, and Trump told reporters the payments could amount to $1,000.
The Republican president's tone on the coronavirus pandemic has changed sharply in the past few days. After initially playing down the threat of the outbreak that has spread rapidly across the United States, killing at least 95 people, his administration has begun pushing for urgent action to stem the disease's economic toll.
The administration was talking about a new stimulus package of around $850 billion, one U.S. official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
It would be the third coronavirus aid plan to be considered by Congress just this month. Trump signed the first $8.3 billion package to battle the coronavirus on March 6.
The House over the weekend passed a second measure that would require paid sick leave for some workers and expand unemployment compensation, among other steps, including nearly $1 billion in additional money to help feed children, homebound senior citizens and others.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said his chamber is ""anxious"" to approve the House measure, a move that could take place on Tuesday. 
""The Senate will not adjourn until we have passed significant and bold new steps, above and beyond what the House passed,"" McConnell said on the Senate floor.
Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, however, warned that cutting the payroll tax - one of Trump's favored proposals - ""may be premature and the wrong response"" to fighting the impact of the coronavirus on the economy. Even some Senate Republicans were not enamored of cutting the payroll tax. 
Members of both political parties were talking about large amounts of additional money to help blunt the impact of the fast-spreading disease. The outbreak has killed more than 7,500 people worldwide, caused massive disruptions to daily life across the country and hammered the U.S. stock market that Trump has long touted as a barometer of his administration's performance.
An administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity, early Tuesday said the White House wanted $500 billion in a payroll tax cut, a $50 billion bailout for airlines struggling from plummeting demand, and $250 billion for small business loans.
But when Trump and Mnuchin spoke at midday, their emphasis had shifted; both men noted that a payroll tax cut would take longer.
Schumer has talked of spending $750 billion on things like expanding unemployment insurance, bolstering the Medicaid healthcare program for the poor and funding emergency childcare for healthcare workers.
In the House, Speaker Nancy Pelosi issued a statement laying out what she wanted to see in a third coronavirus aid package, including refundable tax credits for self-employed workers and ensuring that sick workers can get longer-term leave if needed.
""During negotiations, the Democratic House will continue to make clear to the administration that any emergency response package must put families first, before any aid to corporate America is considered,"" Pelosi said.
Senator Kevin Cramer, a Republican ally of Trump, expressed concerns about the size of the proposed third-phase bill, which he said could take the Senate days or even weeks to deliberate.
Republican Senator Mike Braun, another White House ally, said the first priority should be to help small-business employees hit by the outbreak through the unemployment insurance system rather than through the House tax credit and sick leave mandate. He said larger stimulus issues, including a payroll tax cut, can wait.

""I don't think it's wise to spend our money on so-called stimulus, like a payroll tax cut. I think it is a good idea to spend money stabilizing the economy,"" said Senator Lamar Alexander, a Republican. ""The economy's not the problem, the disease is the problem. When we restrain the disease, the economy will bounce back, in my opinion, probably quickly.""

Investing.com – Wall Street resumed its rebound on Tuesday, led by defensive corners of the market after a wave of stimulus and financial initiatives to support the U.S. economy prompted investors to up their bets on stocks.
The Dow jumped 5%, theS&P 500 gained 6.1% and the Nasdaq Composite added 6.1%.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Tuesday the Trump administration was considering handing out emergency funds in the form of checks to Americans to ease the burden stemming from the ongoing Covid-19 virus.
Mnuchin reportedly wants to send out $250 billion worth of checks on a means-tested basis, with the first wave proposed to go out at the end of April, Politico reported. Another wave of checks would be handed out four weeks later if the national emergency declaration remains in place. 
The Federal Reserve, meanwhile, said it had formed a commercial paper funding facility to avert a liquidity crisis and ""support families, businesses and jobs across the economy."" 
There is a ""clear lack of liquidity"" in corporate bond markets, especially high-yield, and price discovery ""remains very difficult,"" amid a lack of bids in for commercial paper conduits, said John Herrmann, rates strategist for the U.S. at MUFG.
In a sign that jitters over the virus continue, defensive sectors of the market powered the rally on Wall Street, with utilities, consumer staples and real estimate sharply higher.
Real estate was boosted by a report that Trump would consider providing help to mortgage payers.

1166,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 17, 2020 02:03PM ET</span>","U.S. Plans to Keep Markets Open, Considering Shorter Hours","(Bloomberg) -- The Trump administration plans to keep U.S. stock markets open despite volatility, though trading hours may be shortened, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said.
“We absolutely believe in keeping the markets open,” Mnuchin said at a Tuesday news conference at the White House. “Americans need to know they have access to their money.”
Mnuchin said he has spoken to banks and the New York Stock Exchange, and they agree on the need to keep markets operating.
Wild swings in equity markets and thousands in the financial industry working from home have led to questions about whether stock exchanges should remain open. But top regulators and executives of exchange firms have come out in favor of keeping markets open.
U.S. indexes climbed on Tuesday, a day after declines triggered circuit breakers that halted trading before the major indexes plunged to their biggest drop since 1987.
Jim Toes, chief executive officer of the Security Traders Association, an industry group, said on Tuesday that markets need to remain open to “deal with the economy.”
“They can’t close the markets,” Toes said. “They’re functioning, they’re working. Unless something breaks, why?”
Spokespeople for the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority -- the main U.S. market regulators -- didn’t immediately respond to e-mailed requests for comment on Mnuchin’s remarks.
SEC Chairman Jay Clayton said Monday that stock markets should continue to operate. Clayton said the current environment differs from previous market shocks, such as the 2008 credit crisis or the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, partly because of steps that have been taken to bolster the financial industry since then.
“I think our banks are in a much stronger position today than they were then,” Clayton said on CNBC. “This is a demand and supply shock,” he said, adding that he’s concerned businesses might not have access to all the credit they need.
Exchanges have largely held up amid surges in volume. That has helped most exchange operators’ stocks outperform the broader market amid the declines.
In a Bloomberg Television interview, Nasdaq Inc. CEO Adena Friedman said trading should continue for the sake of investors and to allow companies to raise needed capital. Closing the markets could “create other pent-up issues,” she said in an interview with Bloomberg’s Erik Schatzker.
Terrence Duffy, the CEO of CME Group Inc. (NASDAQ:CME), the world’s largest futures exchange, said Monday on Bloomberg Television that shutting markets could be “a very large mistake.”
“This is not a financial crisis,” Duffy said. “This is a medical crisis.”
Closing markets would create more market anxiety, said Stacey Cunningham, president of the New York Stock Exchange, in a tweet on Monday.

The stock was the biggest drag on the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) index, shaving off 100 points. 
Rating agency Standard & Poor's on Monday lowered its credit rating on the planemaker to 'BBB' from 'A-' and now expects 2020 free cash flow in a range of negative $11 billion to $12 billion, down from a prior estimate of positive $2 billion.
Reuters reported last week that Boeing is set to draw down the full amount of a $13.8 billion loan, likely bringing its total debt to $41.1 billion.
Boeing's total debt nearly doubled to $27.3 billion in 2019, as it grappled with additional costs related to the 737 MAX grounding and compensated airlines.
The company confirmed it is in talks with senior White House officials and congressional leaders for short-term assistance and a $50 billion bailout both for itself and the aviation sector.
At Tuesday's low, Boeing's shares are down about 74% since the fatal crash of an Ethiopian Airlines plane on March 10 last year.

European Union leaders will on Tuesday discuss via videoconference how to prevent hostile U.S. takeovers of EU-based research firms at the forefront of developing drugs and vaccines against the coronavirus, officials said.
Media reports that Washington had tried to gain access to the vaccine stirred a political backlash in Germany, with economy minister Peter Altmaier and interior minister Horst Seehofer voicing support for keeping CureVac German.
The U.S. overture was first reported by Welt am Sonntag and confirmed to Reuters by German government sources. However, the U.S. ambassador to Germany, Richard Grenell, said on Twitter that the German newspaper report was wrong.
CureVac on Tuesday sought to play down any U.S. move.
""There was and is no offer from the U.S. neither with regard to taking over the company nor to have manufacturing slots reserved exclusively,"" CureVac's acting Chief Executive Franz-Werner Haas told journalists in a conference call, adding that its scientists had also not been lured to relocate.
The Tuebingen-based company, which is backed by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, has said it hopes to have an experimental vaccine ready by June or July and to then seek the go-ahead from regulators for testing on humans.
If successful in clinical trials, the group would be ready to produce up to 10 million doses in one production cycle that typically lasts several weeks. More than one dose may be required to immunize a person.
Output could rise to a billion dosages in a single production cycle, said CureVac's Chief Production Officer Florian von der Muelbe, at a new manufacturing site that the company is planning to build with financial support from the EU.
Others racing to deliver a vaccine include Johnson & Johnson's (N:JNJ),  Moderna  Inc (O:MRNA) and BioNTech .
CureVac did say https://www.curevac.com/news/curevac-ceo-daniel-menichella-ber%C3%A4t-mit-us-pr%C3%A4sident-donald-trump-und-mitgliedern-der-corona-task-force-entwicklungsm%C3%B6glichkeiten-eines-coronavirus-impfstoffes earlier this month that its CEO at the time, Daniel Menichella, met U.S. President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence, members of the White House Coronavirus Task Force and pharmaceutical companies to discuss a vaccine.
SAP (DE:SAPG) co-founder Dietmar Hopp, who owns a more than 80% stake in CureVac, was quoted as saying on Monday that he had also weighed in against a U.S. approach.
Hopp - who is also the owner of German first-division soccer team Hoffenheim - was asked about U.S. interest in exclusive rights to the CureVac vaccine under development by German sports broadcaster Sport1.
""He (Trump) spoke to the company and I was told about it immediately and was asked what I made of it and I knew immediately this was out of the question,"" he was quoted as saying on Sport1's website https://www.sport1.de/fussball/bundesliga/2020/03/corona-dietmar-hopp-ueber-impfstoff-und-kauf-angebot-von-donald-trump.
Hopp and officials representing him were not immediately available to comment.
He had said in a statement on Sunday he was not selling and wanted CureVac to develop a vaccine to ""help people not just regionally but in solidarity across the world."""

LONDON/PARIS (Reuters) - Some of Europe's biggest banks have warned the coronavirus will hit their already under-pressure earnings, as a lockdown in Britain and across parts of continental Europe will slow economic activity, eat into fee income and put corporate borrowers at risk.
 Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) Chief Executive Frederic Oudea said on Tuesday it was too early to say what would be the impact of the virus on the bank's earnings, but that mortgage lending will suffer.
""The production on certain loans will not be very dynamic. Let's be realistic, I don't think that French citizens will particularly go to branches to borrow on the mortgage"", Oudea said in a presentation at the  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) European Financials conference in London.
Britain's Lloyds Banking Group (L:LLOY) will delay part of a 3 billion pound ($3.62 billion) technology investment program in response to the epidemic, Chief Executive Antonio Horta-Osorio told the same conference.
""Now we have a huge external shock, which will provide a delay,"" he told the audience of investors and analysts at the conference.
Lloyds has already spent 2 billion pounds of the plan but could delay deploying the remaining third.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Monday shut down social life in Britain and ordered the most vulnerable to isolate for 12 weeks. The moves, which follow similar actions in Italy and France, are likely to hit banks from multiple angles.
A decline in consumer spending will lower the bank's fee income, Horta-Osorio said, and Lloyds will likely sell fewer mortgages as homebuyers are prevented from viewing potential properties by the social isolation measures.
Spain's Santander (MC:SAN), the euro zone's second biggest bank by market value, offered a more upbeat outlook at the same conference.
The bank's chairman Ana Botin said a ""v-shaped"" scenario of sharp economic decline followed by quick recovery would cut the bank's profits by only 5% this year, excluding any mitigating actions.
With the European banking stock index (SX7P) trading down 40% year-to-date, banks urged investors not to draw comparisons with the 2008 crisis when lenders were the epicenter, saying they have boosted capital and can help the economy recover.
France's biggest bank  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) told investors that its capital has more than doubled since 2008 and that it had 309 billion euros ($339.28 billion)in immediately available liquidity reserves.
Royal Bank of Scotland (L:RBS) Chief Executive Alison Rose said the Bank of England's recent 50 basis point rate cut would likely cost it some 340 million pounds in revenues."

(Reuters) - Wall Street rebounded on Tuesday, following its steepest declines since the 1987 crash, as the Federal Reserve took more steps to boost liquidity in a market sapped by business and travel disruptions in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.
The benchmark S&P 500 (SPX) was up 5% after the central bank relaunched a financial crisis-era purchase of short-term corporate debt.
The move to buy back Commercial Paper follows several emergency measures taken by the U.S. central bank on Sunday, including slashing interest rates to near zero, which sent the main indexes tumbling 12% on Monday.
That was the benchmark S&P 500's (SPX) third-biggest daily percentage drop on record, beaten only by the 1987 rout and the Great Depression crash in 1929 as investors fretted over a looming recession.
""The question is how deep the recession will be; it all depends on the fiscal stimulus of the governments around the world,"" said Elliott Savage, portfolio manager of the YCG Enhanced Fund in Austin, Texas.
""Fiscal stimulus and seeing coronavirus start to peak - those are the two things that investors are most focused on because they are going to tell you what the recovery is going to look like.""
The Trump administration is pursuing a massive $850 billion stimulus package to buttress an economy reeling from the health crisis that has brought major cities in the United States to a standstill.
The head of the U.S. securities regulator on Monday said that U.S. markets should stay open despite intense volatility, quashing speculation that the government might shut down the country's exchanges.
At 12:29 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) was up 745.20 points, or 3.69%, at 20,933.72, while the S&P 500 (SPX) was up 116.44 points, or 4.88%, at 2,502.57. The Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) was up 358.52 points, or 5.19%, at 7,263.11.
All the 11 S&P sectors were trading in the black, led by the defensive utilities (SPLRCU), real estate <.SPLRCR> and consumer staples (SPLRCS) rising between 6% and 9.8%.
Healthcare stocks were another bright spot as  Pfizer  Inc (N:PFE) gained 5.2% after signing a deal with Germany's BioNTech SE <22UAy.F> to co-develop a potential coronavirus vaccine.
Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc (O:REGN) jumped 12.3% after the company said it had identified antibodies to potentially treat COVID-19.
Boeing Co's (N:BA) shares tumbled as much as 22% to a more-than-six-year low on Tuesday following a rating downgrade that reflected its worsening cash flow due to the extended grounding of its 737 MAX jet and the blow from the coronavirus pandemic.
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 1.70-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and by a 2.30-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.

The S&P index recorded seven new 52-week highs and 199 new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded five new highs and 768 new lows.

U.S. stocks rebounded from the biggest rout since 1987 after the Federal Reserve reintroduced additional crisis-era tools to stabilize financial markets roiled by the coronavirus. Treasuries slipped and stresses appeared in the short-term funding and front-edit credit markets.
Investors continue to struggle to adjust to an unprecedented upheaval in social interactions that looks set to plunge the world into recession. The S&P 500’s gain topped 5%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average notched a 4% gain.
Treasuries declined, reversing part of a nearly 25 basis-point surge on Monday. The three-month dollar Libor rate jumped the most since 2008, and similar maturity cross currency basis swaps for euro-dollar, a proxy for how expensive it is to get the greenback, traded at the widest since 2011.
“What a crazy day, people just don’t know what to do,” said Matt Maley, equity strategist at Miller Tabak & Co. “There’s confusion. People don’t have a good idea about the future fundamentals. Right now because of the coronavirus we have no idea.”
With the coronavirus grinding the global economy toward a standstill and central banks central banks dramatically stepping up efforts to stabilize capital markets and liquidity, traders are now clamoring for fiscal stimulus, particularly in the U.S. The Trump administration asked Congress for $850 billion to combat the virus’s effects, a third attempt to juice government spending.
Data showed U.S. retail sales fell in February, indicating the main driver of the economy, consumer spending, had begun to slow even before outbreak containment measures began. Companies began to scramble for cash, with Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC), Caesars and MGM drawing down credit lines.
In the latest attempts to stem the spread of the virus, Hong Kong was set to issue its second-highest travel alert for residents and extend quarantine measures for people coming from abroad. The Philippines became the first country to shut its financial markets, though it aims to reopen Thursday. The U.K. advised against traveling for 30 days.
“A bear market does not preclude rallies,” said Eleanor Creagh, market strategist at Saxo Capital Markets. “The biggest rallies can be in bear markets -- erratic swings are exacerbated by the present high-volatility regime and strained liquidity conditions. With VIX remaining significantly above the long-term equilibrium, alarm bells are still sounding and traders should be wary of relief rallies.”
While Congress is still working on a package, New Zealand announced a NZ$12.1 billion ($7.3 billion) plan and Australia’s government is preparing to scale up just days after announcing a A$17.6 billion ($10.7 billion) initiative.
Elsewhere, Australian stocks posted their biggest jump since 1997 while benchmarks in Hong Kong and China saw more muted moves. The yuan weakened, with economists starting to forecast a contraction in China’s economy for the current quarter. Emerging-market shares fell and oil fluctuated.

Cash holdings in March surged to an average 5.1%, just shy of the 5.5% seen during the 2008 financial crisis, as equity allocations were in a record collapse, mainly led by Eurozone and emerging markets, the survey showed.
World stocks have lost nearly a third or $21 trillion in value since mid-February as the epicenter of the virus shifted from China to Europe.
BofA said the worries triggered a slump in global growth expectations which saw their biggest drop ever in the bank's 26-year poll history.
Investors managing $516 billion said the virus was seen as the biggest ""tail risk"" for markets. The ""most crowded"" trade was in long U.S. Treasuries, a safe-haven.

Bars, food-joints and other places that draw crowds have been shut down in major cities around the world as part of efforts to promote social distancing.
McDonald's,  Starbucks Corp  (O:SBUX) and a string of other restaurant chains have now shifted to take-away and delivery services in the United States.

Investing.com -- The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell below 20,000 for the first time since February 2017 on Tuesday, as a brief attempt at bargain-hunting ran into a wave of fresh selling. 
By 10:40 AM ET (1440 GMT), the DJIA had recovered a liltle to be at 20,134 points, down 54 points, or 0.3% on the day. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite were both up 1.6% albeit in choppy trading.
The moves came against a backdrop of reports suggesting further emergency measures from the Federal Reserve are possible in the near term. 
Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester, who voted against the emergency rate cut at the weekend, said she would support the reintroduction of Fed purchases of commercial paper - last seen during the 2009 financial crisis - if market liquidity continued to deteriorate. 
The Fed will conduct a $500 billion overnight repo operation later Tuesday. 
Analysts at Pantheon Macroeconomics warned that it was impossible to see a bottom to the market until the shape and scale of the U.S. fiscal response to the crisis becomes clearer.
""We don't know yet whether Congress will spend, say, 2% of GDP or 10%. We hope for the latter, but given that the very modest first-stage House bill has not yet passed the Senate, it's hard to be wildly optimistic just yet,"" chief economist Ian Shepherdson wrote in a note to clients.
Boeing continued its descent after its debt was downgraded late on Monday by Standard & Poor's, citing a materially worse outlook for the company's cash flow. Boeing (NYSE:BA) stock was down 18.2% and has now lost some two-thirds of its value since the Covid-19 outbreak exploded in February.   Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) stock rebounded 4.2%, after it announced it was looking at ways to cut capital expenditure and conserve cash in response to S&P downgrading its debt to AA from AA+ on Monday. That was despite further declines in the price of Crude Oil, as Saudi Arabia detailed its plans to ramp up exports, intensifying the new price war.
Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock rose 5.1% after The Wall Street Journal reported that it intends to increase its workforce by some 12% - or 100,000 workers - to cope with a surge in demand for online shopping and delivery as more and more people find themselves in self-isolation at home.  Amazon said on Tuesday it intends to stop delivery of everything but medical supplies and household staples to its warehouses as it struggles with the capacity bottleneck.
Tesla  (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock fell 4.9%, meanwhile, against a backdrop of reports that it intends to keep its Fremont factory in the San Francisco bay area open despite the new lockdown measures announced by local authorities. The company said on Monday it had delivered its first Model Y crossover SUV, but the sales outlook remains clouded by the global problems sweeping the car industry. Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), the world's biggest carmaker, said earlier Tuesday it will suspend production at most of its plants across Europe from the end of the week.

SYDNEY/PARIS (Reuters) - Boeing (NYSE:BA) and other U.S. aviation companies are seeking billions of dollars in aid as they battle to survive a plunge in demand caused by the coronavirus pandemic, while Airbus is pausing production at two sites to bolster health and safety measures.
The rapid spread of the virus across the world has battered airlines as governments have introduced travel restrictions and consumers have stopped making bookings, calling into question the survival of several companies.
To preserve cash, airlines are cutting flights, laying off staff, suspending dividends, selling planes and flying cargo on empty passenger jets.
""It's now fair to call this the single biggest shock that global aviation has ever experienced,"" Qantas Airways Ltd CEO Alan Joyce said in a memo to the airline's 30,000 staff on Tuesday that was seen by Reuters.
 Boeing Co  on Monday said it was in talks with senior White House officials and congressional leaders about short-term assistance for the entire U.S. aviation sector.
U.S. airlines and cargo carriers have said they are seeking at least $58 billion in loans and grants along with additional tax changes, while airports are seeking $10 billion.
European airlines have also stepped up calls for emergency government aid. Passenger traffic across the region slumped by more than half on average last week, and the situation will worsen as borders closed, trade body Airports Council International Europe said.
Industry consultancy Tourism Economics forecast international travel will slump at least 10.5% this year, the biggest year-on-year drop.
Planemaker Airbus SE said on Tuesday it would pause production and assembly at its French and Spanish sites for the next four days to put in place strict health and safety provisions.
British infrastructure and aviation group Stobart said it likely needed additional liquidity because of the disruption to its business, especially at London Southend Airport.
Airbus shares were down more than 7% at 0930 GMT after heavy losses on Monday. Boeing shares closed down 24% on Monday.
In Asia, Qantas, which is looking to raise a few hundred million dollars by refinancing some aircraft, said on Tuesday it planned to cut international capacity by 90% and domestic capacity by 60% until at least the end of May.
""Our goal is to protect as many jobs as possible and to make sure we remain strong enough to ride this out,"" Joyce told staff in the memo seen by Reuters.
New Zealand's Auckland International Airport said on Monday it would scrap its interim dividend after freezing hiring and halting discretionary spending.
Air New Zealand said it would cut capacity to Australia by 80% from March 30 to June 30 after both countries said over the weekend that all travelers would need to self-isolate for 14 days after arrival.
Australian airports are set to lose more than A$500 million ($307 million) in take-off and landing fees, the Australian Airports Association said.
Avinor, a state-owned Norwegian company, said on Tuesday the number of passengers traveling from the country's airports fell 40% in the week ending March 15 from the same period a year earlier.
The only bright spot for airlines is the cargo market, where rates are surging as a result of the loss of capacity in the belly of passenger aircraft as those flights are cut. Airlines are flying some planes without passengers to transport cargo due to high demand.

RAISING CASH
Simon Birmingham, Australia's minister for tourism, said on Tuesday that neither Qantas nor smaller rival Virgin Australia Holdings Ltd had asked for a bailout, but that the government had not ruled out providing assistance.
""They believe they are viable and have strong cash positions ... but we want to make sure we maintain that confidence in the airlines,"" Birmingham told reporters.
Hong Kong's Cathay Pacific Airways said on Monday it had agreed a $703.8 million deal with lessor BOC Aviation to sell and lease back six Boeing 777-300ER airplanes to raise cash.
The carrier, one of the earliest and hardest hit by the outbreak due to its proximity to mainland China where the virus originated, said its full-service airlines, Cathay Pacific and Cathay Dragon, had made an unaudited loss of HK$2 billion ($257.5 million) in February alone.
Cathay Pacific plans to cut up to 90% of its capacity in April.
""If we do not see a relaxation of travel restrictions in the near future, we expect the same arrangement will have to continue into May,"" Cathay Pacific Group Chief Customer and Commercial Officer Ronald Lam said in a statement.
Japan's ANA Holdings said it would cut 2,630 more international flights serving 58 routes between March 29 and April 24.
Philippines' Cebu Pacific said it would cancel all flights from March 19 to April 14 after stringent quarantine orders."

1215,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 17, 2020 09:18AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Airbus signals government help needed if crisis lasts months - sources,"By Ilona Wissenbach, Christian Kraemer and Klaus Lauer
FRANKFURT/BERLIN (Reuters) - Europe's Airbus (PA:AIR) has signaled that some government support may be needed if the coronavirus crisis lasts for several months, three people familiar with the matter said.
The prospect of a worst-case scenario in which state help becomes necessary was raised in crisis talks on Monday between Germany's economy ministry and aviation industry representatives including Franco-German-led Airbus, they said.
The type of any government support, and how widely it would be distributed, was not discussed in detail, but most likely options include efforts to promote liquidity such as state-guaranteed credits, one source said.
""We are having regular dialogues with our home nation governments which are all non-public in nature which is why we do not comment on them,"" an Airbus spokesman said. The German economy ministry did not respond to a request for comment.
U.S. rival Boeing (N:BA) also confirmed talks with White House officials and congressional leaders about short-term assistance for itself and the entire aviation sector.
Boeing said on Monday that ready short-term access to public and private liquidity would be one of ""the most important ways"" for airlines, airports, suppliers and manufacturers to recover. 
So far there has been no discussion of dedicated bailouts or direct cash injections for the aerospace sector, but liquidity is an overriding concern, industry sources said.
Airlines worldwide have suspended or slowed taking jet deliveries and asked governments for broad financial support including loan guarantees.
Aviation stocks have fallen sharply across the board, with Airbus down 9% at 1307 GMT on Tuesday, a day after Boeing plunged 24%.
Airbus has about 16 billion euros in cash and needs some 5.5 billion euros a month, a person familiar with Monday's discussions said.
It is not receiving pre-payments from customers - usually a key source of cash to keep activities running smoothly - while its cash position has also been dented by the payment of a record 3.6 billion euro fine to settle a bribery case in February.
Although the coronavirus epidemic has caused exceptional upheaval, the timing and scope of any bids by planemakers for public support is a sensitive issue as Airbus and Boeing near the climax of a 16-year trade dispute over subsidies. 
The United States imposed tariffs on Airbus jets last year and the European Union aims to win approval to hit back with counter-tariffs in May, though Boeing last week argued it had shut the door on this by giving up a Washington state tax break.
Some European industry executives have called for a truce in the long-running trade war while the coronavirus crisis lasts, arguing tariffs would add to financial pressure on airlines.

On Tuesday, Airbus said it was halting production at French and Spanish plants for four days after French President Emmanuel Macron announced new measures to restrict people's movements.

The company said on Monday that it was halting production for two weeks at most of its European plants to help to protect staff and adjust to a slump in demand.
The Atessa plant had been closed since last week as the company performed deep sanitization and some reconfiguration of production lines to allow more space between workers.
""Operations have restarted with the number of workers reduced by around 45%,"" the FCA spokesman said, adding that workers placed on temporary leave will receive benefits through the 'cassa integrazione' wage-guarantee fund.
Located in the central Italian region of Abruzzo and operated by Sevel, a joint venture between the Italian-American automaker and France's PSA-Peugeot (PA:PEUP), the plant usually produces about 300,000 light commercial vehicles annually.
UILM union representative Gianluca Ficco said the plant, which employs about 5,000 people, was running on Tuesday with roughly 60% of its staff.
""We are ascertaining day by day, in FCA and in all other companies, that the health measures decided by the government are fully met,"" he said. ""Our aim is to combine security and jobs"".
The Italian government on Saturday agreed with companies and trade union leaders a series of measures to improve health controls in factories, offices and other workplaces that have been allowed to stay open during the country's coronavirus lockdown.
However, trade unions have reported several strikes over recent days all over Italy, with worker representatives saying that implemented measures were insufficient.
A source close to the matter said that FCA does not plan further stoppages to Atessa operations."

U.S. equity futures fluctuated on Tuesday and European stocks dropped as investors struggled to find their feet after the biggest plunge on Wall Street since 1987. The dollar jumped, while Treasuries retreated with gold.
It was another day of volatility, with contracts on American share gauges at one point rising by their daily limits in the wake of the biggest sell-off since the Black Monday crash. They went on to swing between gains and losses as new signs of stress emerged in short-term funding markets, where the premium for getting dollars against the euro exploded to the widest since 2011.
The greenback itself surged against almost all its major peers as the yield on 10-year Treasuries rose after plummeting almost a quarter percentage point Monday. European bonds tracked that drop, while the Stoxx Europe 600 Index swung from a big gain to big loss. Equities in Asia endured a similarly volatile session.
American stocks slumped into the closing bell on Monday after President Donald Trump warned of a possible recession, with economic disruption from the coronavirus potentially extending into summer. In the latest attempts to stem the spread of the virus, Hong Kong was set to issue its second-highest travel alert for residents and extend quarantine measures for people coming from abroad. The Philippines became the first country to shut its financial markets, though it aims to reopen Thursday.
“A bear market does not preclude rallies,” said Eleanor Creagh, market strategist at Saxo Capital Markets. “In fact, the biggest rallies can be in bear markets -- erratic swings are exacerbated by the present high-volatility regime and strained liquidity conditions. With VIX remaining significantly above the long-term equilibrium, alarm bells are still sounding and traders should be wary of relief rallies.”
After the Federal Reserve and other central banks dramatically stepped up efforts to stabilize capital markets and liquidity, traders are looking to fiscal authorities for action. While Congress is still working on a package, New Zealand announced a NZ$12.1 billion ($7.3 billion) plan and Australia’s government is preparing to scale up just days after announcing a A$17.6 billion ($10.7 billion) initiative.
Elsewhere, Australian stocks posted their biggest jump since 1997 while benchmarks in Hong Kong and China saw more muted moves. The yuan weakened, with economists starting to forecast a contraction in China’s economy for the current quarter. Emerging-market shares fell and oil fluctuated.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are set to edge higher at the open Tuesday, barely rebounding from Monday’s crash following promises of action from the leaders of the world’s advanced economies. Confidence remains weak with investors fearing the coronavirus pandemic will cause a protracted economic slowdown.
At 7:20 AM ET (1120 GMT),  the S&P 500 Futures traded 33 points, or 1.4%, higher,  the Nasdaq 100 Futures contract was up 156 points, or 2.2%, while the Dow Jones 30 Futures contract rose 265 points, or 1.2%. 
Leaders from the Group of Seven countries issued a statement promising to “do whatever it takes” to tackle the health and economic risks from the coronavirus outbreak following a conference call late Monday. 
This has somewhat helped the tone following Wall Street's steepest fall since 1987 on Monday, when U.S. President Donald Trump warned that the Covid-19 outbreak could last through August and possibly tip the U.S. economy into recession.
The three indices have plunged about 30% from their record closing highs hit in mid-February and ended the U.S. stock market's record 11-year bull run.
In corporate news, U.S. airlines have approached the federal government with a request for $50 billion in financial assistance, plus tax relief, as they struggle with a crisis that threatens to eclipse even the period after the 9/11 attacks.
Airlines for America, the industry association, said on its website it has asked for grants of up to $25 billion and loans of up to another $25 billion. According to Bloomberg, the industry spent 96% of its free cash flow over the last decade on stock buybacks, rather than building financial reserves.
Additionally, Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Tuesday began suspending shared rides on its ride-hailing platform in the United States and Canada to limit the spread of the coronavirus.
There are a number of economic releases for February due later Tuesday, including retail sales at 8:30 AM ET and industrial production at 9:15 AM ET, but these numbers are unlikely to have much of an impact given that they predate the outbreak's impact on U.S. society. 
Elsewhere, the oil market has turned positive, but gains are still limited in view of the hit to demand from the virus-induced economic slowdown and a price war between Saudia Arabia and Russia.
The API weekly crude oil stocks data are due after the close at 4:30 PM ET.

PARIS (Reuters) - Airbus (PA:AIR) announced plans to halt operations at its plants in France and Spain for four days as the coronavirus crisis spread from battered airlines to the manufacturing sector.
The most serious across-the-board disruption in Airbus production since a strike at then British partner BAE Systems (LON:BAES) in 1989 pushed its shares down 7% as a rebound in other European shares quickly faltered. 
""This will allow sufficient time to implement stringent health and safety conditions in terms of hygiene, cleaning and self-distancing, while improving the efficiency of operations under the new working conditions,"" Airbus said in a statement. 
The ""pause"" in output came after Reuters exclusively reported on Monday that Airbus had drawn up contingency plans to slow or stop production if France was placed under a drastic lockdown due to coronavirus.
French President Emmanuel Macron late on Monday ordered stringent restrictions on people's movements to slow the spread of the coronavirus.
At mid-morning, Airbus shares were down 7.1% versus a 1% decline in France's CAC40 (FCHI) blue-chip index.
France's aerospace capital of Toulouse is home to Airbus's largest assembly plants as well its headquarters. Its suppliers are also expected to be hit hard by the crisis.
It assembles the narrow-body A320 series there as well as all wide-body aircraft such as the A330 and A350 and the last remaining units of the A380, whose output is being wound down.
French factories also provide the cockpit section and central wingbox for all Airbus planes as well as the pylons, which connect engines to the wings.
In Spain, Airbus builds part of the tail section for its aircraft and assembles A400M military transporters.
Other assembly lines include A319, A321 and more A320s in Hamburg, Germany, as well as overseas production outposts for A320 and A321 aircraft in Mobile, Alabama, and Tianjin, China.
Airbus produces the smaller A220 jetliner in Montreal and Mobile after acquiring it from Bombardier (TO:BBDb).
Factories in Britain, where Airbus makes wings, or Germany, where it builds part of its fuselages and has its second-largest cluster of assembly lines, can operate for several days.
Deliveries have already been disrupted as crisis-hit airlines hold back from taking possession of aircraft in order to conserve cash, industry sources say. 

U.S. rival Boeing (N:BA) said on Monday it was deploying all its resources to sustain its operations.

LONDON (Reuters) - Borrowing costs for junk-rated European companies have nearly tripled in less than a month, and with the market for new debt issuance shuttered, there could be a lot more pain in store for firms needing to raise fresh money to redeem debt.
The yield on the iBoxx euro liquid high-yield index, which tracks 250 corporate bonds with sub-investment grade ratings, spiked to a seven-year high on Monday of just over 7%, according to Refinitiv data.
On Feb. 20, when the spread of coronavirus was just starting to spook investors, the average yield on the index was 2.69%, less than 100 basis points off record lows set in 2017.
Now, just halfway through March, the yield is on course for its biggest monthly rise since October 2008, when markets were dealing with the effects of investment bank Lehman Brothers' collapse.
(Graphic: Junk borrowing costs spike, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/3548/3509/junk%20borrowing%20costs.png)
Many individual issues are faring even worse -- yields on 2027 subordinated bonds from Legoland owner Merlin Entertainments have shot up to nearly 10%, up more than 6 percentage points in three weeks, according to Tradeweb.
But even these levels may not tell the whole story. With liquidity drying up in these riskier assets, funds trying to offload any sizeable holdings are having to sell at lower prices than quoted on trading platforms, market players said.
""What we're hearing is that, what we're seeing on the screens, that's just indicative,"" said an official at a high-yield debt syndicate at a European bank.
There is likely more to come, with  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) revising targets for the European high-yield market on Monday to recession levels at a spread of over 1,000 basis points.
That will exacerbate stress for asset managers in the sector -- JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) said European high-yield funds it tracks have lost close to 6% of their assets in the past two weeks, with outflows topping 4 billion euros.
WHAT NEXT
The problem could go beyond soaring borrowing costs. With the European market for high-yield bond sales shut since Feb. 20, it is difficult to gauge who will be able to borrow when the market eventually reopens and at what price deals will get done.
""The high-yield and leveraged loan market is pretty well shut for the next bit. I think it's very difficult to take any comfort in what's going to happen in the market on a day to day basis,"" said a senior banker who arranges bond sales for junk-rated companies.
Names with significant amounts of debt due for repayment next year include Germany's Thyssenkrupp (DE:TKAG),  Telecom Italia  (MI:TLIT) and shipping giant CMA CGM, according to 9fin, a data provider focused on high-yield markets.
Around 38 billion euros of debt by junk-rated corporates and financial issuers in European currencies will mature by the end of 2021, according to Fitch Ratings.
Philip Hertz, restructuring partner at law firm Clifford Chance, said industries damaged by coronavirus and with debt falling due in the next six to 24 months are the ones to watch.
The cost of insuring against high-yield European borrower defaults has risen to eight-year highs in recent sessions.
""You have to ask yourself, are they going to be able to refinance where the market is? Are they going to be able to put their balance sheets behind that?"" Hertz said.
""They've got to start thinking about it now. If they can't refi, they've got to think about restructuring."""

(Reuters) - European shares retreated after an initial bounce on Tuesday as damage being heaped on companies and economies across the globe from the coronavirus grew and kept financial markets on edge.
Sharp restrictions on large gatherings, shutdowns of major cities and disruptions to business supply chains are taking a toll on corporate Europe. The world's biggest catering firm  Compass Group  (L:CPG) and automaker Volkswagen Group (DE:VOWG_p) were the latest to warn of a hit from the pandemic.
Compass tumbled 22.2% and Volkswagen dropped 3%.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index (STOXX) was down 1.1% after rising as much as 3.7% in early trading, following a dramatic sell-off on Monday that dragged it to levels last seen in 2012.
""With the news flow evolving quite rapidly and liquidity tight, we're likely to see continued bouts of volatility, which suggests that it's not a particularly sensible time to be trying to do anything too aggressive from a trading perspective,"" said Toby Gibb, head of investment directing at Fidelity International in London.
""It is absolutely going to create a lot of (buying) opportunities, but it doesn't feel like a good time to be locking in losses.""
All of the 19 European sub-indexes were trading in red, with travel and leisure stocks (SXTP) plummeting 10% as drastic containment measures forced airlines to make unprecedented cuts to flights, costs and staffing.
British Airways parent IAG (L:ICAG), EasyJet (L:EZJ), Ryanair (I:RYA) and Air France-KLM (PA:AIRF) were again among the biggest decliners on the STOXX 600, bringing the wider travel sub-index's total declines in the first quarter to over 50%.
Wall Street had recorded its worst decline on Monday since the 1987 ""Black Monday"" crash as the unchecked spread of the virus wiped out liquidity from financial markets and sent volatility to record highs.
A coordinated effort by global central banks to flush more cash into the system only added to the alarm around a looming global recession.
Airbus (PA:AIR) tumbled 6.7% after saying it would stop production and assembly activities at its plants in France and Spain for the next four days in order to comply with the government's containment measures.

LONDON (Reuters) - World share markets and oil prices struggled on Tuesday after coronavirus panic caused Wall Street's worst one-day rout since the Black Monday crash of 1987. 
In Europe, early 1.5.% to 3% gains in London, Frankfurt and Paris were quickly wiped out as airline and travel stocks (SXTP) suffered a 6.5% drubbing. 
The dollar recouped some lost ground against the safe-haven Japanese yen . Oil gave up attempted gains after Brent's drop below $30 a barrel on Monday.
""We saw quite a staggering drop yesterday, so it might just be a bit of calm after that storm,"" said Rabobank analyst Bas Van Geffen. ""But we are not sure."" 
Financial markets cratered on Monday with the S&P 500 (SPX) tumbling 12%. Emergency central bank rate cuts globally only added to the investor panic.
Tuesday's stabilization saw Australian shares (AXJO) close 5.9% higher, their biggest daily percentage gain since October 2008, after plunging nearly 10% on Monday. 
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares (MIAPJ0000PUS) and Japan's Nikkei (N225) both finished steady. South Korea (KS11) finished down 2.4%, however, and the Philippines became the first country to suspend all trading over the virus.
Futures trade still pointed to a positive open in U.S. markets. The S&P 500 e-minis (ESc1), were up 1%, although earlier they had been up 3.8%. 
Some $2.7 trillion in market value was wiped from the S&P 500 on Monday as it suffered its third-largest daily percentage decline on record. Over the past 18 days, the benchmark index has lost $8.3 trillion. World stocks (MIWD00000PUS) have hemorrhaged over 15 trillion.
""The move in U.S. stock futures prompted some buying of battered down shares and lifted dollar/yen,"" said Junichi Ishikawa, senior FX strategist at IG Securities in Tokyo.
""The focus is shifting to the fiscal response to the virus. We're locked in a pattern where markets bounce and then resume falling.""
WAITING FOR HELP
Gold, which is normally bought as a safe haven, extended declines on Tuesday as some investors chose to sell whatever they could to keep their money in cash. 
The U.S. Federal Reserve stunned investors with another emergency rate cut on Sunday, prompting other central banks to ease policy in the biggest coordinated response since the global financial crisis more than a decade ago.
Investors, however, are worried that many have used up their ammunition and that more draconian restrictions on personal movement are necessary to contain the global coronavirus outbreak.
Group of Seven finance ministers are expected to hold a call on Tuesday night. Markets want to see public health progress as well as fiscal stimulus. 
""I think the priorities of the governments around the world will probably move away from economic growth towards containing the virus,"" said Jim McCafferty, Nomura's joint head of APAC equity research.
""Safety of national citizens might become a bigger priority. But with that they want to keep the economies in a working situation.""
Traders are also looking to data due later, which is forecast to show German investor sentiment tumbled in March.
The United States will release retail sales and industrial production for February, but that is unlikely to reflect the impact of the coronavirus just yet.
Some investors say markets will not settle unless the U.S. government announces a big fiscal spending package to match the Fed's rate cuts and efforts to keep credit markets functioning.
Others say liquidity in some financial markets is starting to fall because there's such a high degree of uncertainty, meaning even some of the usual safe havens may not be that safe. 
In the currency market, the dollar rose 0.5% to 106.40 yen , after a 2% decline the day before, when the Fed's rate cut rippled through financial markets.
Germany's benchmark 10-year Bund yield rose to a one-month high in bond markets on growing expectations of a government spending blast.
Long-dated German bond yields have jumped 50 basis points from record lows hit just over a week ago. Borrowing costs in France and Spain have hit their highest since last May.

U.S. equity futures reversed an advance and European stocks dropped as investors struggled to find their feet after the biggest plunge on Wall Street since 1987. Treasuries fell alongside the yen and gold.
Contracts on the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 indexes at one point rose by their daily limits after the biggest market loss since 1987, though they gave up the gains in the European morning. The Stoxx Europe 600 Index opened in the green after its lowest close in almost seven years, but it couldn’t hold the move and turned lower. Asia also saw a volatile session, with Australian equities posting their biggest jump since 1997 while benchmarks in Hong Kong and China saw more muted moves.
The yield on 10-Year Treasuries rose after plummeting almost a quarter percentage point Monday. The dollar strengthened against all its major counterparts except the South African rand.
American stocks slumped into the closing bell on Monday after President Donald Trump warned of a possible recession, with economic disruption from the coronavirus potentially extending into summer. In the latest attempts to stem the spread of the virus, Hong Kong was set to issue its second-highest travel alert for residents and extend quarantine measures for people coming from abroad. The Philippines became the first country to shut its financial markets, though it aims to reopen Thursday.
“A bear market does not preclude rallies,” said Eleanor Creagh, market strategist at Saxo Capital Markets. “In fact, the biggest rallies can be in bear markets -- erratic swings are exacerbated by the present high-volatility regime and strained liquidity conditions. With VIX remaining significantly above the long-term equilibrium, alarm bells are still sounding and traders should be wary of relief rallies.”
After the Federal Reserve and other central banks dramatically stepped up efforts to stabilize capital markets and liquidity, traders are looking to fiscal authorities for action. While Congress is still working on a package, New Zealand announced a NZ$12.1 billion ($7.3 billion) plan and Australia’s government is preparing to scale up just days after announcing a A$17.6 billion ($10.7 billion) initiative.

1230,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 17, 2020 05:52AM ET</span>",StockBeat: Volkswagen's Shutdown - a Continent in Microcosm,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- Europe’s economy is grinding to a halt because of the coronavirus, and there’s little telling when it will start up again.
Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), the world’s biggest auto maker and the biggest private-sector employer across the continent, said it will suspend production this week at plants in Italy, Portugal, Slovakia and Spain and will shut down the rest of its factories across Europe in due course.
The shutdown is initially planned to run for two weeks. The measures don’t come as much of a surprise, given that Germany, like other countries in Europe, is imposing increasingly severe restrictions on all walks of daily life.
The move will be felt along the length of one of the world’s most extensive supply chains, a stark illustration of how the virus is freezing economic activity.
“2020 is a very difficult year,” chief executive Herbert Diess told a press conference as he unveiled the company’s annual results. “The corona pandemic presents us with unknown operational and financial challenges. At the same time, there are concerns about sustained economic impacts.”
VW – like many others – isn’t giving guidance for 2020, citing the extreme lack of visibility created by Covid-19.
VW and the other big-name German car brands can typically rely on extensive support from the German state when they run into trouble. It’s usually their suppliers that end up taking most of the strain from temporary collapsed in demand.
VW’s preferred stock was down a relatively modest 3.5% by 5:50 AM ET (0950 GMT), while those of its biggest suppliers, such as were all down by more. Schaeffler stock fell 9.9%, Hella stock fell by 5.7% and Continental stock fell by 3.6%, all anticipating similar shutdowns by  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) and BMW (MI:BMW). The benchmark Dax index was down 1.7%, while the Stoxx 600 was down 2.0%, spooked by short-selling bans in France, Spain and Italy.
VW preferred stock is now down 47% for the year to date and trades at a trailing price-earnings ratio of 3.65. However, such traditional value metrics have temporarily lost any meaning as investors refuse to take on risk at any price.
The shame for VW is that it entered 2020 in relatively good shape, having made decent progress in ramping up output of electric vehicles and meeting new emissions regulations, and having avoided a hard Brexit. Revenue rose 4.5% to 88.4 billion euros ($97 billion) while underlying operating profit rose 19% to 3.8 billion euros.
Nice numbers, but – for now at least – utterly irrelevant. The only thing matters for the foreseeable future is how long those billions of euros of capital invested in VW’s fixed assets are shut, and to what extent the government, lenders and the European Central Bank will share the burden of keeping its workforce idle. And that is a question that applies, mutatis mutandis, across the whole of the European economy."

Investing.com - European stock markets turned red Tuesday, as evidence of the coronavirus hitting corporate Europe outweighed news of more central bank largesse and promises of action from the G7 and the Eurogroup.
At 05:15 ET (0915 GMT), the U.K.'s FTSE index was trading 1.4% lower, France's CAC 40 was down 1.1%, while the DAX was down 1.4%. The pan-eurozone index, the Euro Stoxx 50, dropped 1.0%. 
The mood darkened as regulators in France, Spain and Italy all instituted short-selling bans on selected stocks. The Spanish ban will run for a month, while the French and Italian ones will run only for the day to start with. French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said his country's ban may be extended.
The grim corporate newsflow out of Europe continued Tuesday. German carmaker Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) is set to announce a suspension of its production from Saturday due to the coronavirus pandemic, the company's works council said on Tuesday.
Similarly, French carmaker  Renault  (PA:RENA) said that it was halting operations in Spain following the declaration of a state of emergency there in light of the coronavirus crisis.
Airbus (PA:AIR) is also stopping production and assembly activities at its plants in France and Spain for the next four days as governments there implement new measures to restrict movements and fight the coronavirus outbreak, the planemaker said on Tuesday.
Earlier Tuesday, the Bank of Japan pumped more than $30 billion into markets with an 84-day dollar funding operation. This move came after the world's six major central banks took a joint step to provide more cash dollars on Sunday as a rout in financial markets over the past week led to a scramble by banks and companies for dollar liquidity. In addition, the U.S. Federal Reserve cut short-term rates to near zero while pledging hundreds of billions of dollars in asset purchases.
Tuesday’s bounce follows hefty losses in Europe on Monday, while the Dow suffered its biggest one-day plunge ever, falling almost 3,000 points, after President Donald Trump said the worst of the outbreak could last through the summer and that it was not currently under control.
Looking at economic indicators, the U.K. unemployment numbers for January are due at 0530 AM ET (0930 GMT), but these figures have largely been made outdated by events. However, the German ZEW economic sentiment release for March, at 0600 AM ET, will be of interest as a gauge of the mood among the country’s investors as the coronavirus pandemic takes hold.
Oil markets have pushed back above the $30 a barrel level Tuesday, helped by the prospect of U.S. and other countries filling strategic storage. That said, it’s debatable how long this will support prices given the major hit to demand and the sharp increase in supply resulting from the collapse of the OPEC+ output restraint pact. 
AT 05:15 AM ET (0915 GMT), U.S. crude futures traded 1.7% higher at $29.50 a barrel and the international benchmark Brent contract up 0.3% at $30.15. 
Additionally, gold futures fell 0.2% to $1,483.70/oz, while EUR/USD traded at 1.1116, down 0.6% on the day.

Futures pointed to declines of as much as 4% in Tokyo and Sydney, with Hong Kong contracts also lower after the S&P 500 Index sank 12% and erased its gain for 2019. U.S. stocks extended losses as Trump said the economy could fall into a recession. Central bank stimulus around the world failed to mollify investors worried about the damage the coronavirus is inflicting on economies. Treasuries rallied, crude oil plunged almost 10% and the yen climbed.
“This is different. The thing that is scarier about it is you’ve never been in a scenario where you shut down the entire economy,” said Steve Chiavarone, a portfolio manager with Federated Investors. “You get a sense in your stomach that we don’t know how to price this and that markets could fall more.
The Federal Reserve and other central banks have dramatically stepped up efforts to stabilize capital markets and liquidity, yet the moves have so far failed to boost sentiment or improve the rapidly deteriorating global economic outlook. An International Monetary Fund pledge to mobilize its $1 trillion lending capacity also had little impact in markets.
Investors continue to clamor for massive spending packages by governments around the world to offset the pain from closures of schools, restaurants, cinemas and sporting events. Companies around the world have scaled back activity to accommodate government demands to limit social interaction.

Investing.com - European stock markets are set to open higher Tuesday, rebounding from Monday’s sharp losses, helped by more central bank largesse and promises of action from the G7 and the Eurogroup. However, these gains are likely to be hard won as the pandemic forces investors to face the possibility of several months of declining economic activity. 
At 03:23 AM ET (0723 GMT), the DAX futures contract traded 435 points, or 5.1% higher. {{167|France's CAC 40 futures were up 101 points, or 2.6%, while the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. rose 129 points, or 2.5%. Futures on the pan-eurozone index, the Euro Stoxx 50, climbed 119 points, or 5.1%. 
Earlier Tuesday, the Bank of Japan pumped more than $30 billion into markets with an 84-day dollar funding operation. This move came after the world's six major central banks took a joint step to provide more cash dollars on Sunday as a rout in financial markets over the past week led to a scramble by banks and companies for dollar liquidity. In addition, the U.S. Federal Reserve cut short-term rates to near zero while pledging hundreds of billions of dollars in asset purchases.
Tuesday’s bounce follows hefty losses in Europe, while the Dow suffered its biggest one-day plunge ever on Monday, falling almost 3,000 points, after President Donald Trump said the worst of the outbreak could last through the summer and that it was not currently under control.
With governments in the United States and Europe closing borders, shutting restaurants and bars, closing schools and calling on citizens to stay home, it’s clear economic activity is going to take a severe hit during this process. 
After all, the latest figures showed Chinese industrial output dropped 13.5% on the year in January and February, while retail sales fell 20.5%.
These numbers have prompted Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) to cut its estimate for China's first quarter gross domestic product to a year-on-year contraction of 9% from a previous forecast of 2.5% growth.
Talking of economic indicators, the U.K. unemployment numbers for January are due at 0530 AM ET (0930 GMT), but these figures have largely been made outdated by events. However, the German ZEW economic sentiment release for March, at 0600 AM ET, will be of interest as a gauge of the mood among the country’s investors as the coronavirus pandemic takes hold.
Oil markets have pushed back above the $30 a barrel level Tuesday, helped by the prospect of U.S. and other countries filling strategic storage. That said, it’s debatable how long this will support prices given the major hit to demand and the sharp increase in supply resulting from the collapse of the OPEC+ output restraint pact. 
AT 03:23 AM ET (0723 GMT), U.S. crude futures traded 5.1% higher at $30.48 a barrel and the international benchmark Brent contract rose 3.2% to $31.02. 
Additionally, gold futures rose 0.1% to $1,488.40/oz, while EUR/USD traded at 1.1146, down 0.3% on the day.

1239,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 17, 2020 03:06AM ET</span>","In virus-hit China, open a bank account, get free masks","By Engen Tham and Cheng Leng
SHANGHAI/BEIJING (Reuters) - China's banks, aiming to kick start business after the coronavirus outbreak prompted a nationwide shutdown, have found a novel way to lure customers: free masks.
Economic activity is starting to get into gear, after a period in which the government cut transport links and locked down cities at the end of January to slow the spread of the contagious virus responsible for over 3,000 deaths in the country.
As the number of new virus cases fell, lenders found themselves between policy initiatives to lend to virus-stricken firms, and the prospect of sour debt as companies struggled.
To lure much-needed custom, banks across the country have started to offer the hottest commodity in town - masks, popularly believed as helping prevent contagion - to new customers for everything from signing up to an app to opening a deposit account.
Though the government has declared the peak of the virus has passed, in some areas masks and disinfectant are still in short supply as cities continue to bar those without masks from entering public places.
At China Everbright Bank Co Ltd (SS:601818), customers who link their debit or credit cards to their WeChat pay accounts and transfer 0.01 yuan ($0.0014) will be entitled to five masks.
""Everyone is very enthusiastic, it's hot"" said Liu Huan, a person managing the offer at the bank.
THE BIG GIVEAWAY
At one branch of the Bank of Wuhai in northern Inner Mongolia, customers receive free masks if they sign up for fixed-term deposits of over 10,000 yuan ($1,428.78) or buy 50,000 yuan worth of wealth management products, among other offerings, showed a post on the lender's WeChat account.
The Hunan Hengdong Rural Commercial Bank said in late February it would give customers who made deposits masks, disinfectant and alcohol wipes.
Last week, Zhejiang Mintai Commercial Bank said it would give masks to those aged over 50 who signed up to their app.
Even Panzhou Wanhe Country Bank, a rural lender with just five branches in remote Liupanshui in Guizhou province, began giving out two free masks to anyone opening accounts from March 6.
In a more creative giveaway, in the coastal city of Qingdao, local branches of the state-owned  Postal Savings Bank of China Co Ltd  (HK:1658) had 100 masks a day up for grabs, which could be won by mobile clients entering a lottery.
Before the outbreak, China's banks were already under pressure as loan prime rate reform shaved margins and the U.S.-Sino trade war deterred borrowing in the manufacturing.
On Monday, China's economic indicators plunged to historic lows, evidence that the impact of the virus may be far worse than widely expected and is likely to weigh further on already struggling banks.
While insurers are faring better, many are also dangling free masks and other necessities as incentives.
In Shangahi, managers at the giant Ping An Insurance Group Co of China Ltd (SS:601318) (HK:2318) have been giving away masks, sanitizer and alcohol spray to clients since late-February, according to social media posts.
Their marketing phrase: ""Masks give you one-off protection, but insurance protection is for life."""
1240,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 17, 2020 02:49AM ET</span>","Amazon to hire 100,000 workers as online orders surge on coronavirus worries","(Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) on Monday said it would hire 100,000 warehouse and delivery workers in the United States to deal with a surge in online orders, as many consumers have turned to the web to meet their needs during the coronavirus outbreak.
With shoppers clearing out shelves in fear of quarantines or product shortages, retailers are racing to keep food and hygienic items in stock and have employees on hand for in-store work or delivery.
Like Amazon, U.S. supermarket chains Albertsons, Kroger (N:KR) and Raley's have sought new hires to staff busy sections and fulfill online orders. They are turning to people in the restaurant, travel and entertainment businesses who are suddenly looking for work because of the coronavirus.
""We want those people to know we welcome them on our teams until things return to normal and their past employer is able to bring them back,"" Amazon said in a blog post https://blog.aboutamazon.com/operations/amazon-opening-100000-new-roles.
Major shipper  United Parcel  Service Inc (N:UPS) said its trucking and air deliveries were still on despite growing government restrictions on commercial activities. It said Monday it was meeting demand with its existing workforce.
The coronavirus, which has led to more than 7,100 deaths globally and prompted mass lockdowns of people, has also led to items being out of stock on Amazon and some deliveries taking longer than usual.
Amazon's headcount fluctuates seasonally, recently peaking for the holiday quarter at 798,000 full and part-time workers. It was not immediately clear how many people Amazon would employ after it hires 100,000 more.
To draw new employees, Amazon said it would add $2 to its minimum $15 per hour to U.S. workers' wages through April. The extra pay for hourly employees in North America and Europe is expected to cost more than $350 million, Amazon said.
Meanwhile, other retailers facing long queues are making pitches for talent, too.
It was not clear if there would be any impact on delivery operations from new government restrictions. In the San Francisco Bay Area on Monday, officials said people must stay at home except for some essential purposes, such as work for ""businesses that ship or deliver groceries, food, goods or services directly to residences.""

An Amazon spokeswoman did not immediately return a request for comment on the San Francisco order.

Investing.com - Qantas Airways Ltd (ASX:QAN) said on Tuesday that it is cutting its international capacity by about 90% until at least the end of May as the coronavirus outbreak continued to worsen.
 
The slash in international flights was up from a 23% reduction announced last week. It was the airline’s fourth round of reductions in less than a month. Domestic capacity will also be cut by around 60%, the company said. 
 
Qantas added that it had suffered a “precipitous decline in demand” and any rebound could be months away.
 
Sydney-based consultancy CAPA Centre for Aviation warned in a statement this week that the virus pandemic could potentially bankrupt most airlines globally by the end of May if governments and authorities do not take coordinated steps to avoid such a situation. 
 
“Coordinated government and industry action is needed — now — if catastrophe is to be avoided,” CAPA said. Otherwise, “emerging from the crisis will be like entering a brutal battlefield, littered with casualties,” it said.
Qantas’s shares were down 5.3% to AUD 2.86 by 1:53 AM ET (05:53 GMT). The stock has lost 60% this year.

The 50-member Hang Seng Index now trades at 99% of book value, a level only seen twice before in data compiled by Bloomberg going back to 1993. That means traders are pricing firms’ assets at less than than their stated worth, something that last happened in 2016. The gauge last week entered its second bear market in as many years.
The prospect that the virus outbreak may send the global economy into recession is adding to the fragile sentiment in Hong Kong, where the economy was already on a downturn due to last year’s protests. The city’s stock market may also be paying the price for being highly liquid and widely owned, making it vulnerable to volatility shocks in the U.S. or Europe.
“It’s not just the global stock crash that’s worrying investors now, but a global economic recession,” said Castor Pang, head of research at Core Pacific-Yamaichi International Hong Kong. “The market will remain super volatile in Hong Kong - the outlook is so uncertain.”
After a 4% slump to start the week, the Hang Seng Index was relatively steady Tuesday as U.S. stock-index futures jumped. Investors in Hong Kong have been boosting their hedges and preparing for further losses, with short selling on Monday accounting for about 18% of total turnover on Hong Kong’s main board. That’s the highest proportion in more than six months.
About half of the companies listed on the Hang Seng Index trade below book value, with Swire Pacific Ltd. -- which controls embattled airline Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd. -- the cheapest with a ratio of just 0.31. Internet giant Tencent Holdings Ltd. remain expensive with a price-to-book ratio of almost 7.3, though that’s still down from a February high of 8.9.
In 2016, Hong Kong stocks fell below the value of their net assets amid concerns over capital outflows and China’s economic slowdown. But reaching the milestone could also signal that the worst may soon be over for Hong Kong: when it happened in 2016, the index went on to rally about 80% in two years.
The Hang Seng measure’s relative-strength index remained below 30 for a fourth day Tuesday, a signal that selling may have gone too far and too fast.
“It suggests that the Hang Seng Index is close to bottoming,” said Daniel So, a strategist at CMB International Securities Ltd. “The price-to-book ratio at crisis levels tells a lot about how cheap stocks are right now.”"
1246,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 17, 2020 01:29AM ET</span>",Depositors Staying Put Is Key to India’s Biggest Bank Rescue,"(Bloomberg) -- Depositors will judge this week whether India has staved off another threat to banking sector stability when curbs on withdrawals from a recently-seized private lender are lifted.
Yes Bank Ltd.’s share price has more than doubled since the authorities late Friday implemented a one-of-a-kind rescue plan that saw eight state-backed and other lenders pledge capital infusions. Most of Yes Bank’s stock can’t be sold for at least three years and the Reserve Bank of India has pledged more liquidity if needed to restore confidence in what till recently was India’s fourth-biggest private bank.
Results over the weekend showed how dire the situation had become. Yes Bank reported nearly a fifth of its loan book had turned bad and deposits shrank 34% in just over five months. Provisioning for soured debt eroded the bank’s core capital ratio to 0.6% in the three months ended December, well below a regulatory minimum.
Now it’s left for depositors to decide whether they believe a rescue led by State Bank of India, the nation’s largest lender, will be enough to stem the rot when restrictions on withdrawals end Wednesday. Twenty months into a shadow lending crisis that has now claimed a large bank, confidence in India’s financial system is fragile. Yes Bank’s recent “deposit flight” is a cause for concern, according to Fitch Ratings.
“If the depositors are not convinced about the resolution put in place then the risk of a flight to safety is high,” said Saswata Guha, director and team head of financial institutions at Fitch Ratings. “Yes Bank would be vulnerable in that scenario, but the contagion could spread to other banks as well.”
A lack of liquidity was cited as a key reason for Yes Bank’s bailout. State Bank of India, ICICI Bank Ltd. and HDFC Ltd. are among the institutions that have said they will buy stakes in the lender since it was seized.
However, Yes might need more capital to meet the minimum regulatory norms, Fitch’s Guha said, adding that the latest round will raise the ratio by 350 basis points.
To ensure the stability of its share price -- which has tanked more than 80% in the past year -- the regulator has mandated that investors who hold more than 100 shares cannot sell 75% of their holding for at least three years. Yes Bank shares rose as much as 50% in Mumbai on Tuesday after a 46% surge Monday.
Moody’s Investors Service late on Monday upgraded the bank’s ratings with a positive outlook but expects that Yes Bank will continue to require liquidity assistance and forbearance from the RBI immediately after the curbs are lifted.
The rescue is as much a test for India’s financial sector, which has suffered a series of shocks since the outbreak of a shadow banking crisis in late 2018. Policy makers have previously been forced to seize systemically-important Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services Ltd., followed by housing finance lender Dewan Housing Finance Corp. and a local small lender to ring-fence their collapse.
On Monday, RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das reiterated depositors’ money was safe and urged them not to withdraw in panic once the curbs are lifted. On numerous occasions in the past six months, the central bank has taken to Twitter to reassure a rattled public about safety of their deposits.
The last thing Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s administration wants is a contagion from Yes Bank’s closure and its resultant impact on an economy that’s already expanding at its slowest pace in over a decade.
Banks including South Indian Bank Ltd. and Karnataka Bank Ltd. are among lenders that are at higher risk for reasons including their weaker capital buffers and lower provisions for loans, according to a note by Yuvraj Choudhary, an analyst at Anand Rathi Research. Meanwhile, Federal Bank Ltd. and RBL Bank Ltd. have had to issue statements to refute speculation about weaknesses in their balance sheets.
“There are lot of weak banks,” said Gaurang Shah, vice president at Geojit Financial Services. “I hope they get merged and regulators do a detailed scrutiny before they fail.”

1247,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 17, 2020 01:09AM ET</span>",'D' word rears head as coronavirus-hit markets brace for recession,"By Lewis Krauskopf
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The coronavirus shockwaves rippling through U.S. stocks are forcing investors to contemplate outcomes more dire than a recession, including several quarters of declining economic activity, a credit crisis or even a depression.
The rising global toll from the pandemic and the uncertainty over how far it may spread has left investors and economists scrambling to gauge the financial fallout.
""This market looks like it has already priced in most of a garden variety recession,"" said Frances Donald, global chief economist at Manulife Investment Management. ""It is now on top of that having to price in some probability of a credit crisis.""
Forecasters at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and other banks are now projecting a steep economic contraction in at least the second quarter as governments in the United States and Europe start shutting restaurants, closing schools and calling on citizens to stay home.
But there is hope among some economists that economy will start expanding again later this year -- depending in part on efforts to contain the virus, known as Covid-19.
The S&P 500 on average has fallen 28% from peak to trough during recessions, according to an analysis of the past 70 years from Keith Lerner, chief market strategist at Truist/SunTrust Advisory Services. As of Monday's close, the benchmark index had declined 29.5% from its Feb. 19 closing record high.
But the market's plunge was much deeper over a decade ago during the financial crisis, with the S&P 500 tumbling more than 50%.
""A 2008-like financial contagion is not yet priced into this market,"" Donald said, but she added the market ""probably won’t have any reassurance that we have avoided that 2008-type scenario completely until we see a calming of credit spreads and the pace of Covid-19 cases starts to decline.”
Stocks crumbled anew on Monday a day after the Federal Reserve took emergency action designed to cushion the economy, using tools similar to those the central bank deployed to help the country emerge from the 2007-2009 financial crisis.
The market's reaction on Monday after the Fed's ""drastic action"" is ""a sign of a total breakdown of confidence,"" said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities. ""That’s raising the question of how steep of a recession are we going to endure.""
PROLONGED SLUMP?
Joachim Fels, PIMCO's global economic advisor, said in a written commentary that a global recession appeared to be a ""foregone conclusion"" and that the task for governments and central banks was to ensure that the recession ""stays relatively short-lived and doesn’t morph into an economic depression.""
Fels loosely defined a depression as ""a combination of a prolonged slump of activity that last longer than just a few quarters, a very significantly rise in unemployment, and mass business bankruptcies and bank failures.""
Data out of China, where the pathogen originated late last year, underscored just how much economic damage the disease had already done with industrial output plunging 13.5% and retail sales 20.5%.
At least one other big Wall Street name appears concerned that the current crisis could snowball into something bigger than a recession.
Billionaire investor Ray Dalio, whose main Bridgewater Associates LP hedge fund fell sharply amid the coronavirus-led market rout, is worried that the Fed and other central banks may have already expended a good deal of their firepower by cutting rates to near zero.
In a note on Monday, Dalio said he had been concerned that the next economic downturn would ""lead to hitting the 0% interest rate floor with a lot of debt outstanding and big wealth and political gaps in the same way that configuration of events happened in the 1930s.""
Strategists at  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) said in a note last week that the market's recent volatility, marked by the swings of over 3% in the S&P 500, was coming at ""a frequency previously seen only in the Great Financial Crisis and the Great Depression.""
Following the Fed's action, Wall Street's focus is now on what fiscal policies governments will enact, and even more so, on what can be done to contain the virus.
""Nothing else matters if we can’t get this under control,” said Eric Winograd, chief U.S. economist at AllianceBernstein.
The market's pullback has taken the S&P 500 down to the level it was last at in late 2018 and mid-2017.
""I don’t think it is quite pricing in a prolonged depression scenario at this stage and I think it is probably appropriate not to,"" Winograd said. ""That's not the base case.""
However, Winograd said he was concerned the situation could turn into a ""durable recession"" that stems in part from distress in the banking sector.
""If we end up in a multiple-quarter level decline, I would expect there still to be significant downside for the market.”"

The department store operator said it would close its stores for two weeks starting March 17, while keeping its apps and websites open, including Nordstrom.com, Nordstromrack.com, HauteLook.com. The company said it would provide pay and benefits for store employees during the period.
Seattle-based Nordstrom operates 380 stores in 40 states, including 116 full-line stores and 248 off-price Nordstrom Rack stores.
The company also suspended its share buyback program as part of a plan to further cut its expenses and withdrew its 2020 outlook.
""While February sales were in line with expectations, the company experienced a broad-based deceleration in customer demand over the past couple of weeks, particularly in markets most affected by the virus,"" Nordstrom said in a statement.
Nordstrom, like other brick-and-mortar retailers, has struggled to deal with disruptions caused by a rise in cases of the respiratory illness in the United States, particularly in its key markets, such as Seattle, New York City and Los Angeles.
The Seattle area has been at the center of the outbreak in the United States, with Washington State reporting about 904 confirmed cases of the virus and 48 deaths as of Monday.
New York City and Los Angeles ordered restaurants, theaters, bars and movie houses to close, as cities across the country attempt to check the spread of the coronavirus.
Nordstrom opened its flagship store in New York last year in a bid to attract new customers with a suite of services including cafes, fine-dining restaurants and a full bar.
Several other retailer, including Casper Inc (N:CSPR) and  Guess? Inc  (N:GES), said they would be closing all their retail stores in the coming days, assuring that their employees would receive pay and benefits.

The United States has seen a sharp increase in virus cases, with more than 4,300 infected and at least 80 people dead, according to Johns Hopkins University and public health agencies.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi passed virus legislation early Saturday. Federal Reserve Chairman Jay Powell slashed interest rates close to zero Sunday. And on Monday, a subdued Trump took to the White House podium to say of the coronavirus: “It’s bad.”
He endorsed “social distancing” -- the stay-at-home behaviors that many Americans, their employers, state leaders and mayors had been promoting and practicing for days.
On Sunday, he told people to go to grocery stores, but to refrain from buying so much. By Monday, he was telling them to stay out of restaurants and educate their children at home.
Trump had taken some steps before Monday. He created a White House coronavirus task force, gave a prime-time speech where he announced sweeping new restrictions on travel from Europe and said he had changed federal rules to make more virus tests available -- amid complaints of a shortage.
It’s just that many other countries and some American governors moved faster than the president.
Only on Monday, after the number of U.S. cases exceeded 4,000 and the stock market plunged another 12.9 percentage points, did Trump suddenly execute a heel-turn, acknowledging that the outbreak is so severe it may even drive the economy into recession.
Trump has spent weeks minimizing the impact of the coronavirus outbreak and urging Americans to stay calm, while state and local leaders who regard the disease as a dire threat have taken the initiative in the nation’s response.
Some states shuttered bars, theaters and restaurants and banned large gatherings before Trump reversed his tone on Monday -- after complaining about a lack of federal direction.
Governors of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut said in a joint statement that they were imposing restrictions “amid a lack of federal direction and nationwide standards.”
“If the federal government doesn’t step up quickly, states are going to be forced to do stuff on their own,” said New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat.
Trump and Vice President Mike Pence held a call with governors on Monday in which they talked about ways to “flatten the curve” of new cases.
Trump has approached the virus like many other crises during his presidency: By saying he’s done a perfect job and blaming Democrats for any failings. Trump even faulted former President Barack Obama for the lack of available tests.
Trump’s actions on the virus so far haven’t calmed markets or satisfied governors struggling to contain the largest outbreaks. Stocks plunged while Trump was addressing reporters at the White House on Monday, and ultimately dropped the most since 1987.
“This is bad in the sense that it’s so contagious,” the president told reporters on Monday, “It’s just so contagious, sort of record-setting type contagion.”
The U.S. may still be fighting the outbreak until August or later, he added.
Asked why the U.S. sharply cut its recommended maximum size for gathering on Monday from a day earlier, Trump’s virus response coordinator, Deborah Birx, said it was because government modeling changed and stressed the need for social distancing.
“We had new information coming out from a model, and what had the biggest impact in the model is social distancing,” including families self-quarantining for 14 days if a single family member has the virus, she said.
The administration has been examining options to help businesses affected by the virus. In particular, Trump said he’s looking at ways to help U.S. airlines as demand has dropped sharply. A final proposal hasn’t been drafted, people familiar with the matter said. The industry wants as much as $58 billion in grants and loans.
The White House is also considering how to help hotels, restaurants and businesses focused on recreational activities, two people familiar with the matter said.
“The United States will be powerfully supporting those industries, like Airlines and others, that are particularly affected by the Chinese Virus,” Trump said in a tweet.
On Monday, Trump hosted a call with fellow Group of Seven leaders -- at the insistence of France’s Emmanuel Macron and Germany’s Angela Merkel, who had been blindsided last week when the U.S. president closed his country to most European travelers.
Leaders of the G-7 said they will do “whatever is necessary” to ensure a globally coordinated response to the coronavirus pandemic and its economic fallout. The leaders said they would marshal the full power of their governments to coordinate public health measures, restore confidence in the economy, support global trade and investment, and encourage cooperation in scientific research.
Trump hailed the cooperation of the G-7, comprised of leaders who have issued more dire warnings than Trump. Merkel’s government shuttered a range of businesses across Germany. U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson urged British citizens to end all non-essential contact. Italy is on lockdown to cope with a surging outbreak.
Medical specialists said the U.S. should have taken similar steps weeks ago to prevent the outbreak from worsening."

1252,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 16, 2020 10:36PM ET</span>",Large U.S. banks plan to access Fed's discount window,"By Pete Schroeder and Elizabeth Dilts Marshall
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The eight largest U.S. banks said on Monday that they would be jointly access funding from the Federal Reserve's so-called ""discount window.""
The banks said that while they are strong and well-capitalized, the move is aimed at reducing the stigma attached to that low-interest emergency funding tool, after banks shied away from it following the 2008 financial crisis.
The joint move was announced by their trade group the Financial Services Forum, in a statement.
The banks include Bank of America Corp (N:BAC), Bank of New York Mellon Corp (N:BK),  Citigroup  Inc (N:C),  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS),  JP Morgan Chase  & Co (N:JPM),  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS),  State Street  Corp (N:STT), and  Wells Fargo  & Co (N:WFC).
Regulators had urged banks to reconsider accessing low-cost funds through the window this week, saying that the government stood ready to help banks meet demands for credit amid financial market turmoil sparked by the coronavirus pandemic.
To further entice banks, the Fed announced Sunday it would lower the rate on the emergency lending window and allow banks to borrow from the Fed for longer.
Banks had effectively abandoned the discount window following the 2008 financial crisis, over concerns that turning to the Fed for liquidity could be interpreted by the market as a sign of weakness.
The stigma attached to using the discount window has existed for more than 70 years and was exacerbated by the financial crisis, but the joint decision of the eight banks will likely help make it a more acceptable tool for other banks.
""While Forum member institutions individually have substantial liquidity and multiple sources of funding, they believe it is important to lead by demonstrating the value of the Federal Reserve’s discount window facility and to encourage its use by other financial institutions,"" the group said in a joint statement.
JPMorgan Chase & Co, the largest U.S. bank by assets, said in February that it had decided it can hold less cash for its resolution plan, and instead, factor in the possibility of using the discount window."
1253,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 16, 2020 10:33PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Shale gas pioneer Chesapeake Energy taps restructuring advisers - sources,"By Mike Spector, David French and Jessica DiNapoli
(Reuters) - Chesapeake Energy Corp (NYSE:CHK), the oil and gas exploration and production company that helped spearhead the U.S. shale revolution, has tapped debt restructuring advisers amid a rout in energy prices, people familiar with the matter said on Monday.
The Oklahoma City-based company, which was co-founded by late wildcatter Aubrey McClendon, was struggling with its debt pile of roughly $9 billion even before an oil price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia and the fallout from the coronavirus pandemic contributed to driving its shares down more than 50% in the last three weeks.
Chesapeake has enlisted restructuring lawyers at Kirkland & Ellis LLP and investment bankers at Rothschild & Co who specialize in reworking debt, the four sources said. The company is studying its options and no debt restructuring move is imminent, the sources added, asking not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential.
Chesapeake, Kirkland and Rothschild had no immediate comment. 
The advisers Chesapeake has enlisted have counseled on significant restructurings of large energy companies, including utility Energy Future Holdings Corp, the record $45 billion leveraged buyout that collapsed in 2014. Since 2018, Rothschild has partnered with Intrepid Financial Partners, a firm co-founded by former senior  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Plc executive Hugh ""Skip"" McGee, when advising oil and gas firms. Intrepid did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
Chesapeake has already been making moves to secure more financial breathing space. It has refinanced debt, exchanged existing liabilities for new ones that mature later, and created new liens within its debt structure. 
The company said in January it had cut debt by $900 million, and in February added it had ample liquidity of about $1.4 billion to address looming debt maturities. 
Nevertheless, those pronouncements preceded significant worldwide market turmoil and economic uncertainty stemming from the coronavirus crisis, as well as a recent plunge in oil prices. The developments have pressured oil and gas producers across the board, and prompted Chesapeake to take yet another hard look at its financial books. 
Chesapeake shares are down 75% so far this year and were off more than 30% on Monday, giving it a market capitalization of just under $400 million. 
The company has said it is pursuing a reverse stock split to avoid being delisted from the New York Stock Exchange. 
Its 11.5% bonds due in 2025, issued in December as part of a broader reworking of its liabilities, are trading around 14 cents on the dollar, giving a presumptive yield of 94.4%, according to Refinitiv Eikon data.
Chesapeake was founded in 1989 and was one of the pioneers of the production of shale gas. It has been pivoting to generate more oil, growing production 30% year-over-year in 2019, according to a February investor presentation.

Chesapeake has operations in five U.S. states, including Pennsylvania, Texas and Louisiana.

1254,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 16, 2020 09:26PM ET</span>",Boeing in talks for short-term U.S. government assistance,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -  Boeing Co  (N:BA) confirmed it is in talks with senior White House officials and congressional leaders about short-term assistance for itself and the entire aviation sector.
Boeing, already struggling to win approval from regulators for its 737 MAX to return to service after two fatal crashes in five months, is in talks with the U.S. government to try to win support for manufacturers, suppliers, airlines and airports, the person said. 
This discussions come on a day the planemaker saw its stock plummet 24% to $129.61, and is off more than 60% over the last month as the coronavirus pandemic slashed travel demand worldwide. Earlier on Monday, S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) downgraded Boeing's credit rating and lowered its free cash flow expectations for the company.
The Boeing talks for short-term government aid were reported earlier by Bloomberg News, and later confirmed by a source familiar with the situation to Reuters.
Boeing said late Monday that ready short-term access to public and private liquidity will be one of ""the most important ways"" for airlines, airports, suppliers and manufacturers to recover. ""We appreciate how the administration and Congress are engaging with all elements of the aviation industry during this difficult time,"" is added.
Boeing said it is ""taking steps to manage the pressure on our business. We’re leveraging all our resources to sustain our operations.""
U.S. airlines and cargo carriers have said they are seeking at least $58 billion in loans and grants along with additional tax changes, while airports have sought $10 billion. 
Boeing declined to say how much in assistance it was seeking or in what form it might take, but added the entire U.S. aerospace industry that ""supports over 2.5 million jobs and 17,000 suppliers – is facing an urgent challenge resulting from the coronavirus pandemic.""
U.S. President Donald Trump, in a tweet late Monday, wrote ""the United States will be powerfully supporting those industries, like Airlines and others, that are particularly affected"" by the coronavirus. A White House official confirmed the talks ""to discuss their views generally just as we have with others.""
Boeing and airlines are making the case that they need quick assistance and hope that there will be action in days, the person familiar with the talks and airline officials said. 
Reuters reported Wednesday that Boeing was planning to draw down the rest of a $13.8 billion loan it agreed last month.
Boeing’s total debt nearly doubled to $27.3 billion in 2019, as it compensated airlines and grappled with additional production costs for the 737 MAX even as the grounding prevented it from delivering the aircraft to buyers.
Last week, Boeing said it was freezing new hiring and overtime except in certain critical areas to preserve cash, the U.S. planemaker’s chief executive.
Boeing Chief Executive Dave Calhoun told employees on Wednesday the company was taking steps to address the business pressures that result from “the pain our customers and suppliers are feeling"" and added that layoffs or furloughs were also a “real possibility.""
Airlines are slashing flights and it raises questions about whether they will cancel orders for the MAX, which has been grounded for just over a year. 

Boeing idled production of the MAX in January and has said it hopes to win approval for return to service in mid-2020.

1255,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 16, 2020 09:21PM ET</span>","As panic selloff grips investors, their kids need lunch","By Noel Randewich
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - As Wall Street suffered its worst one-day rout in three decades on Monday, financial professionals managed the historic selloff with the added distraction of children needing lunch and dogs barking to be let out.
The S&P 500 tumbled 12% in its worst one-day drop since October 1987, just as growing numbers of investors began to work from home to slow the spread of the coronavirus that is already widely expected to throw the U.S. economy into a downturn.
Investors juggled emergency conference calls with domestic duties as schools across the country closed to avoid spreading the virus.
Goldman Sachs (N:GS) and  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS) announced programs last week for working remotely to stem the spread of the disease. Several banks have banned travel and taken other measures after cases of coronavirus were detected at firms including  Barclays  (L:BARC), BlackRock Inc (N:BLK),  Citigroup  Inc (N:C) and JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM).
Trip Miller, a managing partner of Gullane Capital Partners, spent much of the day at his dining room table in Memphis, Tennessee, where he talked, emailed and texted with colleagues and investors as they monitored the rapid selloff and their portfolio of about 16 long positions and a similar number of shorts.
""Meanwhile, I had a four-year-old and a seven-year-old asking me to cut their pizza,"" Miller joked, adding he does not expect the market to improve until the coronavirus outbreak shows signs of containment.
The latest tumble on the U.S. stock market was despite the Federal Reserve's surprise move late Sunday to cut interest rates to near zero, its second emergency cut in less than two weeks as it struggles to defend the longest U.S. economic expansion on record, now in its 11th year.
""We are in full panic mode. Until comfort returns, panic kind of dies down, I think we are going to continue to have big moves,"" warned Jim Paulsen, chief financial strategist at the Leuthold Group in Minneapolis.
Monday's historic drop followed a 9.3% surge on Friday and a 9.5% plunge on Thursday. Overall, the S&P 500 has plummeted nearly 30% from its record high on Feb. 19, and many investors are reluctant to predict when the selling will end.
Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial (NYSE:PRU) in Newark, New Jersey, said that while she often works from home she missed being among her colleagues during Monday's market carnage.
""In all the downturns I've experienced, there has always been something comforting about being physically there with your colleagues, commiserating and coming up with a solution,"" Krosby said. ""You can’t make that artificially, it has to be real.""
Lance Pan, director of investment research and strategy at Capital Advisors Group in Newton, Mass, said the Fed was right to take decisive action, even if the market appeared unimpressed. He added that working from home may also be hampering some investors.
""Traders, even though they talk to each other, they may not see the body language. They have kids with them. I definitely think working from home, the isolation factor, does play into market liquidity,"" Pan said.
Cresset Wealth Advisors Chief Investment Officer Jack Ablin, in Palm Beach, Florida, spent much of the day looking into what to eventually buy, once the market stabilizes.
""My team was on calls for about four hours today and the only hardship was hearing dogs barking in the background,"" Ablin said."
1256,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 16, 2020 07:45PM ET</span>",Another black Monday as coronavirus response upends Wall Street,"By Caroline Valetkevitch
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street suffered its biggest drop since the crash of 1987 on Monday after unprecedented steps taken by the Federal Reserve, lawmakers and the White House to slow the spread and blunt the economic hit of the coronavirus failed to restore order to markets.
The S&P 500 tumbled 12%, closing at its lowest level since December 2018, despite the Fed's surprise move late Sunday to cut interest rates to near zero, its second emergency rate cut in less than two weeks and ahead of a scheduled policy meeting on Tuesday and Wednesday.
It was the third-largest daily percentage drop on record, beaten only by the 1987 ""Black Monday"" rout and the crash of October 1929.
That heightened alarm about the rapid spread of the pandemic and how it has paralyzed parts of the global economy and squeezed company revenue.
Investors appear increasingly worried about how effectively policymakers will be able to mitigate the economic damage from the spreading virus.
Stocks fell further late in the session as President Donald Trump urged Americans to halt most social activities for 15 days and not congregate in groups larger than 10 people, in a bold, new effort to reduce the spread of the coronavirus in the United States.
""There's nothing that can really give us a sense of when the full extent of the virus' impact will be known,"" said Jeffrey Kleintop, chief global investment strategist at  Charles Schwab  (NYSE:SCHW).
Trump also said the United States may be heading into a recession.
Most market watchers at this point are bracing for the likelihood that the economy is headed for a recession, but they said it is too early to know the full extent of the economic downturn.
Investors also are not yet convinced that all the rushed, panicked responses are gaining traction.
Bars, restaurants, theaters and movie houses in New York and Los Angeles were ordered shut, and U.S. states pleaded with the Trump administration to coordinate a national response to the outbreak.
 Nike  Inc (N:NKE),  Under Armour  Inc (N:UAA) and others said they would close stores in the United States and some other markets.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) fell 2,997.1 points, or 12.93%, to 20,188.52, the S&P 500 (SPX) lost 324.89 points, or 11.98%, to 2,386.13. The Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) dropped 970.28 points, or 12.32%, to 6,904.59.
The S&P 500 lost $2.69 trillion in market capitalization for the day, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices, and the index is down 29.5% from its record high close on Feb. 19 and has lost$8.28 trillion in that time, based on S&P Dow Jones data.
Trading on Wall Street's three main stock indexes was halted for 15 minutes shortly after the open as the S&P 500 index (SPX) plunged 8%, crossing the 7% threshold that triggers an automatic cutout.
The real estate sector was the weakest out of the S&P 500's 11 major sectors with a 16.5% dive, which was its deepest one-day percentage drop since 2009. The smallest loser was consumer staples (SPLRCS) which sank 7% on the day.
The technology sector (SPLRCT) fell 13.9%, which was a record one-day decline for the sector that was the biggest driver of the bull market.
The Cboe Volatility Index (VIX), known as ""Wall Street's fear gauge,"" ended the session at 82.69, its highest ever closing level.
Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at the Leuthold Group in Minneapolis, speaking of the VIX, said the market was in ""full panic mode.""
""Until comfort returns, panic kind of dies down, I think we are going to continue to have big moves,"" he said.
Despite the intense volatility, the markets should stay open, the head of the U.S. securities regulator said, quashing speculation that the government might shut down the country's exchanges to stop the plunge in stock prices.
Lance Pan, director of investment research and strategy at Capital Advisors group in Newton Massachusetts, said that he was trying to calm clients on Monday and noted the extra problems people were having from working from home.
""We're flying blind and traders, even though they talk to each other, they may not see the body language, they have kids with them,"" he said.
Some 16.37 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges compared with the 13.51 billion average for the last 20 sessions.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 14.68-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 11.64-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
The S&P 500 posted no new 52-week highs and 341 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded three new highs and 1,477 new lows."

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - U.S. delivery companies are halting ""white glove"" in-home delivery and set-up of TVs, sofas and exercise equipment in a handful of cities to limit contact with customers in an effort to help contain the spread of coronavirus and protect drivers.
Chicago-based SEKO has halted ""over the threshold"" service in Seattle, Spokane, Portland and San Francisco, Brian Bourke, SEKO's chief growth officer, told Reuters.
The company is now calling every in-home delivery customer and giving them the option to delay, reschedule, or have items left on porches or in garages. Drivers also can decline to enter a home if they feel it is unsafe, Bourke said.
""The delivery experience is going to be different for the foreseeable future,"" said Bourke, who is watching outbreak trends closely.
Transportation companies are moving to protect truck and delivery drivers, who are vital to keeping food, medical supplies and e-commerce moving as people in the United States begin sheltering at home in an effort to slow an expected wave of cases of COVID-19, the respiratory illness caused by the sometimes deadly new coronavirus.
""They are on the front lines,"" Bourke said of transportation workers.
Rival XPO also stopped in-home deliveries in quarantine areas in the United States, company spokeswoman Erin Kurtz said.
Transportation and delivery companies are scrambling to respond to demand shifts wrought by the fast-spreading virus, which has killed more than 7,000 globally, including at least 74 people in the United States.
SEKO has begun identifying space in warehouses that could be used to stage medical devices, hospital beds, masks and other supplies for quick deployment to outbreak hotspots.
""Hospitals don't have warehouses attached to them,"" Bourke said.
California-based Pyramid Logistics, which provides transportation and services for events, on Monday put out a call to companies whose suppliers are suddenly overbooked.
""As we have seen trade shows pause temporarily, we are restructuring our trucking and transportation services to assist corporations in need,"" Pyramid principal Rob Dissman said in a statement.
 United Parcel  Service Inc (N:UPS), the world's biggest package delivery firm, is working with federal, state and local governments to keep its trucks - and planes - running throughout the outbreak.
""We ... have been granted permission to continue operating, even in cities or communities where there are border closures or enforced restrictions on commercial activities,"" UPS spokesman Glenn Zaccara said."

Investing.com - Strong selling into the close left Wall Street with another day of historic losses, with the Dow down nearly 3,000 points, or 12.93%, the second-biggest percentage drop in history, eclipsing the crash of 1929.
President Donald Trump said the Covid-19 outbreak could last through August and could cause a recession, which prompted investors to head to the exits.
Stocks will continue to be in the grip of any virus headlines.
Here are three things that could move the markets tomorrow.
1. FedEx Global Commentary Will Be Key
Although earnings have been on the back burner, with investors focused on more macro themes, FedEx’s report after the bell tomorrow should be closely watched. The global shipping company is well positioned to give the market some insight on how the pandemic is affecting the worldwide economy.
FedEx (NYSE:FDX) is expected to post a quarterly profit of $1.53 per share on revenue of about $16.9 billion, according to analysts’ forecasts compiled by Investing.com.
Last week Cowen lowered its price target on FedEx to $160 per share from $185, mainly due to expected impact of the virus.
“We expect a cut to FY20 guidance, but recovery commentary is key,” Cowen said.
Also in transportation airlines will be closely watched, with those long hoping the government can come in with a rescue package, which Trump says he is looking at “very closely”. The industry said it would need about $50 billion.
2. Retail Sales on Tap
On the economic front, the latest retail sales numbers will be front and center.
The Commerce Department will issue its report at 8:30 AM ET (12:30 GMT).
.Retail sales are expected to have risen 0.2% in February, down from a 0.3% rise in March, according to economists’ forecasts compiled by Investing.com.
At 9:15 AM ET, the February figures on industrial production and capacity utilization arrive.
Economists are looking for industrial production to have risen 0.4% and capacity utilization to have ticked up to 77.1%.
3. API Inventories Eyed
Along with stocks, oil prices took a beating, with WTI futures down 10.1% to $28.87.
U.S. oil output growth from the Permian basin is expected to offset declines in every other shale formation in April, helping push overall production up by about 18,000 barrels per day (bpd) to a record 9.08 million bpd, data showed today.
Output from the Permian basin of Texas and New Mexico, is expected to rise 38,000 bpd to a record 4.79 million bpd, data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration showed.

Financial markets had their worst day in 30 years despite emergency action by global central banks to try to prevent a recession, with U.S. stock markets falling 12% to 13%, wiping out trillions of dollars in market value.
Just a month ago, financial markets were hitting record highs on the assumption the outbreak would largely be contained in China and not cause disruptions beyond what was seen with earlier viral outbreaks of Ebola, SARS and MERS.

'INVISIBLE ENEMY'
U.S. states pleaded with the Trump administration on Monday to coordinate a national response to the outbreak, saying patchwork measures enacted by state and local authorities were insufficient to confront the coast-to-coast emergency that has killed at least 74 Americans.
A few hours later, President Donald Trump urged Americans to halt most social activities for 15 days and not congregate in groups larger than 10 people in a newly aggressive effort to reduce the spread of the coronavirus.
Calling the highly contagious virus an ""invisible enemy,"" Trump said the worst of the outbreak could be over by July, August or later and warned a recession was possible.
However, the United States was not yet closing its borders or mandating curfews or business closures on a national scale.
Many states and cities had already taken those steps or were preparing to. San Francisco area residents will be urged to shelter in place for three weeks starting on Tuesday, the San Francisco Chronicle reported.
A White House adviser said the United States could pump $800 billion or more into the economy to minimize economic damage.
EU finance ministers were planning a coordinated economic response to the virus, which the European Commission says could push the European Union into recession.
'TEST, TEST, TEST'
The World Health Organization (WHO) called on all countries on Monday to ramp up testing programs as the best way to slow the advance of the pandemic.
""We have a simple message to all countries - test, test, test,"" WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told a news conference in Geneva. ""All countries should be able to test all suspected cases. They cannot fight this pandemic blindfolded.""
In Italy, another 349 people died on Monday, taking the total to 2,158, with nearly 28,000 cases, after 368 deaths were reported on Sunday, a daily toll more dire than even China was reporting at the peak of the outbreak.
""Many children think it is scary,"" Norwegian Prime Minister Erna Solberg told a news conference dedicated to answering children's questions about the pandemic.
""It is OK to be scared when so many things happen at the same time,"" Solberg said.
Several countries banned mass gatherings such as sports, cultural and religious events to combat the fast-spreading respiratory disease that has infected nearly 179,000 people globally and killed more than 7,000.
Spain and France, where cases and fatalities have begun surging at a pace just days behind that of Italy, imposed severe lockdowns over the weekend.
The Middle East business and travel hub of Dubai said it was closing all bars and lounges until the end of March. Thailand plans to close schools, bars, movie theaters and popular cockfighting arenas.
Public health experts in the United States and elsewhere are hoping the measures will help spread out the number of new cases over time so as not to overwhelm hospitals and healthcare systems as has happened in Italy.
Italy's Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte told daily Corriere della Sera that the outbreak was still getting worse, though the governor of Lombardy, the northern region that has suffered the worst, said he saw the first signs of a slowdown.
The International Olympic Committee will hold talks with heads of international sports organizations on Tuesday, a source close to a federation briefed on the issue said, amid doubts the Tokyo 2020 Olympics set to start on July 24 can proceed."

Investing.com – Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) has plunged about 50% since accelerating to record highs just a month ago, but one analyst on Wall Street says the dip is not worth buying as the automaker continues to sport a frothy valuation.
""At current levels, Tesla stock remains high enough that it takes very aggressive assumptions on its future auto business to justify its valuation on a (discounted cash flow) basis,"" Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi said.
Sacconaghi stopped short of calling time on Tesla's bull run despite highlighting the near-term risk to automaker following the coronavirus-led impact to auto sales.
""We see more near-term risk to estimates at Tesla than most other IT hardware or growth tech names, but believe shorting Tesla on this basis is more a market/Covid-19 call than a stock call,"" he added.
The bearish call on Tesla arrived on a day when its share price plunged 18% after RBC Capital cut his price target on the company and flagged concerns about deliveries falling short of estimates.
RBC cuts its price target on Tesla to $380 from $530, on fears that constrained demand in the second quarter, may force the company to cut production. The bank expects Tesla to deliver 364,600 vehicles for 2020 and 572,100 for 2021, down from his prior estimates of 524,200 and 618,000, respectively.
""Ultimately, we see 1Q20 challenges given typical (end-of-quarter) push, very low 2Q20 demand given a weak auto market and lower mid-term growth as the consumer reels and Tesla's products are luxury,"" RBC warned. ""We believe this experience could dent the multiple investors will be willing to pay for the Tesla story."""

Investing.com – The Dow suffered its biggest one-day points plunge ever on Monday and the second-biggest percentage drop as a wave of late selling hit Wall Street after President Donald Trump said the worst of the outbreak could last through the summer and that it was not currently under control.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 12.97%, or 2,997.10 points. The S&P 500 lost 11.98%, and Nasdaq Composite lost 12.32%.
In a blow to hopes the Covid-19 pandemic could be contained sooner rather than later, Trump suggested it could continue into July or August. The president also urged Americans to avoid traveling and gathering in public spaces.
Real Estate and energy led the sea of the red on Wall Street, with latter paced by a 9.5% drop in oil prices on fears of a prolonged slump in travel demand amid the virus outbreak.
Airlines, meanwhile, were given a boost after Trump vowed to ""backstop airlines 100%,"" at a time when the industry has come under siege as travel demand continues to drop.
United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) and Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) fell 15% and 6.7% respectively, while American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) surged 11.2%.
Financials were also among the biggest decliners, led by Wall Street banks, several of which detailed plans to scrap share buybacks in order to maintain sufficient capital to keep credit lines open to customers.
Several banks, including Bank of America (NYSE:BAC),  Citigroup  (NYSE:C), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), temporarily halted buybacks for the remainder of the first quarter and the second quarter of 2020.
In tech, meanwhile, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) fell 13% after the iPhone maker said it would close all of its stores outside of China for the next two weeks to contain the spread of the coronavirus and was hit with a record $1.2 billion fine by French antitrust authorities. Apple and two suppliers were found to have agreed not to compete on prices and distribution."

SEATTLE/CHICAGO/PARIS (Reuters) - Boeing (NYSE:BA) and Airbus face a drop in planned deliveries as airlines struggle to survive the coronavirus crisis, sending shares in planemakers plunging on Monday.
The world's largest planemakers make most of their money when they deliver jets, but airlines are doing everything possible to preserve cash as air travel plummets and even financially sound U.S. carriers could defer deliveries.
""We don't know what the world is going to look like in two weeks let alone two months,"" one industry source close to fleet plans told Reuters on Monday.
Boeing did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Dozens of brand-new aircraft were sitting outside factories at both planemakers, especially jetliners destined for China, witnesses said. China was the initial epicenter of a coronavirus outbreak that is now rapidly spreading across the world.
Up to 20 of Airbus' hot-selling A321 jets were parked at its Hamburg, Germany facility. Meanwhile, one industry source said finished 787 Dreamliners were idled at Boeing's plant in South Carolina, a key program already hit by slower sales in a softening widebody market.
Boeing shares fell as much as 20.5%, while Airbus closed down 7.2% after losing as much as 24% of its value at one stage.
MAX FACTOR
More problematically for Boeing, the global health crisis threatens the smooth return to service of its money-spinning 737 MAX, as cash-strapped airlines push off plans to absorb the grounded planes or make pre-delivery downpayments.
United Airlines President Scott Kirby has said the airline will not take deliveries for the time being, a decision that could also push back its 2021 delivery schedule.
The head of Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV), Boeing's largest 737 MAX customer, has said it will keep options open on aircraft deliveries this year as it watches demand.
Meanwhile, Airbus deliveries have been hit by the impact of the coronavirus on airline operations, especially in China, as well as snags in ramping up production and new travel rules.
In order to make it easier for airlines to take delivery without sending big teams, Airbus has rushed to design a tool called Electronic Transfer of Title (ETOT) which involves doing the transaction at a distance after reviewing photographs.
It usually takes several airline officials to review the paperwork, last-minute quality checks and financial arrangements needed to transfer the ownership or ""title"" of the asset worth tens of million of dollars and approve delivery.
In most cases airlines are still required to send pilots to fetch the jets. One option being considered is for Airbus to deliver planes with its own pilots, but a question mark remains over how quickly airlines will take planes that are not needed.
""Airlines can find ways to delay taking delivery,"" said one person familiar with the process. Qatar Airways is one airline that has been known for delaying delivery, citing its stringent standards, although analysts have also cited market pressures."

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Less than 48 hours after U.S. President Donald Trump bragged about his soothing influence on the stock market, Wall Street tanked again.
The U.S. stock market's gains under Trump are rapidly disappearing as the fast-spreading coronavirus pandemic drives fears of a global recession.
The S&P 500 (SPX) tumbled 9% on Monday, erasing all of its gains from a furious rebound late on Friday that happened seconds after Trump declared a national emergency to combat the rapidly spreading coronavirus.
Trump has repeatedly boasted about the stock market's performance during his three years in office, and on Saturday he told reporters:
""I was honored to see that the stock market — you were mostly there with us — set a record in a short period of time — over a 45-minute period that we had the press conference yesterday in the Rose Garden. That was a record. All-time record. I think we should do one of them every day, perhaps. How about every — how about five times a day? We’ll do one five times a day.""
Despite Trump's optimism about the stock market, Monday's slump extended the S&P 500's loss from its peak on Feb 19 to about 27%. Investors dumped stocks after the Federal Reserve's drastic move on Sunday to cut interest rates to near zero amplified worries over the extent of damage from the pandemic.
Graphic - Trump's Wall St gains disappear: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/3500/3461/Wall%20St%20down.jpg
As the coronavirus spreads fear of a recession, most of the S&P 500's gains under the Republican president, a major part of his case for reelection in November, have disappeared.
At its February peak, the S&P 500 was up 58% from when Trump unexpectedly beat Democratic rival Hillary Clinton in November 2016. As of Monday, Trump's stock market was up just 15% from that time. The Dow is now up 14% since Trump was elected."

U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson urged all British citizens to stop “non-essential” travel and contact with other people in an effort to fight the fast-spreading coronavirus outbreak.
Johnson warned that without “drastic action” now, the rate of infections could double every few days. He discouraged mass gatherings from Tuesday, saying they won’t receive the support of emergency services, and urged everyone who can do so to work from home.
“Now is the time for everyone to stop non essential contact with others and to stop all unnecessary travel,” the prime minister said. “You should avoid pubs, clubs, theaters and other such social venues.”
Officials accepted these so-called “social distancing” measures would be very difficult for the public, but stressed the plan would make a big difference to reducing the peak of the outbreak. The government is trying to protect the National Health Service from being overwhelmed by the scale of the pandemic.
Johnson’s dramatic statement, in a press conference in London on Monday, followed criticism that he has been too slow to take aggressive action in the fight against the virus.
Under the plan:
If one person in a household has symptoms, the whole household must stay at home isolated for 14 daysIndividuals living alone with symptoms should isolate for 7 daysPeople most at risk should be “shielded” from contact with others for 12 weeksLondon is at higher risk and residents should pay attention to advice to stop contactFurther action including school closures may be needed in futureThe measures will be necessary for “a minimum of weeks or months” and it may be longer “if we are to minimize mortality,” said the government’s Chief Medical Officer, Chris Whitty. The public should realize fighting coronavirus is going to be “a marathon.”
The prime minister accepted that his measures will be “a very considerable challenge for businesses big and small” and promised the government is doing all it can to ensure companies have the liquidity they need, including through relaxing the tax system.
He said it is “obvious” the virus would deliver a potentially severe blow to the British economy, but “if we work together we can ensure it is a short term problem.”
Group of Seven leaders agree markets should have access to liquidity, Johnson said, in answer to a question on the need for a global fiscal stimulus. “If we do things jointly I think the global markets will understand we are all operating on the same fiscal framework,” he said.

1268,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 16, 2020 03:25PM ET</span>",Traders 'flying blind' in turbulent markets as coronavirus splits up teams,"By Saikat Chatterjee and Dhara Ranasinghe
LONDON (Reuters) - At a time of extraordinary swings on world markets, many traders working from out-of-town offices or in unfamiliar dealing rooms fear that communication problems and technical glitches risk adding to already spiraling volatility.
Banks' contingency plans to safeguard markets and employees through the coronavirus pandemic could over time transform the trading and investment world, with more staff working from home or in smaller centers rather than being concentrated in expensive locations like London's Canary Wharf or Manhattan in New York.
For now, though, such ""business continuity plans"" are proving frustrating for those forced to commute to New Jersey or the London suburb of Northolt, and scary given the potential for disruptions caused by telephone or internet outages.
Banks dismiss these fears: many told Reuters all systems have been replicated across locations, with staff linked by open phone lines and loudspeaker systems. For non-trading employees who can work from home, they have also stumped up for recorded phone lines, faster servers and additional screens.
Yet, for the head of cash equities at a European bank in Hong Kong, unfamiliar offices and equipment carry stresses that only add to what they see on their monitors.
""You not only get nightmares of a fat-finger error by you or one of your team members, but a slew of other things including cyber hacks or a trade not going through due to some error at the back-end operations,"" he said.
""Our risk and tech guys have been spending sleepless nights to ensure none of those events take place.""
While trading volumes are holding up well, there are some alarming signs -- above all, the occasional struggle to execute orders in the $17 trillion U.S. Treasuries market. There are also episodes such as last Monday's Australian dollar mini 'flash crash', when bid-ask spreads briefly widened nearly eight-fold, suddenly pushing the exchange rate below $0.63 from $0.655.
The same day, option trading on Wall Street's VIX volatility index (VIX) seized up for several minutes at the open as market-makers failed to come through with prices.
It was not clear whether remote working caused these episodes but it probably hasn't helped; JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) notes there is no precedent for the sheer scale of market-making that traders split into different locations.
Cyber hacking, higher transaction costs, poorer liquidity and greater volatility were the sort of ""operational risk event"" that could ensue, it warned.
JPM noted for instance that roughly two-thirds of the volume in longer-maturity U.S. Treasuries were transacted at a higher spread last week than during past selloffs. Market depth was also affected, it said, citing the average size of the top three bids and offers.
It said that on March 9, 60% of trades in 30-year U.S. Treasuries had been executed at a bid/offer gap of over 0.5 ticks, versus almost none at the end of February.
At Dutch bank ING, which has split up teams around the world, executives acknowledge changed working conditions, with some monitoring fewer screens for instance. But the main focus is on managing existing risk rather than providing liquidity, says Obbe Kok, ING's head of financial markets in the UK.
""We haven't experienced exactly this before so we expect there will be an impact for liquidity but we don't know exactly how much,"" Kok said.
NOT LIKE BEFORE
The U.S. Federal Reserve and other central banks have moved repeatedly, including on the weekend, to ensure liquidity isn't a problem, slashing interest rates and pledging billions of dollars in asset purchases.
One G7 central bank official said traders, unable to gather in familiar offices to test strategies, were possibly more wary of executing complex trades, causing some sectors to start ""gumming up"".
""There was much less trading and there were big differences between the buyers and sellers,"" he said, adding that central bank moves would help markets ""un-gum"".
Trading has evolved since the 2008 crisis, with machine-reading algorithms replacing many of the traders who got deals done by barking orders into phones or punching numbers into electronic platforms.
The bank-to-bank Treasury market is dominated by automated, high-frequency traders (HFTs) who work in small sizes but often, using pre-programmed algorithms.
But what has not been tested is these machines' ability to function for any length of time without backup from traders, risk managers and operational staff who ensure smooth settlement of deals.
Past incidents show however that when volatility spikes, HFTs can turn skittish; split-working, which erodes humans' ability to intervene quickly, could exacerbate this, JPM noted.
""If that occurs, we believe this particular circuit breaker will not function effectively, which could significantly extend the vicious cycle of higher volatility begetting lower liquidity,"" JPM warned.
BUYSIDE
Meanwhile, investors are noticing the difference.
Ross Hutchison, a fund manager at Aberdeen Standard Investments, said contingency measures were ""starting to hamper trading"".
""There are simply less traders available than before the virus started.""
While Treasury market seize-ups were probably more down to the dash for safe-havens than to remote working, investors note widening bid-offer spreads across all bond markets.
Mike Riddell, head of UK fixed income at Allianz (DE:ALVG) Global Investors, said bid-offer spreads in the UK government bond markets, one of the world's most traded, were about five times' normal levels last Monday.
Trading liquidity on the interest rate futures desk was worse than in 2008, he added.
Others, sent home by their funds, were struggling to work with two screens instead of the normal five or six, which one investment strategist described as ""flying blind.""
""My productivity has fallen sharply,"" they said.

(Reuters) - Several automakers on Monday said U.S. buyers of new vehicles will have the option to defer their payments and customers with existing car loans could ask for payment rescheduling if impacted by shutdowns due to the spread of coronavirus.
The move is also aimed at boosting new car sales during a time of uncertainty for dealerships, as an unprecedented wave of closures and restrictions is prompting millions of U.S. workers and students to stay home to slow the spread of the outbreak.
More than 4,100 people in the United States have been confirmed as being infected with the fast-spreading virus.
 Ford Motor Co  (N:F) on Monday said its credit unit is offering customers purchasing new vehicles the option to delay their first payment by 90 days. A U.S. spokesman for Nissan Motor Co Ltd (T:7201) said the automaker will launch a similar program.
 Hyundai Motor  Co (KS:005380) on Friday said it would defer payments for select new cars by 90 days and provide up to six months of payment relief for customers who lose their job.
Ford, Nissan, General Motors Co (N:GM) and Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203) also said they will provide payment relief options to customers affected by the virus, including extensions and deferred lease payments.
""We are working with customers on a case-by-case basis regarding payment deferrals and waiving late fees,"" a GM spokesman said.
U.S. auto loans have been climbing at a steady rate since 2011 and were up $16 billion in the fourth quarter of 2019 to $1.33 trillion nationwide, according to data by the New York Federal Reserve.
More than 7 million Americans are already 90 or more days behind on their car loans and serious delinquency rates among borrowers with the lowest credit scores have by far seen the fastest acceleration.
For America's working poor, having a car is often an essential ingredient for keeping a job and forced closures of restaurants and other businesses could exacerbate the situation.
So far, automakers and their suppliers have avoided production shutdowns in the United States due to parts already en route, or resorting to air shipments and different plants.
But analysts are reducing their 2020 sales forecast for the U.S. market due to the outbreak.  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analyst Adam Jonas said in a research note last week he expects ""demand shock"" to send U.S. auto sales down 9% this year. Before the outbreak, he had expected a decline of 1% to 2%."

Investing.com –The Dow resumed its plunge toward session lows Monday, paced by financials after a short-lived breather on the back of hopes of more stimulus to combat the Covid-19 impact on the economy following the Federal Reserve’s rate cuts and liquidity initiatives.
The S&P 500 fell 8.2%, the Nasdaq Composite lost 8.6% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 9.1%.
With little evidence that countries outside of China are making progress to curb the spread of Covid-19, investor fears concerning a virus-led global recession continued to grow.
Financials led the broader move lower after major banks scrapped plans to buy back shares in order to maintain sufficient capital to keep credit lines open to customers.
Several banks, including Bank of America (NYSE:BAC),  Citigroup  (NYSE:C), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), temporarily halted share buybacks for the remainder of the first quarter and the second quarter of 2020.
Airlines, meanwhile, helped limit losses in the broader market after rising from lows on after reportedly calling on the government to shell out more than $50 billion in aid to curb the impact on travel demand from the coronavirus. 
United Airlines Holdings (NASDAQ:UAL) and Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) fell 17% and 8% respectively, while American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) was down 1%.
Adding to hopes of stimulus, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer is reportedly proposing $750 billion for a third coronavirus bill, “to deal with hospital capacity issues, expand unemployment insurance, fund emergency child care, assist schools on remote learning, assist seniors’ needs for medicine/food delivery and to use DOD resources,” CNN reported."
1271,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 16, 2020 02:55PM ET</span>","Kudlow Says $400 Billion Virus Measures Under Way, More to Come","(Bloomberg) -- Measures worth about $400 billion are already under way from the White House and Congress to offset the economic shock from the coronavirus -- and the administration is ready to double that figure, President Donald Trump’s economic adviser Larry Kudlow said Monday.
The $400 billion figure includes steps taken by the executive branch -- including delay of tax deadlines and relief for interest payments on student loans -- and legislation now in Congress that would expand sick leave and offer financial support for virus testing, Kudlow said in an interview with Fox Business Monday. He didn’t break down the numbers.
Speaking after the interview with reporters, Kudlow said the administration is ready to double the fiscal stimulus to $800 billion, with “most” of the remainder coming from a temporary cut in payroll taxes. Trump has backed that idea, but lawmakers from both parties have been unenthusiastic.
The U.S. is shutting down swaths of its economy to prevent the spread of the virus, following the path taken by other countries in Asia and Europe, and that’s set to deliver a sharper economic blow.
The Federal Reserve late Sunday cut its benchmark interest rate back to near zero and announced a massive program of bond-buying to cushion the impact of the epidemic. But economists say what’s really needed is fiscal support for households and businesses that lose income, and the administration has been criticized for being slow to act."

(Reuters) - Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co's shares plunged another 20% on Monday, erasing all gains recorded during ousted CEO Dennis Muilenburg's tenure, as the mounting economic fallout of the coronavirus pandemic added to uncertainty around the 737 MAX's return to service.
The coronavirus outbreak could hit Boeing's cash flow further, as airline customers cancel flights and defer capital expenditure due to a plunge in travel demand. Possible delivery deferrals have raised concerns of production cuts at Boeing's larger widebody aircraft, which had not been impacted by the 737 MAX grounding.
""Further stress on the cash flows for airlines from flight cancellations could push aircraft deliveries to the right, exacerbating near-term cash flow for Boeing,"" Jefferies analyst Sheila Kahyaoglu said on Friday.
Kahyaoglu lowered the price target on the stock to $300 from $350, citing the risk of a potential dividend cut at Boeing.
Aviation regulators do not have a specific timeline for the 737 MAX's recertification that will allow deliveries to begin and generate the much-needed cash for Boeing as its debt continues to mount.
Reuters reported https://reut.rs/2w0F71T last week that Boeing is set to drawdown the full amount of a $13.8 billion loan, likely bringing its total debt to $41.1 billion, up from $27.3 billion in 2019. 
""Markets are melting down, airlines are grounding fleets, and traffic has collapsed. This has all dwarfed the MAX disaster,"" said Richard Aboulafia, analyst at Teal Group. 
Boeing rival Airbus SE's shares fell as much as 24% in Paris to hit a more than three year low. Reuters reported on Monday that Airbus had drawn up contingency plans to slow or stop production, if France is placed under a drastic lockdown due to coronavirus.

PARIS (Reuters) - Airbus (PA:AIR) has drawn up contingency plans to slow or stop production if France is placed under a drastic lockdown due to coronavirus, two people familiar with the matter said.
The plans, which range from a progressive slowdown to a full shutdown in production, anticipate a ripple effect from the lockdown across the planemaker's main industrial network in four countries, France, Germany, Britain and Spain, they said.
A complete halt in production is not currently seen as the most likely development, but that will depend on the nature of fresh health measures expected to be announced later on Monday.
""As we speak, our production facilities are open with strict health and safety protocols following national regulations. We are permanently following the situation and developments in our home production countries,"" an Airbus spokesman said.
He added: ""We are looking at all kinds of scenarios to maintain business continuity.""

Contingency planning accelerated on Monday as French President Emmanuel Macron prepared to make a televised address to the nation at 1900 GMT, amid speculation that France may consider new measures to deal with the coronavirus outbreak.

Some food chains including  Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc  (N:CMG) and Fried chicken chain KFC, owned by Yum! Brands (N:YUM), are offering free delivery to offset in-store declines.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's major supermarkets are working on plans to streamline their operations by cutting cafes, counters and other services to enable a depleted workforce to maintain basic provisions during the coronavirus outbreak, industry sources told Reuters. 
The country's supermarket sector, including market leader  Tesco  (L:TSCO), Sainsbury's (L:SBRY), Asda (N:WMT) and Morrisons (L:MRW), has struggled for more than a week to keep shelves stocked as shoppers panic-buy items such as dried pasta, canned food, toilet rolls and hand sanitizer.
Shop bosses have said trading levels have been close to those seen in the pre-Christmas rush, the busiest time of the year. Online grocery operations have also been running at capacity.
Executives are working on plans to keep the stores running if large numbers of their staff become ill or if the outbreak forces the closure of nurseries and schools, which would escalate workers' child care needs.
""What (products) we can and can't get is the least of our current challenges,"" one British supermarket executive told Reuters on condition of anonymity.
The person said more pressing problems would be how to staff stores and how to give practical help to the elderly and vulnerable when the virus takes deeper hold of the population.
A government decision to close all schools would be ""a binary moment,"" the person added. It's a step the British government has so far resisted.
Another source at a supermarket group said planning was focused on: ""What would it take to keep the store running?""
The source said this could involve a more streamlined operation in individual stores that would keep them running with fewer staff.
Options could include temporarily closing in-store cafes and fresh food counters.
Health officials have said 36 people have died from coronavirus in Britain, while the total diagnosed was 1,543.
The government has forecast the virus will peak in 10 to 14 weeks' time.
The supermarket industry says it is working closely with government and suppliers to keep food moving through the system and is making more deliveries to stores to get shelves re-stocked. But it has also appealed to customers to be more considerate.
""Generally there's plenty of supply in supermarkets but it is just the levels of panic-buying, particularly in some categories, that are occasionally causing issues,"" the second source said.
There are also bottlenecks in the distribution chain.

""You've only got so many trucks and so much picking ability within the suppliers' warehouses and depots. And then have you got enough people in the stores, once it arrives, to actually replenish the items on shelf?""

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Alphabet Inc (O:GOOGL) began disclosing revenue for its YouTube video service this year after U.S. securities regulators asked the Google parent to give more ""quantitative and qualitative"" data on the business, according to filings released Monday.
Alphabet's Chief Accounting Officer Amie Thuener O’Toole wrote to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission on Dec. 20 saying that in response to comment from SEC staff, ""We will separately disclose YouTube advertising revenues"" even though ""there have been no significant changes to our advertising business,"" according to one regulatory filing.
The letter followed a comment from the SEC's corporate finance division last October, asking the company to revise its quarterly filings to provide more detailed information on key business units, according to another filing.
""We note that YouTube, mobile search and desktop search have experienced different growth and monetization rates and enjoy different margins,"" the SEC staff wrote. ""As such, they represent significant subdivisions or components of Google properties revenues that should be discussed separately to allow investors to view the company through the eyes of management.""
The SEC declined to comment on the filings on Monday.
Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
In the Dec. 20 letter, Thuener O’Toole also wrote that Alphabet also would disclose the growth of Google Cloud revenues ""although we do not believe it is currently a required disclosure.""
Offering detailed YouTube and cloud data for the first time last month, Alphabet said YouTube ad revenue grew 31% in the fourth quarter compared with last year and the cloud business grew 53%.
Thuener O’Toole's letter said the company did not view separating out ad revenue by mobile or desktop as meaningful because it generally does not sell ads by device type."

Investing.com – Wall Street moved off session lows on Monday as the Federal Reserve pumped more liquidity into the market just a day after slashing rates and reverting to its financial-crisis-era bond-buying program in an attempt to keep a lid on the economic damaged from the Covid-19 outbreak.  
The S&P 500 slipped 6.91%, the Nasdaq Composite lost 7.31% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 7.8%, or 1,800 points, though had fallen by as many as 2,800 points at the lows.
The New York Fed said midday Monday it would conduct a $500 billion repo operation this afternoon in a bid to shore up short-term funding markets and avert a liquidity squeeze.
The move comes a day after the Fed slashed its benchmark interest rate by 100 bps to a range of 0% to 0.25%.
The U.S. central bank also offered a number of liquidity-boosting measures, including currency swaps, along with its central banking peers like the European Central Bank and the Bank of Canada, to make it easier for financial institutions to trade currencies and receive U.S. dollars.
The wave of stimulus, however, did little calm investor jitters over the coronavirus-led impact on the economy as the trading was halted earlier in the day after the broader market plunged more than 7%.
The selloff on Wall Street comes at a time when health authorities raised concerns about the lack of testing for the virus in some nations.
""We have not seen an urgent enough escalation in testing, isolation and contact tracing, which is the backbone of the response,"" the World Health Organization said.
In tech, meanwhile, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) fell more than 8% after the iPhone maker said it would close all of its stores outside of China for the next two weeks to contain the spread of the coronavirus and was hit with a record $1.2 billion by French antitrust authorities.

The Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s general business conditions index fell 34.4 points to minus 21.5, the lowest level since 2009, a report out Monday showed. The bank’s gauges of new orders, shipments and employment all fell into negative territory.
The figures suggest the coronavirus, which has disrupted global supply chains and is poised to significantly weigh on the nation’s growth, has already started to hit manufacturers. As more extreme measures are made to contain the virus, future readings may deteriorate further.
Manufacturers in New York expect a gloomier future too. The index of future business conditions also dropped to an 11-year low. A gauge of shipments fell to the weakest level since September 2016, and the index of the average employee workweek slumped to its lowest level since December 2015.
The survey responses were collected between March 2 and March 10.
Readings above zero indicate expansion, and the median forecast in a Bloomberg survey of economists had called for the gauge to decline to 3. The Empire State survey is the first of several regional Fed manufacturing indexes to be released for the month. Others for areas including Philadelphia, Richmond and Dallas will be released throughout the month.

WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. markets should stay open despite intense volatility, the head of the U.S. securities regulator said on Monday, quashing industry speculation that the government might shut down the country's exchanges to stop a plunge in stock prices.
""Markets should continue to function through times like this,"" Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Jay Clayton told CNBC in a phone interview, adding that the SEC was closely monitoring markets and was working with exchanges and market infrastructure providers to ensure they could continue to function.
U.S. stocks plunged on Monday morning on mounting fears the coronavirus pandemic will cause a global recession, again triggering a circuit breaker which temporarily suspends trading. The S&P 500 index (SPX) has lost nearly $6 trillion since its record closing high in mid-February.
The turmoil prompted the U.S. Federal Reserve on Sunday to take aggressive action to buttress the economy and financial system, slashing interest rates to near zero, pledging hundreds of billions of dollars in asset purchases and backstopping foreign authorities with the offer of cheap dollar financing.
Some analysts speculated on Monday that closing the markets altogether might be the next step for regulators, which are rapidly running out of tools to arrest the turmoil.
""One might not be faulted to assume that a next major step might be to shut the stock markets to prevent a further, self-fueling sell-off,"" William O'Donnell, an analyst at  Citigroup  Global Markets Inc (N:C), wrote in a note on Monday.
Closing the markets is rare but not unprecedented.
The New York Stock Exchange, which is now owned by Intercontinental Exchange Inc, (N:ICE) most recently closed on Oct. 29-30, 2012 during Hurricane Sandy and before that on Sept. 11-14, 2011, following the terrorist attacks on the United States, according to its website. It also shut for four months during the outbreak of World War I, the longest closure on record.
""This is a World War against the virus, so maybe it’s not such a crazy idea?"" O'Donnell wrote.
The NYSE trading floor remained open on Monday, but the iconic bourse was taking additional precautions, requiring people entering the building to disclose if they had been exposed to the virus and to submit to a temperature check, according to a Reuters reporter present. Those entering the floor were given stamps on their forearm to indicate they'd been checked.
Speaking to Fox News on Monday, NYSE President Stacey Cunningham said closing the markets would be the ""wrong response,"" adding: ""It’s important that investors have access to their money."" Nasdaq Chief Executive Officer Adena Friedman also told CNBC on Monday it was ""critically important"" that markets remained open.
The European Union's markets watchdog said on Monday it was lowering the threshold for reporting short-selling, whereby traders profit by betting stocks will fall, to regulators for the next three months as current trading conditions posed a ""serious threat"" to ""fragile"" markets.

Clayton said the U.S. markets overall had continued to function well, re-opening in an orderly manner following the triggering of circuit-breakers last week.
""Things have been functioning well in our markets over the past two weeks of a very volatile time,"" he added."

FRANKFURT/LONDON (Reuters) - Two of Germany's largest banks have temporarily closed hundreds of branches while in Italy lenders are shortening opening hours as they grapple with staff shortages and try to limit the spread of coronavirus.
Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) will close several hundred of its roughly 1,000 branches in Germany, a spokesman said, adding that the exact number was still to be determined, while HVB plans to close 101 of its 337 branches during the course of Monday.
Customers will still be able to use ATMs, online services and those branches that remain open. Several of Germany's savings banks have already closed or are planning to close branches as well.
In Italy, the country's biggest retail bank Intesa San Paulo (MI:ISP) said its large branches - amounting to around 900 from a total of 3,500 - are opening only in the morning while most of its smaller sites are operating three mornings a week. Around 122 small branches, which are located nearer large ones, have closed.
UniCredit, which has around 4,000 branches, said last week it would keep only a limited number open in each region.
Other Italian banks are following suit, with Banca Monte dei Paschi (MI:BMPS) also opening only in the morning.
Lenders are hoping the increased use of digital banking will limit the disruption caused by the restricted branch services.
In Britain, Spain and France, most banks remain fully open although some have issued statements encouraging customers to use online services where possible.
""Despite complex operational conditions, all employees in the networks are and will remain fully mobilized to help their clients to get through this exceptional crisis ...banking networks will be open and branches are prepared,"" France's banking federation said in a statement on Sunday.
Lloyds (L:LLOY), Britain's biggest domestic lender, said it was waiving fees on missed payments on credit cards, loans and mortgages, giving repayment holidays, allowing emergency access to fixed term savings accounts and raising online banking deposit limits to help people unable to access their local branches.
""We are making some temporary changes over the coming weeks, and will be providing individual support to customers who need extra help,"" Group Director Vim Maru said

Joe Spak, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, slashed price targets for all 22 of the companies he covers and downgraded four of them in reports Monday that assess the impact of Covid-19. He described the cuts to his projections as “drastic, but reasonably plausible” and said his team actually worries they aren’t extreme enough.
“The situation is very fluid but it’s not hard to imagine that vehicle demand comes to a complete halt amid social distancing” and “a stressed consumer,” Spak wrote. “And let’s be honest, buying a new vehicle may be a low priority for many once things settle down.”
Tesla shares plunged as much as 19% as of 10 a.m. in New York, while GM and Ford slumped as much as 14% and 11%, respectively.

1294,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 16, 2020 10:56AM ET</span>","Brought to the brink by coronavirus, airlines seek emergency aid","By Sarah Young and Laurence Frost
LONDON/PARIS (Reuters) - Airlines made unprecedented cuts to flights, costs and staffing on Monday, stepping up calls for emergency aid as coronavirus lockdowns and new travel restrictions hit more major routes.
Already battered shares in British Airways parent IAG (L:ICAG), easyJet (L:EZJ) and Air France-KLM (PA:AIRF) plunged again as they scrapped most flights for the coming weeks, joining other major carriers that are all but halting operations in the face of the pandemic.
""It is now clear that the coronavirus is by far the biggest crisis in the history of aviation,"" Finnair Chief Executive Topi Manner said, as the carrier announced a 90% capacity reduction and its second profit warning in three weeks.
The outlook darkened further after Spain declared a state of emergency and the United States extended travel curbs to Britain and Ireland, while Australia and New Zealand began requiring all travelers to self-isolate. Germany advised citizens against non-essential trips abroad.
The travel collapse threatens more bankruptcies in the wake of British carrier Flybe's failure this month.
Troubled Norwegian Air (OL:NWC) on Monday laid off 90% of its workforce and canceled 85% of flights, while the Italian government prepared to take control of Alitalia with another cash injection of 600 million euros ($668 million).
In an unusual joint statement, the world's three main airline alliances - oneworld, SkyTeam and Star Alliance - called for government aid to alleviate the ""unprecedented challenges"" faced by the industry.
U.S. officials and lawmakers view the situation with increasing alarm. United (O:UAL), American (O:AAL) and Delta Air Lines (N:DAL) are in talks with the government about potential assistance backed by pilot and flight attendants' unions. Tax relief and federal loans are being considered, officials say. 
IAG, which also owns Spain's Iberia and Vueling, said it would cut April-May capacity by at least 75% and postpone CEO Willie Walsh's retirement - keeping successor Luis Gallego at Iberia's helm as the group navigates the crisis.
Besides cancelling flights, the group announced moves to freeze discretionary spending, reduce working hours and temporarily suspend employment contracts.
Budget carriers Ryanair (I:RYA) and easyJet announced plans to ground most of their fleets, with the latter echoing calls for government help.
""Coordinated government backing will be required to ensure the industry survives,"" easyJet CEO Johan Lundgren said.
In Europe, IAG's shares had fallen 25% by 1413 GMT, while Ryanair was down 18%, easyJet down 17% and Air France-KLM 17% lower. In New York, Delta was down 18%, and American 15% lower. 
""Airlines are siphoning cash and have no way of stopping it"" as bookings grind to a halt and traffic collapses for six to eight weeks, Bernstein analyst Daniel Roeska said.
With carriers' survival now in government hands, he added, ""the key focus should be on emergency liquidity support and enabling short-term layoffs or working-hour reductions to safeguard cash.""
The German, French, Dutch and British governments have all said they are considering ways to help the industry.
'UNPRECEDENTED' 
IAG's Walsh, who has railed against state aid to rivals throughout his career, said airlines should continue to try self-help first.
But he added: ""Clearly where governments are providing general support particularly for employees that are being impacted by the current crisis, we would avail (ourselves) of those general facilities.""
BA's archrival Virgin Atlantic said on Monday it would axe London-Newark flights permanently and ask staff to take two months of unpaid leave.
Air France-KLM said it would park its entire Airbus A380 and Boeing 747 fleets as it reduces operations by 90% and discusses emergency aid with the French and Dutch governments. CEO Ben Smith also told staff on Monday he had cut his own pay by 25%. 
The group will use government-funded partial layoffs to find 200 million euros in cost-cuts as it reins in capital expenditure by a further 350 million.
Airlines are also likely to postpone new jet deliveries, a prospect weighing on Boeing (N:BA) and Airbus (PA:AIR), whose shares were down 18%. Aircraft and engine makers also face a slump in parts and maintenance sales as air traffic withers.
""Demand is drying up in ways that are completely unprecedented,"" aviation consultant CAPA said in a report, predicting that most global airlines would go bust by June without government help. ""Normality is not yet on the horizon.""
Cathay Pacific struck a leaseback deal to transfer six of its Boeing 777s to BOC Aviation Ltd (HK:2588) for $704 million in precious cash, the Hong Kong-based carrier announced on Monday - along with its own 90% capacity cut.
Azul scrapped international flights from its main Sao Paulo hub, and Chile's Latam warned of further cuts.
Germany's Tui AG (DE:TUIGn) and Scandinavian carrier SAS (ST:SAS) also said they were suspending the vast majority of operations and seeking government aid.
Finnair (HE:FIA1S) predicted a substantial loss this year as it announced the near-halt of operations and scrapped its dividend. Icelandair (IC:ICEAIR) also slashed capacity and said it was in union talks to cut its wage bill.
Earlier, United Airlines (O:UAL) said March revenue had dropped by $1.5 billion and planes may remain near-empty into the summer even after severe schedule cuts. ""This crisis is moving really quickly,"" CEO Oscar Munoz and President Scott Kirby told employees in a Sunday memo.
Air New Zealand Ltd (NZ:AIR), which has halted trading in its shares until Wednesday, also plans job cuts after cutting long-haul capacity by 85%, CEO Greg Foran warned.
""For the coming months at least, Air New Zealand will be a smaller airline requiring fewer resources, including people,"" he said.

A measure of fear in U.S. stocks surged on Monday as an emergency move by the Federal Reserve to ease policy did little to calm markets over the spreading coronavirus.
The CBOE Volatility Index jumped as high as 76.3 in early trading, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That was just shy of its highest level since the 2008 financial crisis, which it posted during last week’s turbulence. Futures contracts on the gauge that expire on Wednesday also hit a historic 72.8.
Monday’s surge is the latest extreme move amid the sell-off engulfing markets as investors fret the impact of the virus. U.S. stocks fell so fast they hit a trading pause for the third time in a week. The S&P 500 last week recorded the biggest plunge since the crash on Black Monday in 1987.
Wall Street’s fear barometer, which tracks the 30-day implied volatility of the S&P 500 based on out-of-the-money options prices, wasn’t quoted earlier because futures for the benchmark equity gauge had hit their lower limit.
The futures curve on the VIX remains in backwardation, indicating that traders see more turbulence in the near-term than further in the future. The VIX hit its highest intraday level of 89.53 on Oct. 24, 2008.

The brokerage expects the 34% decline in Nike's revenue for the quarter to lead to a loss of about 4 cents per share. Analysts currently expect revenue to rise 2.4% to $10.43 billion and profit of 64 cents per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
""Mall traffic may cease in coming weeks and fixed costs and future inventory markdowns create an almost impossible modeling exercise globally,"" said John Kernan, who is a five-star rated analyst for the accuracy of his earnings estimates on Nike.
Nike shares fell nearly 16% amid plunging broader markets. The stock has lost a third of its value since the start of the year.
Almost 170,000 people have been infected by the virus globally and millions more have seen their lives turned upside down due to ""social distancing"" and clamp-downs on gatherings of large groups become the new norm.
Major sporting leagues such as the NBA and the NFL have also suspended their seasons, while companies including Nike,  Lululemon Athletica  Inc (O:LULU) and  Under Armour  Inc (N:UAA) have shut stores in North America and other markets in an effort to curb the spread of the pandemic.
""There are parallels between the coronavirus impact on Nike and other brands from the cancellation of major sporting events with the impact on travel companies from the U.S. travel ban,"" Jonathan Treiber, a retail-industry sales expert and the CEO of marketing platform provider RevTrax.
Meanwhile London-based Woozle Research estimates Nike could be robbed of more than $5.5 billion in revenue over the next three to six months.
The company's global sales is already estimated to be down 21% between mid-February and March 10, according to about 120 major wholesalers and distributors of Nike products in China, Europe and North America polled by the research firm.
Nike's revenue last fiscal year totaled about $39.12 billion.
""People don't want to spend $150 or $200 on a pair of VaporFly Nike trainers right now,"" one of the respondents told George Mosley, senior equity analyst at Woozle, which is contracted by firms including hedge fund Citadel and private equity firm KKR to conduct research on companies they are invested in.
Nike's largest rival, Adidas (DE:ADSGN), said last week it expected first-quarter sales to drop by up to 1 billion euros ($1.1 billion) in greater China, and overall to fall more than 10%.
Nike, which reports third-quarter results next week, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. It has already warned of a financial impact to its China business."

Hewson has been with the Pentagon's largest defense contractor since 1983 and took over as chief executive in January 2013. 
""The timing is right not only for our company, but for me personally."" Hewson said in a post on LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD), adding she plans to spend more time with her family. 
Under Hewson's leadership, Lockheed stock has gained more than three-fold, thanks to expanded international demand, the F-35 fighter jet program and other military contracts that grew due to increased U.S. defense spending under President Donald Trump.
Michele Evans, who took over as executive vice president of Lockheed's aeronautics division in October 2018, was widely seen as a leading candidate to succeed Hewson. 
Frank St. John another Lockheed executive who began at the company as an intern had was also seen as a prospective successor. The company named St. John as chief operating officer when it announced Hewson's successor.
Lockheed had changed its mandatory retirement age rules in 2018 to exempt the CEO, allowing Hewson to stay on past 2019.
Taiclet has been the chairman, president and CEO of American Tower Corp, a REIT that invests and operates telecom assets, since 2004. 
He has previously worked with Honeywell Aerospace Services, a unit of Honeywell International (N:HON), and United Technologies Corp (N:UTX) in senior roles.
""Taiclet has an impressive pedigree based on his resume, but from an aerospace and defense perspective he is an unknown quantity,"" said Robert Stallard an analyst at Vertical Research in a note on Monday morning. ""But with Marilyn sticking around as Chairman, and a very experienced cohort of senior Lockheed managers, we are not expecting there to be any revolutionary change,"" Stallard said. 

Lockheed said the CEO changes are effective June 15.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets fell the most since 1987 in early trading on Monday, having been suspended, limit down, almost immediately after trading started, as the shutdown of increasing swathes of public life in the U.S. brought home the scale of the coronavirus outbreak.
By 9:50 AM ET (1350 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 2,773 points or 12% at 20,393 points. The S&P 500 was indicated down 10.7% and the Nasdaq Composite was down 11.5%.
Investors weren’t reassured by the emergency measures taken on Sunday night by the Federal Reserve, which cut the target range for fed funds to near zero and signalled $700 billion in asset purchases to keep financial markets orderly.
The Fed also said it would extend the availability of dollars internationally through swap facilities with other central banks.
""The Fed has pulled out all the stops. But in the end the underlying driver of this crisis is very different from 2008/9, i.e. this is about COVID-19,"" said Robin Brooks, an economist with the Institute for International Finance in Washington, DC. ""That means the Fed can alleviate the symptoms, but it's unreasonable to expect the crisis to go away on Fed action.""
Earlier on Sunday, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin urged investors to look beyond the short-term hit to the economy, telling CNBC that ""There will be a huge amount of pent up demand when this is done. And it will be done.”
However, Mnuchin also warned that ""the goal is not to bail out companies,” a line that appeared to raise the risk of near-term bankruptcies, especially in the transport and oil sectors.
Among the worst hit were airline stocks. United Airlines stock fell over 15% after saying it would slash capacity by 50%, while Delta Air Lines  (NYSE:DAL) stock and American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) stock also fell heavily after the Trump administration expanded restrictions on arrivals from Europe to include the key routes serving London and Dublin.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock fell as much as 13% before rebounding to be down only 9.7% after the company said it will shut all its stores outside China. It was also hit by a $1.2 billion antitrust fine in France.
Oil and gas stocks tumbled again as crude prices fell below $30 a barrel and U.S. gasoline prices fell to an all-time low of 69 cents a gallon.
Banks were also badly hit, as the Fed's action threatened to crush lending margins without, at least in the short term, supporting income from currency and securities markets. Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) stock fell 14.6%, while JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) stock fell 15.1% and Citigroup  (NYSE:C) stock fell 19.7%.
Casino operators MGM Resorts (NYSE:MGM) and Wynn Resorts  (NASDAQ:WYNN) also both fell after the pair announced they would temporarily close their casinos in Las Vegas, essentially putting much of the famous strip under lockdown.

1300,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 16, 2020 09:14AM ET</span>","Make us ventilators to fight coronavirus, UK asks Ford and Rolls Royce","By Guy Faulconbridge, Kate Holton and Costas Pitas
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain has asked manufacturers including Ford (N:F), Honda (T:7267) and Rolls Royce (L:RR) to help make health equipment including ventilators to cope with the coronavirus outbreak and will look at using hotels as hospitals.
Britain, which has reported 35 coronavirus deaths and 1,372 cases, has taken a different approach to some European countries that have imposed stringent lockdowns to try to slow the spread of the disease.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson will speak to manufacturers to seek support for the production of ""essential medical equipment"" for the National Health Service, a spokesman for his Downing Street office said.
""He will stress the vital role of Britain’s manufacturers in preparing the country for a significant spread of coronavirus and call on them to step up and support the nationwide effort to fight the virus,"" the spokesman said.
Hotels will be used as emergency hospitals, retired doctors are being asked to come back to work and some elective surgery is being canceled.
AIR AND BEDS
Many countries are trying to buy ventilators, used to keep people with coronavirus alive if they struggle to breathe.
Health Secretary Matt Hancock said there had been an enthusiastic response to the call for ventilator production.
It was, though, not immediately clear how a manufacturer of jet engines or cars could turn to producing specialist medical equipment, which international parts would be needed or what certification would be required.
One option could be to adopt defense industry rules which can be used to order certain factories to follow a design to produce a required product quickly. British industry has the capability to do that but is unlikely to make the electronic components that would also be required.
Johnson is due to give a news conference later on Monday and will also hold a call with major companies.
Rolls Royce, a British engineering company that makes the jet engines for the biggest Boeing (NYSE:BA) and Airbus planes, said it was ready to help in any way it could.
Honda, which built just under 110,000 cars at its facility in Swindon in England last year, said it had been asked by the government to explore the feasibility of making additional ventilators.
Ford operates two engine factories in Britain, which made just under 1.1 million engines in 2019. A spokesman said it was assessing the situation. One of the two sites, in Bridgend in Wales, is due to close this year.
Peugeot-owned (PA:PEUP) Vauxhall has also been asked to help.
With a steep increase in cases expected, Hancock said on Sunday many hotels were empty and could provided ready-built facilities for looking after people, but an oxygen supply and ventilation equipment would be needed."

1302,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 16, 2020 08:36AM ET</span>","As passengers stay home, UK rail operators ask for bailout","LONDON (Reuters) - Companies running rail services in Britain have asked the government for a financial bailout as Britons increasingly work from home to avoid spreading coronavirus, sending passenger numbers plunging, a source told Reuters.
Passenger numbers have fallen by about 18% on some lines, according to anecdotal early evidence from the rail industry, as the formal data is not yet available, putting the viability of some rail contracts at risk.
Many Britons are working from home instead of commuting. State-owned Transport for London (TfL) said on Monday that passenger numbers on London's Underground network fell 19% in the week starting March 2 in response to coronavirus.
Britain's privatized rail network is split into areas with the government contracting out services. Some of the contracts rely on passenger numbers growing to meet their financial commitments and could face failure as a result of coronavirus.
Companies running train services include Arriva UK Trains, part of Germany's Deutsche Bahn, UK transport operator FirstGroup (L:FGP) and Govia, a joint-venture between Go-Ahead (L:GOG) and France's Keolis.
The source familiar with the situation said the industry as a whole was in early talks with the government.
Asked about a bailout for the rail industry, the UK's Department for Transport did not comment specifically, but said it was engaging with the industry.
""We recognize how difficult the current situation is for the transport sector and, across government, we are engaging with the sector’s leadership to support workers, businesses and passengers,"" a DfT spokeswoman said in an emailed statement.
Britain's rail industry group, the Rail Delivery Group, said that train companies were regularly in discussions with the government, without giving details.
Even before the impact of coronavirus, many rail contracts were already looking problematic, after operators had been over-optimistic about future passenger numbers and after infrastructure upgrades took longer than expected.
Britain in January nationalized the Northern Rail contract and has said that it was considering whether to nationalize FirstGroup's South Western Railway as it was not financially sustainable in the long term.
Shares in FirstGroup plummeted 46% in morning trading, hitting an all time low, since listing in 1995, while Go-Ahead was down 27%, its lowest level since 2003."

1304,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 16, 2020 08:00AM ET</span>",EU watchdog puts spotlight on market bets amid coronavirus rout,"By Huw Jones and Sudip Kar-Gupta
LONDON/PARIS (Reuters) - Hedge funds and other investors will have to give regulators more information about the bets they are taking, the European Union's markets watchdog announced on Monday, warning that a markets slump triggered by the coronavirus could last weeks.
The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) said it has lowered the threshold for reporting short-selling to regulators as current trading conditions pose a ""serious threat"" to market confidence.
""There is a clear risk that such downward trend will continue in the coming days and weeks,"" ESMA said.
In short-selling, traders borrow a company stock with a view to selling it, hoping to buy them back later at a lower price and pocket the difference.
When the number of short-sellers outweighs those interested in buying the stock, which could happen if investors rush to sell amid panic over coronavirus, that can further drive down the price of shares.
Under the new regime, short-sellers must report a transaction if their net short position reaches or exceeds 0.1% of the issued share capital, compared with 0.2% before Monday's announcement.
The tougher reporting requirement apply to trading positions as of close of trading on Monday.
""ESMA considers that lowering the reporting threshold is a precautionary action that, under the exceptional circumstances linked to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, is essential for authorities to monitor developments in markets,"" ESMA said.
""The measure can support more stringent action if required to ensure the orderly functioning of EU markets, financial stability and investor protection.""
Regulators in Spain and Italy imposed short-selling curbs last week but stock indexes on Monday continued their slide.
Under EU law, national authorities have the power to introduce such bans. They are required to inform the EU umbrella body, the European Securities and Markets Authority.
Many countries curbed short-selling in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis. While such bans can soften the impact of a shock, however, experts say they only work for a limited time and have little impact on the overall market.

1306,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 16, 2020 07:28AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Flying blind - Marubeni's Gavilon ignored Brazilian red flags,"By Ana Mano
SAO PAULO (Reuters) - When Japanese conglomerate Marubeni (T:8002) booked a loss of 3.9 billion yen ($35 million) at its U.S. grain trader Gavilon in November, it blamed adjustments for ""inappropriate transactions"" with Italy and Spain.
While Marubeni didn't give further details, the issues that led to the loss stretched back years and had been overlooked by Gavilon's U.S. managers despite repeated warnings from accountants and some company executives in Brazil, according to audits, emails and four people familiar with the matter.
Brazilian risk controllers at Gavilon do Brasil raised red flags as early as June 2016 about lax accounting that ultimately let the company book inaccurate estimates for freight costs, boosting its profits and masking losses, according to three sources and documents about Gavilon's risk mitigation efforts.
That same month, an Ernst & Young audit flagged to Gavilon do Brasil managers that its processes left room for fraud. In 2017, EY said in another audit seen by Reuters that there was a ""significant deficiency"" in the way freight costs were booked.
Yet it was only in 2019 when Gavilon adopted a new accounting methodology that major discrepancies were revealed between actual shipping costs and the freight costs recorded in Gavilon's books, leading to an internal investigation.
A person familiar with the enquiry said it revealed a shortfall of about $25 million related to accounting issues with freight expenses for Brazilian corn destined for Italy and Spain and about $10 million from other misvalued positions - leading to the declared loss.
A Gavilon representative said the company did not comment on internal financial matters.
A Marubeni spokesman declined to respond to Reuters' questions about Gavilon or its losses.
EY declined to comment citing confidentiality issues.
During the internal investigation, Gavilon dismissed several executives at its U.S. headquarters but did not explain publicly the reason for their sudden departure.
Reuters was unable to reach them for comment and could not verify that the dismissals were connected to the investigation.
FLYING BLIND
Gavilon do Brasil's former chief financial officer Paulo Silva spoke out in 2017, warning U.S. executives that accounting issues in Brazil could snowball if they weren't tackled.
He said it was not uncommon for new firms to operate without major issues during the first couple of years but the risks at Gavilon had increased significantly as the volume of grain traded had risen sharply.
""Without proper flight controls the situation can develop into a blind flight all of a sudden,"" Silva wrote in an email, seen by Reuters, to Gavilon executives in the United States in August 2017. He left the company about two months later.
Silva declined to be interviewed.
Before the $35 million hit, Gavilon's Brazilian operation had been driving breakneck growth at the agribusiness firm, which Marubeni bought for $3.6 billion in 2012, nearly doubling its grain trading volumes overnight.
In its 2018 fiscal year, Gavilon do Brasil's revenue surged to more than 10 billion reais ($2.2 billion) - six times sales just three years earlier, according to public filings.
Gavilon's soybean sales from Brazil to China, the world's top exporter and top importer respectively, jumped more than 20-fold in four years to 4.5 million tonnes in 2019, making it the fifth-largest player in the business, shipping data show.
But when Brazilian executives raised concerns with their U.S. bosses about accounting shortcomings, senior management deferred to the fast-growing trading division, rather than dig into issues that could draw unwanted attention from Marubeni, three sources familiar with the matter said.
Brazilian risk officers said in a June 2016 presentation that after years of aggressive growth, Gavilon ""now lacks controls and higher levels of governance to manage its business"", according to emails and documents about the presentation seen by Reuters.
EY's audit report that month flagged to managers at Gavilon do Brasil that there were unwarranted manual entries in the books compiled without proper approval or documentation, which created ""opportunities for errors or fraudulent activities"".
Management replied that changes proposed by auditors were impossible due to software limitations and it proposed a parallel system for documentation, the audit report showed.
'UNCONTROLLABLE SNOWBALL'
In its 2017 audit, EY flagged similar issues again. It also warned of another risky practice: Gavilon was regularly using freight suppliers to give short-term, or ""spot"", rates - without entering into a formal contract nor providing evidence of any bidding process between shipping firms to get the business.
EY called this a ""significant deficiency"" which left it with no way to know if actual shipping costs were reflected in the books. ""To improve the company's internal controls, the spot method should only be used for specific operations on an urgent basis,"" the EY audit said.
In July 2017, Gavilon missed its profit estimate by $5 million due to accounting issues in Brazil, catching U.S. bosses by surprise, according to an email from Gavilon's former global controller Jeremy Koeppe.
""Our environment is not as controlled as it needs to be nor is it as controlled as I thought it was,"" wrote Koeppe, who could not be reached for comment.
Reuters could not determine the exact accounting issues that led to the profit miss.
Silva had complained about ""lots of last minute (by month end) changes in the freight tables"", which made it harder to prepare profit and loss reports. He said the logistics unit often updated freight estimates after accountants had told traders the value of their positions based on market prices.
Internal messages seen by Reuters showed that Silva had made repeated calls for tighter controls to avoid, ""a horrible uncontrollable snowball"".
Two other people familiar with accounting practices at Gavilon do Brasil echoed Silva's concerns, with both saying traders could easily adjust freight prices recorded in the books to offset market swings affecting their positions.
""(This) leads us to think that they might be trying to 'manage' their results and freight prices,"" Silva wrote."
1307,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 16, 2020 07:25AM ET</span>","BA owner, easyJet make drastic cuts to try to survive coronavirus","By Sarah Young
LONDON (Reuters) - The owner of British Airways and easyJet, Europe's no.3 and no.4 airlines, warned aircraft would be grounded on an unprecedented scale in a battle to survive the coronavirus, but while easyJet said state aid was needed, BA's owner talked of self-help.
Britain's government said it would discuss how to protect the industry from the coronavirus pandemic after easyJet on Monday joined Virgin Atlantic in calling for government help as people across the world stop traveling.
""European aviation faces a precarious future and it is clear that coordinated government backing will be required to ensure the industry survives,"" easyJet's CEO, Johan Lundgren, said in a statement. 
BA-owner IAG (L:ICAG) did not ask for government aid, however. IAG CEO Willie Walsh, who on Monday deferred his retirement due to the crisis, has long opposed any government aid and told investors that airlines should look at self-help first.
""I think individual airlines have been approaching governments looking for state aid. We have not done so,"" he said, adding that the group would however accept any general facilities provided to all companies which would benefit employees. 
Shares in both airlines dived in morning trading. IAG, which also owns Spain's Iberia and Vueling carriers and Aer Lingus, was down 23%, its lowest level since 2013, while easyJet lost 18%, its lowest level since 2012. 
EasyJet, which is in regular contact with the UK government, said it wanted governments to provide access to finance to help overcome any short-term liquidity crunches, plus a removal of passenger taxes, a holiday from air traffic charges as well as an extension of the relaxation of a rule in relation to airport slots. 
(Graphic: Airline's debt, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/3466/3427/airlines.png) 
GROUNDED 
IAG said it would cut its flying capacity by at least 75% in April and May, while easyJet (L:EZJ) said it could ground the majority of its fleet on a rolling basis. The airlines are the no.3 and no.4 European carriers on a passenger number basis. 
Both airlines said they had strong balance sheets and Citibank research showed that easyJet and IAG would still have much lower net debt to EBITDA ratios than Air France-KLM (PA:AIRF) and Lufthansa (DE:LHAG) after a simulated three-month shutdown. 
IAG said it had total liquidity of 9.3 billion euros, while easyJet said it had 1.6 billion pounds of cash plus an undrawn $500 million revolving credit facility.
""IAG has substantial resources to weather the storm,"" said Bernstein analyst Daniel Roeska. 
Both airlines said they could not provide profit guidance for their current financial years. IAG also detailed cost cuts including a freeze on discretionary spending, working hours reductions and a temporary suspension of employment contracts.
Walsh also told investors that 2021 capacity was likely to be lower than currently planned, and that the crisis would accelerate the permanent retirement of dozens of aircraft including BA's 747s and Iberia's A340s.

1308,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 16, 2020 07:25AM ET</span>",‘They Blew It’: Wall Street Reacts to Fed’s Emergency Cut,"(Bloomberg) -- The Federal Reserve’s shock interest-rate cut and bond-buying program rippled through global markets on Monday, with S&P 500 Index futures falling by the most allowed and Treasury yields plunging at the start of what promises to be another volatile week.
Early reaction to the Fed moves on Wall Street was mixed. Some said the measures will help stabilize jittery financial markets, while others warned that the central bank’s emergency actions risked adding to investor panic.
There was one refrain from across the spectrum, however: Policy makers the world over will have to roll out more monetary and fiscal stimulus to counter the economic fallout of the worsening coronavirus pandemic.
Here are some of the latest insights:
Blew It
Michael O’Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading:
“They blew it. The Fed panicked and the market is spooked. The S&P 500 registered all time highs less than a month ago and the Fed has expended all its conventional and unconventional tools. The key takeaway will be that they have truly expended all of their ammunition and this is the action of a central bank that is scared.”
Fiscal First
James McCormick (NYSE:MKC), global head of desk strategy at NatWest Markets:
“The fact is global equities are still getting slammed. It shows markets worried more about infection rates and growth and need to see a large fiscal response. Monetary policy will not have the same potency for financial markets -- it is not enough on its own and there isn’t much ammunition left. The theme has been clearly on display in markets since the Fed’s first rate cut two weeks back. But this is not the end of monetary policy, not by a long shot. Fiscal policy announcements will now be watched more closely and discounted more quickly by financial markets.”
Forward Guidance
Roberto Perli, partner at Cornerstone Macro LLC:
“Overall, I believe the package is robust, but it also left something to be desired in some areas, like the unclear forward guidance and the reliance on the heavily stigmatized discount window. Nonetheless, Powell was clear that the Fed reserves the right to use other tools if appropriate.”
Largely Inconsequential
Peter Mallouk, president of Creative Planning, which manages about $45 billion:
“It’s largely inconsequential. The bottom line is this is a health issue. People are going to be surprised how little the economic incentives and plans are going to help until we start to see a change in the infection and death rate and I would take a 5% improvement in the war against the coronavirus over a 100% move in terms of economic incentives and initiatives.”
Some Confidence
Mark Haefele, CIO, UBS Global Wealth Management:
“Broad fiscal spending and rate cuts are blunt instruments for dealing with the short-term economic impact of the virus, but should provide investors with some confidence that growth can be strong once the recovery gets underway. We expect the market to end the year at much higher levels than today, with China’s economy leading the way to recovery and the U.S. and European economies rebounding in the third quarter.”
No Choice
Jeff Mills, chief investment officer of Bryn Mawr Trust:
“They had no choice, but it won’t be enough in the grand scheme of things. We need large fiscal programs, which based on the recent communication from the Treasury secretary it seems clear we will be getting.
“If we get the fiscal stimulus side of the equation, the eventual recovery will likely be more robust than it would be otherwise.”
Fed Leading
Alicia Levine, chief strategist, BNY Mellon Investment Management:
“The Fed is leading global central banks. The mixture of policy action exceeds market expectations and, importantly, will help corporate credit markets as it unleashes a flood of liquidity. The disquieting message from last week’s market moves in the credit and Treasury markets was the contraction of liquidity and this action should help calm that dislocation. Expect the Treasury yield curve to steepen on this action.”
Pulling All the Stops
Joachim Fels, global economic adviser at Pacific Investment Management Co.:
“A global recession in response to a combination of a supply disruptions and a sudden stop of demand for (mostly) services appears to be a foregone conclusion.
“The Fed’s actions will help to restore an orderly functioning of the very core of the U.S. financial markets: the Treasury market and the U.S. mortgage market.
“All said, policy makers including the Fed are in the process of pulling all the stops to mitigate the severe economic and financial disruptions caused by the most severe global health crisis in more than a century. More will be needed and will likely be forthcoming over the next few weeks and months.”
Global Funding Squeeze
Ian Lyngen, head of U.S. Rates strategy at BMO Capital Markets:
“The coordinated action between the Fed/BoE/BoJ/ECB/SNB/Bank of Canada to lower the price on the central bank swap lines should help ease overseas funding stress by both reducing the cost of dollars for foreign banks, but also by adding the 84-day maturity option -- in addition to the 1-week currently. This should help reduce the probability of global funding squeeze -- whether it will be enough will be determined in the coming days.”
Targeted Lending
Krishna Guha, head of central bank strategy at Evercore ISI:
“Equity market futures continued to tumble following the announcement as he spoke. This troubling reaction likely reflects some combination of buy the rumor/sell the news from Friday, concern that the Fed has fired its bazooka and fiscal needs to step up too if this is to work, and missing elements on the liquidity/credit front.
“The Fed cannot do a lot about the first two but it can and should address the third. In our view the absence of TAF cash auctions and emergency 13(3) lending programs to shore up the credit markets starting with a CPFF backstop for commercial paper leaves the powerful package incomplete.”
Growth Shock
Jason Daw, a strategist at  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN):
“In normal circumstances, a large policy response like this would put a floor under risk assets and support a recovery. However, the size of the growth shock is becoming exponential and markets are rightfully questioning what else monetary policy can do and discounting its effectiveness in mitigating coronavirus-induced downside risks.”

1309,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 16, 2020 07:16AM ET</span>","U.S. Treasury yields fall after aggressive Fed action, but off lows","LONDON (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury yields fell on Monday but were off their overnight lows in volatile trade after the Federal Reserve stepped in with sweeping measures to protect the economy in the face of the coronavirus outbreak.
Global central banks moved aggressively on Sunday to buttress a world economy that's rapidly unraveling. The Fed slashed interest rates to near zero, pledged hundreds of billions of dollars in asset purchases and backstopped foreign authorities with the offer of cheap dollar financing.
In European trade on Monday, the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield was down almost 20 basis points at 0.76% (US10YT=RR), but above an intra-day low of 0.63%. It held above recent record lows at around 0.32%.
Short-dated Treasury yields, down 17 bps on the day at 0.32% (US2YT=RR), were also up from session lows hit earlier at 0.27%.
Analysts said trading was thin and it was difficult to read too much into market signaling, but a stronger picture was likely to emerge when New York markets opened and trading picked up.
""The Fed has now done a lot in terms of rates and QE (quantitative easing), but the question in markets is whether monetary policy can solve the problems being created by coronavirus,"" said John Davies, G10 rates strategist at  Standard Chartered  (LON:STAN) Bank in London.
European stock markets (STOXX) were down and U.S. equity futures pointed to a hefty selloff when Wall Street opened (ESc1) (1YMc1).
Bond analysts added that the volatile moves in U.S. government bonds - regarded as one of the safest assets in the world - could also be explained by some investors selling their Treasury holdings to cover losses in other markets.
""There is nothing logical about the way bond markets are trading right now,"" said Pooja Kumra, European rates strategist at TD Securities."

MILAN (Reuters) -  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) is halting production for two weeks at most of its European plants to help protect staff against the coronavirus pandemic and adjust to a slump in demand, the Italian-American carmaker said on Monday.
Italy has been the European country worst hit by the crisis and the first to enforce a nationwide lockdown, which has now been replicated by Spain and, to a lesser extent, by France as the virus sweeps through the continent. 
With all non essential services closed, including car dealers, and people forced home except for strict working needs, many forecast a heavy fall in car sales in March.
FCA (MI:FCHA) - which according to analyst estimates produces around 25% of its vehicles in Europe - said the suspensions through March 27 would allow it ""to effectively respond to the interruption in market demand by ensuring the optimization of supply"". 
Marco Opipari, an analyst at Fidentiis, said a few weeks of closures was not a big problem in an over-supplied European auto industry and lost production could be recovered later on. 
""The real problem is on the demand side, people are not buying cars now, and sales volumes are expected to be very bad in March, with a real impact on automakers' earnings,"" he said.
FCA (N:FCAU) said in a statement that production for its FCA Italy and luxury Maserati units would stop for two weeks, extending a temporary closure period already planned for some Italian facilities. 
Affected plants are Melfi, Pomigliano, Cassino, Mirafiori, Grugliasco and Modena in Italy, Kragujevac in Serbia and Tychy in Poland.
The FIOM union said FCA's decision was ""necessary"". 
The carmaker said the freeze would help it to resume activity promptly once market conditions allow it.
""The group is working with its supply base and business partners to be ready to enable our manufacturing operations to deliver previously planned total levels of production despite the suspension when market demand returns,"" it said.
FCA's decision follows similar moves by other Italian car and auto part makers, as the coronavirus outbreak deals another blow to a European automotive industry already struggling with weak global demand and tough new pollution regulations. 
Italy is still allowing manufactures to operate provided they comply with strict safety measures. However, a growing number of companies are opting to suspend production.

Last week, luxury carmaker  Ferrari  (MI:RACE) said it was closing its two plants until March 27, citing an emerging shortage of parts. Premium brakes maker  Brembo  (MI:BRBI), whose clients include Maserati, said it would temporarily close its four Italian plants this week.

A measure of fear in U.S. stocks surged to the highest since 2009, surpassing last week’s peak as an emergency move by the Federal Reserve to ease policy did little to calm markets on edge over the spreading coronavirus.
The generic front-month futures contract for the CBOE Volatility Index jumped as high as 57.9 on Monday. The gauge measures traders’ expectations for where the VIX will trade a month from now.
Wall Street’s fear barometer, which tracks the 30-day implied volatility of the S&P 500 based on out-of-the-money options prices, wasn’t quoted as of 9:15 a.m. London time. A notice on Cboe’s website said the opening for S&P 500 and VIX products has been delayed.
Monday’s surge sent VIX futures beyond their highs of last week, which included several limit-down pauses to U.S. stocks and the S&P 500’s biggest tumble since the crash on Black Monday in 1987.
Following Friday’s huge rebound in stocks, futures on the S&P 500 have hit trading limits with a decline of almost 5%. Benchmark Treasury yields retreated more than 30 basis points at one point, as coordinated action by central banks appeared to do little to stem the bleeding."

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are set to post hefty losses at the open Monday, with investors greeting Sunday’s moves by the Federal Reserve to mitigate the economic damage from a spreading coronavirus pandemic with mounting anxiety.
At 7:05 AM ET (1105 GMT), futures for the S&P 500 traded 4.8% lower, futures for the Nasdaq 100 down 4.6%, while the DJI futures contract fell 4.6%. These contracts were suspended after plunging to hit their daily limits, suggesting the cash markets could open even lower.
The Federal Reserve held an emergency meeting Sunday, cutting short-term rates to a target range of 0% to 0.25%, announcing at least $700 billion in purchases of Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities in coming weeks and offering cheap dollar financing to financial institutions around the world facing stress in credit markets.
These moves come as governments around the world sought to stem the spread of the virus that has infected over 169,000 people globally and killed more than 6,500.
In the U.S., there have been school closings, runs on grocery stores, shuttered restaurants and retailers, and ends to sports events. 
Shares in United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) dropped over 16% in premarket trading after the company said it’s slashing its flight schedule by 50% for the next two months, seeing revenue in March down $1.5 billion from last year. Shares in American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) and Delta Airlines (NYSE:DAL) are also sharply lower.
Shares in Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) fell over 11% in premarket trading after announcing it is closing all of its stores outside greater China until at least March 27. This matches the response of a number of retailers, including  Nike  (NYSE:NKE) and Urban Outfitters (NASDAQ:URBN).
Shares in cruise operator Carnival (NYSE:CCL) dropped over 20% premarket after it cancelled all its North American cruise lines for at least a month, amid a drop in global demand for holidays due to the spread of coronavirus.
Elsewhere, the oil market has been hammered by the combination of a hit to demand from the economic slowdown caused by the coronavirus and a price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia, two of the globe’s largest producers.
AT 07:10 AM ET (1110 GMT), U.S. crude futures traded 6.5% lower at $30.03 a barrel. The international benchmark Brent contract fell 9.4% to $30.66.

It already seems clear that Friday’s rally was not the turning point that some emerging-market investors hoped for. Nor will the U.S. Federal Reserve’s emergency rate cut on Sunday night be enough to reverse what’s the fastest collapse in risk assets in more than a generation.
While governments increase efforts to slow the spread of the coronavirus, stimulus measures could be too late to prevent a global recession, with businesses suffering from both supply and demand shocks. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index of equities fell 4.6% on Monday, while a measure of currencies lost 0.5%, even after the Fed cut its key interest rate almost to zero and promised to boost its bond holdings by at least $700 billion. Along with the central banks of Japan, the Eurozone, the U.K., Switzerland and Canada, it also said it use swap lines to ensure the international supply of dollars.
South Korea and Sri Lanka each cut interest rates in emergency moves on Monday, while China pumped liquidity into its financial system.
“Global markets are facing their gravest challenge since the Great Recession,” Andrew Sheets, Morgan Stanley’s London-based chief cross-asset strategist, said in a note on Sunday. “Low rates don’t solve a shortage of semiconductors if a factory needs to shut down. A tax cut won’t show up as spending if consumers don’t have confidence in the broader public health response.”

Emerging markets ended last week on a positive note, but it was small consolation. In the five days through Friday, MSCI Inc.’s index of developing-nation stocks crashed 12%, the most since the 2008 global financial crisis. The Mexican and Colombian pesos each depreciated more than 8% against the dollar to record lows, battered by Brent oil’s slide below $35 a barrel. Average sovereign dollar-bond spreads blew out by 122 basis points to levels not reached in more than a decade.

1314,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 16, 2020 06:49AM ET</span>","Airlines slash schedules, jobs and pay after new travel restrictions","By Jamie Freed and Tracy Rucinski
SYDNEY/CHICAGO (Reuters) - Airlines around the world said they would make more drastic cuts to their flying schedules, shed jobs and seek government aid after countries further tightened border restrictions because of the fast spreading coronavirus.
The owner of British Airways said on Monday that it would cut flying capacity by at least three quarters in April and May, and that its outgoing boss, Willie Walsh, would defer his retirement as the carrier tries to survive the fallout of the virus.
International Consolidated Airlines Group (LON:ICAG), the parent company that also owns Iberia and Aer Lingus, said it would also ground flights, freeze discretionary spending, reduce working hours and temporarily suspend employment contracts.
United Airlines Holdings Inc, one of the three largest U.S. airlines, booked $1.5 billion less revenue in March than during the same time last year and warned employees that planes could be flying nearly empty into the summer, even after severe flight cuts.
United said it would cut corporate officers' salaries by 50% and reduce flight capacity by about 50% in April and May, with deep capacity cuts also expected into the summer travel period.
""This crisis is moving really quickly,"" United Chief Executive Oscar Munoz and President Scott Kirby said in a memo to employees on Sunday.
Things worsened over the weekend as Spain declared a state of emergency, the Trump administration added Britain and Ireland to its list of countries facing travel curbs, and Australia and New Zealand said all travelers would have to self-isolate for 14 days.
""We call on Congress and the White House to take all measures available to protect the health and payroll of American workers,"" said Sara Nelson, president of the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA, which represents 50,000 U.S. flight attendants at 20 airlines, including United.
CAPA Centre for Aviation, an airline analysis and consulting firm, said most airlines globally will be bankrupt by the end of May without coordinated government and industry action to avoid such a catastrophe.
""Demand is drying up in ways that are completely unprecedented,"" CAPA said in a report. ""Normality is not yet on the horizon.""
U.K. airlines called on the British government to help ensure their survival, while Germany's Tui AG and Scandinavian carrier SAS said they would suspend the vast majority of operations due to the COVID-19 outbreak and apply for government support.
Finnair on Monday issued its second profit warning in three weeks, saying it would report a substantial comparable operating loss for 2020 as it was cutting around 90% of its normal capacity from the beginning of April. The Finnish airline also dropped its dividend.
EasyJet, Europe's fourth-biggest airline, said it could ground the majority of its fleet, while Icelandair Group hf said it was cutting capacity and working with labor unions to reduce its salary cost ""significantly"". 
Air New Zealand Ltd said job losses would be necessary as it cut long-haul capacity by 85% over the coming months. 
""We are now accepting that for the coming months at least Air New Zealand will be a smaller airline requiring fewer resources, including people,"" Air New Zealand Chief Executive Greg Foran said in a statement.
The airline has halted trading in its shares until Wednesday.
Qantas Airways Ltd said it would be making fresh cuts to its flying schedule beyond the 25% reduction in international capacity announced last week due to the new travel restrictions.
UBS analysts said the latest travel restrictions would have a significant effect on Qantas' international traffic, which historically accounted for around 45% of revenue and 25% of earnings before interest and tax. 
""A downside scenario where international traffic is down 50% for a whole year and domestic down 30% could result in cash burn of up to A$200 million ($123.60 million) per month after incorporating changes to the business,"" UBS said of Qantas.
Smaller rival Virgin Australia Holdings Ltd, which has a weaker balance sheet but a heavier domestic focus, said it was assessing its response to the new travel restrictions.
S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) Ratings downgraded its credit rating on Virgin to B- and placed it on creditwatch negative due to rapidly deteriorating industry conditions spreading from the international market to the domestic market. 

""Rating stability will increasingly rely on the company continuing to adjust its cost base to offset potential further material revenue erosion and limit cash outflows if the reduction in demand continues beyond the next few months,"" S&P said.

1317,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 16, 2020 06:16AM ET</span>",Swooning stocks signal higher likelihood of Trump losing election: Moody's Analytics,"By Jason Lange
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. stock market rout triggered by a deadly coronavirus outbreak suggests President Donald Trump is in grave danger of losing the November election, according to a forecasting model by Moody's Analytics, a leading Wall Street research firm.
That's a big change from what the model showed using data from February, when higher stock prices and Trump's steady approval rating pointed to the Republican president coasting to victory with 351 votes in the U.S. Electoral College to 187 votes for a Democratic challenger.
But financial markets have since plunged with the spread of the virus disrupting economic activity around the world and sparking fears of a global recession. A drop in the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index to 2,500 points - roughly Thursday's closing level - would signal enough economic anxiety to cost Trump the election, Bernard Yaros, an economist at Moody's Analytics, said on Friday.
""The S&P 500 would need to be 2,500 or less for Trump to lose,"" Yaros told Reuters in an email. He did not elaborate on the expected electoral college results in that circumstance.
U.S. companies are already reporting layoffs due to the health crisis but most economic data that will reflect that - and which experts use to make forecasts - won't be available for weeks.
That has Moody's Analytics, a leading forecasting firm, relying more on financial market movements which respond quickly to signs of economic trouble.
After plunging into bear market territory on Thursday, the S&P 500 recovered a small slice of its losses on Friday, finishing higher at 2,711 points after Trump declared a national emergency over the coronavirus. The U.S. Federal Reserve, seeking to prop up the economy amid the crisis, slashed interest rates to near zero on Sunday in an emergency move.
The coronavirus causes the COVID-19 respiratory disease and has killed at least 60 Americans and more than 6,000 worldwide.
Researchers have long found presidential incumbents do better at the polls during a strong economy but because voters also weigh other matters, many forecasters factor presidential approval ratings into their prediction models.
Yaros said his model's latest predictions, including the scenario he outlined to Reuters on Friday, use Trump's most recent Gallup approval rating of 47% in late February. That was a near-record high for his presidency after rising during impeachment proceedings in the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives. The Republican-controlled Senate acquitted him on Feb. 5 after a weeks-long trial.
In a report to clients on Thursday, Yaros said a decline in Trump's approval rating to 37% and the S&P 500 at 2,700 points would point to a Democratic candidate narrowly winning the Electoral College with 279 votes to Trump's 259.
U.S. voters pick their president through an indirect vote, selecting electors at a state level. To win the presidency, a candidate must win at least 270 votes from the 538 electors in the Electoral College.
Gallup is expected to release an updated approval rating for Trump this week. The president has come under fire for his response to the crisis and for initially downplaying the severity of the outbreak.
Voter opinions about the coronavirus response so far remained divided along party lines, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll from March 2-3, with Democrats more likely than Republicans to see the outbreak as an imminent threat to the United States and to say there were taking steps to be prepared.
While forecasters at U.S. universities and on Wall Street use sophisticated statistical models to predict election results, they do not have a pristine track record.
Many forecasting groups, including Moody's Analytics, failed to predict Trump's victory in 2016.
Moody's Analytics said its failure in 2016 appeared due to higher-than-normal voter turnout in the U.S. Midwest.
The coronavirus, which is currently making many Americans afraid to leave their homes, is another wild card for turnout in November."
1318,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 16, 2020 06:04AM ET</span>",StockBeat: The Bell Tolls Loud for Airlines; LVMH Takes Savvy Sanitizing Step,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- Around the world, policy-makers are taking increasingly extreme measures to combat the coronavirus, but they are not having much impact on stemming the panic in financial markets.
Everything with a hint of risk is being sold on Monday morning, and anything with a credible promise of safety is being bought. Investors worldwide are focusing on return ‘of’ capital, rather than return ‘on’ capital.
In Europe, corporate actions are following government actions with increasing rapidity. After cinemas, restaurants and bars, it’s now factories that are being closed: Fiat Chrysler said Monday it will suspend production at eight facilities across Europe, while tiremaker  Michelin  (PA:MICP) said it will shut plants in Spain, Italy and France. Others will surely follow, whether out of fear of exposing their workforces, or because their supply chains are frozen.
The news is even worse from the travel sector. International Airlines Group (LON:ICAG) said it expects to run schedules at no more than 25% of capacity in April and May, while EasyJet  (LON:EZJ)  said it will keep over half its fleet grounded.  Wizz Air  (LON:WIZZ) shares fell 20% after the company was forced to suspend flights in and out of Poland.
""European aviation faces a precarious future and it is clear that coordinated government backing will be required to ensure the industry survives,"" easyJet (LON:EZJ)'s CEO Johan Lundgren said in a statement.
While governments are making positive noises about supporting the travel sector, the lack of detail as to how existing shareholders will be treated under any government assistance programs leaves the stocks exposed to huge risks.
Other travel companies are hardly faring any better: Carnival (NYSE:CCL) said it would suspend four more cruise brands for a month, having shut down the ill-starred Diamond line for two months last week.
One stock whose political risk has probably been mitigated is arguably LVMH (PA:LVMH), which took the step of pivoting three of its big French perfumeries away from scent to making hand sanitizer. The company said it will distribute this free of charge to French hospitals. Owner Bernard Arnault, whose high-profile donation to restore Notre Dame cathedral after last year’s fire received a mixed response, will probably be expecting a better reception for this move.
Retailers  Kingfisher  (LON:KGF)  and Associated British Foods (LON:ABF), meanwhile, both illustrated a trend that’s likely to play out across the continent in the next few weeks, simultaneously talking up the easing of Chinese supply chain issues while warning of store closures in Europe. ABF’s Primark has now closed stores that account for 30% of sales, while Kingfisher’s Castorama and Brico Depot stores are now closed for a month.
The only light in the darkness? Spread-trading firm Plus500 (LON:PLUSP) said it expects revenue and profit for the full year to be “substantially ahead of current consensus expectations” thanks to the spike in financial market volatility.
Things are less bright for those who prefer to bet on sports rather than markets: Flutter Entertainment  (LON:FLTRF), the firm behind  Paddy Power  and Betfair, warned that the suspension of sporting events in Europe and elsewhere through August would cost it an estimated 110 million pounds in EBITDA. In one regard, at least, it did better than most companies updating on Monday. None of the others (including Plus 500) was able to give any meaningful guidance for the rest of the year."

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's Fast Retailing (T:9983) said only 30 of its 750 Uniqlo stores in China were still closed, meaning most of its shops outside Hubei province, the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak, had reopened.
Uniqlo had closed about 350 of its casual clothing stores in China, as well as closures at some partner factories, a month ago.
The closures have raised fears of a major hit to Uniqlo's profits. China has been a key growth market for the company, which faces a saturated market and weak consumer spending in Japan.
Fast Retailing shares closed on Monday at 46,000 yen, down nearly 30 percent since the beginning of the year.
Jefferies on Monday raised its rating on Fast Retailing to ""hold"" from ""underperform"", saying the company was resilient and had enough liquidity to survive a possible recession.
""China and Korea both appear to have gained control of the virus and many people appear to be returning to work,"" analyst Michael Jon Allen said in a note to clients.
""We think the worst for Fast Retailing's overseas operations is already in the past, and a slow but steady recovery has begun.""
A Fast Retailing spokeswoman said it had not yet decided on any closures in North America, where it has about 60 shops.
Retailers including  Nike  Inc (N:NKE) and  Lululemon Athletica  Inc (O:LULU) have said they were closing stores in the United States as the highly contagious respiratory illness has spread beyond China."
1320,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 16, 2020 05:56AM ET</span>",Stocks dive as Fed & co fail to calm panicky markets,"By Marc Jones and Wayne Cole
LONDON/SYDNEY (Reuters) - Stock markets were routed and the dollar stumbled on Monday after the Federal Reserve slashed U.S. interest rates in an emergency move and its major peers offered cheap U.S. dollars in a bid to prevent global lending markets seizing up.
The drastic maneuvers were aimed at cushioning the economic impact as the breakneck spread of the coronavirus all but shut down more countries, but they had limited success in calming panicky investors.
Europe, which has become the epicenter of the outbreak, saw its main stock markets plunge nearly 8% in brutal opening trade. Earlier, Wall Street futures for the S&P 500 index had hit their down-limit in the first 15 minutes of Asian trading as investors rushed for safety.
""The central banks threw the kitchen sink at it yesterday evening yet here we are (with deep falls in stock markets),"" said  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) strategist Kit Juckes.
""There is a great sense that central banks are going to get to grips with the issues of getting money flowing ... But the human problem, the macro problem, there is nothing they can do about that."" 
The Fed's emergency 100 basis point rate cut on Sunday was followed on Monday by further policy easing from the Bank of Japan in the form of a pledge to ramp up purchases of exchange-traded funds and other risky assets.
New Zealand's central bank also shocked by cutting rates 75 basis points to 0.25%, while the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) pumped more money into its financial system. South Korea cut rates and Russia rushed together a $4 billion anti-crisis fund. 
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said G7 leaders would hold a teleconference at 1400 GMT to discuss the crisis.
MSCI's index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan tumbled 4% to lows not seen since early 2017, while the Nikkei fell 2% as the BoJ's easing steps failed to reassure markets.
Chinese data underscored just how much economic damage the disease has already done to the world's second-largest economy, with official numbers showing the worst drops in activity on record. Industrial output plunged 13.5% and retail sales 20.5%.
In Asia, Shanghai blue chips fell 3% overnight even as China's central bank surprised with a fresh round of liquidity injections into the financial system. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index tumbled 3.4%.
Australia's S&P/ASX 200 plunged, finishing down 9.7% -- its steepest fall since the 1987 crash.
""By any historical standard, the scale and scope of these actions was extraordinary,"" said Nathan Sheets, chief economist at PGIM Fixed Income, who helps manage $1.3 trillion in assets. ""This is dramatic action and truly does represent a bazooka.
""Even so, markets were expecting extraordinary action, so it remains to be seen whether the announcement will meaningfully shift market sentiment.""
Sheets emphasized investors wanted to see a lot more U.S. fiscal stimulus and evidence the Trump administration was responding vigorously and effectively to the public health challenges posed by the crisis.
""The performance of the economy and the markets will be mainly determined by the severity and duration of the virus outbreak,"" he said.

UNDER STRAIN
Markets have been severely strained as bankers, companies and individual investors stampede into cash and safe-haven assets while selling profitable positions to raise money to cover losses in savaged equities.
To ease the dislocation, the Fed cut interest rates by a full percentage point on Sunday to a target range of 0% to 0.25%, its second cut this month, and promised to expand its balance sheet by at least $700 billion in coming weeks.
Five of its peers also joined up to offer cheap U.S. dollar funding for financial institutions facing stress in credit markets.
U.S. President Donald Trump, who has been haranguing the Fed to ease policy, called the move ""terrific"" and ""very good news"".
""It may be a shot in the arm for risk assets and help to address liquidity concerns ... however, it also raises the question of whether the Fed has anything left in the tank should the spread of the virus not be contained,"" said Kerry Craig, global market strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management.
""We really need to see the fiscal side ... to prevent a longer than needed economic slowdown.""
The Fed's rate cut combined with the promise of more bond-buying pushed U.S. 10-year Treasury yields down sharply, to 0.68% from 0.95% late on Friday.
It was a different story in Europe, where Southern (NYSE:SO) European bond yields jumped to multi-month highs as investors continued to worry about the rapid spread of the virus there.
Spanish and Portuguese 10-year bond yields rose to 9-1/2 month highs at 0.74% and 0.93% respectively, up as much as 13 basis points on the day.
French 10-year yields also soared as much as 14 basis points to 3-1/2 month highs at 0.14%, while Italian 10-year yields were up 17 basis points at 1.98%.
""The momentum we've seen in the periphery is largely to do with the sentiment toward debt metrics in countries which after many, many years of quantitative easing and existing central bank support within the euro zone, are going into another fairly significant if not larger crisis than the one before,"" said Rabobank strategist Matt Cairns.
The fall in U.S. Treasury yields had pressured the dollar early on Monday, though it regained some ground later on. It was last down 1.6% on the Japanese yen at 106.37. The euro was up almost 1% at $1.1212.
The commodity-exposed Australian dollar fell as much as 0.3% to $0.6166 while the New Zealand dollar slipped 0.2% to $0.6044.
Oil, already reeling from a price war, fell further on concerns about the impact of coronavirus on global demand. Brent crude was last off $2.21, or 6.5% at $31.64 per barrel while U.S. crude slipped $1.64 to $30.94 a barrel.

Gold rallied 0.8% to $1,541.34.

(Reuters) - European shares tumbled more than 8% on Monday as the coronavirus pandemic raged through much of Europe, with dramatic monetary easing by global central banks failing to reassure investors about its growing economic damage.
The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) fell 8.2% to its lowest since November 2012, with bourses in France (FCHI) and Spain (IBEX) leading losses as the two countries joined Italy in enforcing a national lockdown.
Airlines and holiday operators including TUI (L:TUIT), EasyJet (L:EZJ), British-Airways owner IAG (L:ICAG) and Air France - KLM (PA:AIRF) were among the biggest decliners on the STOXX 600 as the pandemic brought global travel to a standstill.
The wider travel and leisure index (SXTP) plunged more than 12%. Europe's fear gauge jumped to a record high of 87.90.
""The issue for investors is that the virus' economic impact is still not known - if this is a one-month event or a one-year event, and how deep the cutback in consumer spending is going to be,"" said Rick Meckler, a partner at Cherry Lane Investments in New Vernon, New Jersey.
The U.S. Federal Reserve slashed interest rates to near zero in its second emergency move this month and pledged hundreds of billions of dollars in asset purchases, saying the epidemic was having a ""profound"" impact on the economy.
Central banks in Japan, Australia and New Zealand followed with their own measures, but could not stem a slide in global stocks. S&P 500 futures fell 4.77% to their daily down limit shortly after resuming trading on Sunday night.
The benchmark European index has now lost more than a third of its value since hitting a record high mid-February, with declines made worse by a crash in oil prices and the European Central Bank's decision to hold interest rates last week.
Latest economic data from China showing factory production plunging at its sharpest pace in 30 years has also re-ignited fears of a global recession as the pandemic paralyses supply chains and crushes business sentiment.
Europe's banks index (SX7P) fell about 9.9%, with French banks  Natixis  (PA:CNAT) and SocGen (PA:SOGN) giving up between 14.1% and 12.6%.

Investing.com - European stock markets traded sharply lower Monday, with moves by the U.S. Federal Reserve overnight to cushion the economic impact of the spread of the coronavirus only reinforcing the sense of impending doom.
At 03:30 ET (0830 GMT), the U.K.'s FTSE index was trading 7.4% lower, France's CAC 40 was down 8.8%, while the DAX was down 7.7%. The pan-eurozone Euro Stoxx 50, dropped 9%. 
The Federal Reserve moved aggressively on Sunday to support a global economy collapsing under the pressure of the coronavirus pandemic, cutting short-term rates to near zero and pledging hundreds of billions of dollars in asset purchases.
Yet these moves have done little to buoy investor confidence when weighed against the latest economic data showing the impact from the virus on the world's second-largest economy. 
China's factory production plunged 13.5% in January-February from the same period a year earlier. That was the weakest reading since January 1990 when Reuters records started, and a sharp reversal of the 6.9% growth in December. 
Retail sales shrank 20.5% on-year, compared with 8% growth in December, while China's jobless rate rose to 6.2% in February, compared with 5.2% in December and the highest since the official records were published.
Although the Chinese economy was first hit, the impact has also been severe on corporate Europe. 
 Fiat  Chrysler (MI:FCHA) said on Monday it was halting production through March 27 at the majority of its plants in Europe due to the coronavirus crisis disrupting the economy. Shares dropped 10%.
The owner of British Airways and easyJet (LON:EZJ), Europe's no.3 and no.4 airlines, said they would cut capacity drastically to try to survive the coronavirus outbreak which has stopped people traveling around the world.
IAG (LON:ICAG), the owner of BA, said it would cut its flying capacity by at least 75% in April and May and its outgoing boss Willie Walsh would defer his retirement. Shares fell 26%.
EasyJet said it could ground the majority of its fleet on a rolling basis, and its chief executive Johan Lundgren called for coordinated government backing to help the aviation industry survive. Shares fell 28%.
Later Monday, European Union finance ministers are set to discuss the impact of the coronavirus and measures to restart their economies. This will take place by video call later Monday rather than in person after France and Spain joined Italy in imposing lockdowns on tens of millions of people.
A focus of discussions is likely to be the European Commission plan unveiled on Friday to boost spending on sectors of the economy hit by the coronavirus and to let EU nations run bigger deficits to help cushion businesses.
Additionally, there will be a Group of Seven teleconference at 1400 GMT to discuss the health crisis.
Oil markets continued to be hammered by both demand and supply shocks Monday. Measures to curtail the advance of the coronavirus have severely limited demand for the product at the same time as oil’s major producers are embarking on a destructive price war.
AT 03:30 AM ET (0830 GMT), U.S. crude futures traded 04.9% lower at $30.54 a barrel and the international benchmark Brent contract fell 6.7% to $31.59.

1324,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 16, 2020 04:16AM ET</span>","Treasuries Soar, S&P 500 Futures Hit Limit-Down: Markets Wrap","(Bloomberg) --
Treasuries surged and U.S. equity futures tumbled at the start of what’s set to be another volatile week as investors respond to a rapidly escalating economic hit from the coronavirus and a massive emergency move by the Federal Reserve to ease policy.
The Stoxx Europe 600 Index sank along with Asian shares, while futures on the S&P 500 Index hit trading limits with a decline of almost 5% following Friday’s huge rebound on Wall Street. Benchmark Treasury yields retreated more than 30 basis points at one point, though bonds in Europe were mixed.
While the Fed and other central banks strengthened efforts to stabilize capital markets and liquidity, investors are also reacting to a rapid deterioration in the global economic outlook.  Nike  Inc (NYSE:NKE). and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). announced mass store closings, and Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said growth next quarter will be weak.
Investors are struggling to manage a rapidly shifting scenario of companies shutting operations, countries sealing borders and central bankers responding with extraordinary moves. The Fed cut its key interest rate by a full percentage point to near zero and said it will boost its bond holdings by $700 billion. The Bank of Japan move to accelerate asset purchases, at least for a time, bringing forward its decision from later this week.
“In normal circumstances, a large policy response like this would put a floor under risk assets and support a recovery,” Jason Daw, a strategist at  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN), wrote in a note. “However, the size of the growth shock is becoming exponential and markets are rightfully questioning what else monetary policy can do and discounting its effectiveness in mitigating coronavirus-induced downside risks.”
The yen rebounded from Friday’s plunge after the Fed and five counterparts also said they would deploy foreign-exchange swap lines. Australian equities fell almost 10%, the most since 1992 even after the Reserve Bank of Australia said it stood ready to buy bonds for the first time -- an announcement that sent yields tumbling. New Zealand’s currency slumped after an emergency rate cut there.
Meantime, China reported Monday that output and retail sales tumbled in the past two months. Oil resumed its trenchant decline.
The moves from policy makers follow the worst rout in equities since the global financial crisis and escalating risks of a recession in major economies. Over the weekend, the U.S. extended its travel ban to more countries and cases continued to surge in Europe, while airlines are taking drastic measures to weather the collapse in travel."

Investing.com - European stock markets are set to open sharply lower Monday, with moves by the U.S. Federal Reserve overnight to cushion the economic impact of the spread of the coronavirus having little success in calming panicking investors.
At 3:25 ET (0725 GMT), the DAX futures contract traded 971 points, or 10% lower. France's CAC 40 futures were down 262 points, or 6.4%, while the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. fell 187 points, or 3.5%. Futures on the pan-eurozone index, the Euro Stoxx 50, dropped 281 points, or 5.3%. 
The Federal Reserve moved aggressively on Sunday to support a global economy collapsing under the pressure of the coronavirus pandemic, cutting short-term rates to a target range of 0% to 0.25%, announcing at least $700 billion in Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities purchases in coming weeks and offering cheap dollar financing to financial institutions around the world facing stress in credit markets.
Yet these moves have done little to buoy investor confidence when weighed against the latest economic data showing the impact from the virus on the world's second-largest economy. 
China's factory production plunged 13.5% in January-February from the same period a year earlier. That was the weakest reading since January 1990 when Reuters records started, and a sharp reversal of the 6.9% growth in December. 
Retail sales shrank 20.5% on-year, compared with 8% growth in December, while China's jobless rate rose to 6.2% in February, compared with 5.2% in December and the highest since the official records were published.
Attention will now turn to Europe, after the Bank of Japan decided to hold steady with its interest rates at its meeting earlier Monday. European Union finance ministers set to discuss the impact of the coronavirus and measures to restart their economies. This will take place by video call later Monday rather than in person after France and Spain joined Italy in imposing lockdowns on tens of millions of people.
A focus of discussions is likely to be the European Commission plan unveiled on Friday to boost spending on sectors of the economy hit by the coronavirus and to let EU nations run bigger deficits to help cushion businesses.
Oil markets continued to be hammered by both demand and supply shocks Monday. Measures to curtail the advance of the coronavirus have severely limited demand for the product at the same time as oil’s major producers are embarking on a destructive price war.
AT 02:00 AM ET (0700 GMT), U.S. crude futures traded 4.5% lower at $30.68 a barrel and the international benchmark Brent contract fell 5.9% to $31.85. 
Additionally, gold futures rose 1.9% to $1,544.95/oz, while EUR/USD traded at 1.1139, up 0.3% on the day."
1327,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 16, 2020 02:56AM ET</span>","Gambling limitations, elderly shopping hours; coronavirus changes business","By Joyce Lee and Brenda Goh
SEOUL/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Apple is taking the temperature of customers at its China stores, Australian grocer Woolworths is providing dedicated shopping hours for the elderly and Samsung will use thermal imaging to vet shareholders at its annual meeting.
Companies across Asia are taking novel and sometimes drastic steps to implement ""social distancing"" measures to try slow the spread of the coronavirus, which has infected more than 170,00 globally and killed more than 6,500.
Australian casino operators, and rivals,  Crown  Resorts (AX:CWN) and Star Entertainment (AX:SGR) announced plans to take half their electronic gaming machines and table offline to ensure their customers got some space.
As well as switching off every second machine, the pair are restricting the number of players at both sitting and stand-up table games.
The potential hit to revenues from the measure, following a downturn in high rollers from China, weighed heavily on their shares. Crown dropped 10.5%, while Star shed a fifth, outpacing a 7.4% fall in the broader market (AXJO).
The casino changes were in line with Australian government advice issued a day earlier that recommended no non-essential gatherings of more than 500 people be held. Australia has recorded more than 250 cases, including Hollywood star Tom Hanks.
Woolworths (AX:WOW), one of the country's two major grocers, introduced a shopping hour for the elderly and those with disabilities.
""This temporary measure will give (the elderly), and those with a disability, the opportunity to shop before ​our stores officially open - helping them obtain the ​essential ​items they need most in a less crowded environment,"" Woolworths Supermarkets Managing Director Claire Peters said.
In South Korea, Samsung Electronics' (KS:005930) on Monday urged shareholders to vote electronically for its annual general meeting later this week, the first time the company has adopted this measure.
The tech giant said there would be thermal cameras and contactless thermometers for those attending the meeting in person and people with symptoms may be restricted from entering. Compatriot SK Hynix (KS:000660), which also holds its AGM this week, plans to seat shareholders about two meters away from each other, a spokesman told Reuters.
In the Philippines, Samuel Matunog, president of ICT Davao an umbrella organization for 56 call center companies, said it had asked agents ""not to hold hands and avoid cheek-to-cheek kisses.""
Community quarantine was implemented in Davao and some other areas in Philippines on Sunday, a move that suspended classes, imposed time-based curfews, and banned drinking in public places.
CHINA EASING
As many countries imposed tougher ""social distancing"" rules, China began easing its own curbs across stores, restaurants and offices after weeks of industry-wide shutdowns.
Apple Inc (O:AAPL) reopened its 42 stores in mainland China while closing others elsewhere in the world, but required customers wear masks and have their temperatures taken upon entry.
An Apple store in one of Shanghai's busiest shopping streets was buzzing on Saturday despite the restrictions, following a slump in sales last month..
The company has also moved its annual developers conference in California in June entirely online.
Workplaces in China have limited lunchtime interactions for employees and restricted the number of people allowed in elevators. Chains including McDonald's (N:MCD) and Starbucks (O:SBUX) ramped up ""contactless"" pickup and delivery services.
Several food delivery companies elsewhere in Asia are adopting the ""zero contact"" approach, including Domino's Pizza (AX:DMP) in Australia and New Zealand, Tencent-backed (HK:0700) Swiggy, and in India, Zomato, backed by Alibaba's (N:BABA) Ant Financial.
""We believe it is possible ... to continue to safely prepare millions of meals for our customers each week, delivering to those who are staying at home, and to provide employment for more than 50,000 team members around the world,"" Domino's CEO Don Meij said."

National Security Council Says Rumors of U.S. Quarantine Fake (12:35 p.m. HK)
The White House National Security Council, in a Twitter post on a verified account, said text-message rumors of a national quarantine “are fake,” adding there’s “no national lockdown.”
There is an ongoing effort to spread misinformation and cause undue panic in the U.S., a senior administration official said. The effort includes text messages with false information being sent to mobile phones across America, the official said.
NYC and LA Close Venues, Limit Restaurants (11:27 a.m. HK)
New York City and Los Angeles said they will close nightclubs and entertainment venues while limiting restaurants and bars to takeout and delivery.
The moves came after New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said the city’s public schools -- encompassing some 1.1 million students -- will close until at least April 20. The city last week declared an emergency, with Broadway theaters going dark and streets and train stations sparsely populated.
The latest announcements capped a steady barrage of unprecedented decisions across American Sunday to help contain the virus, including moves by the governors of Ohio and Illinois to close bars and prohibit dining in restaurants. They followed sweeping restrictions on crowded venues and gatherings imposed earlier by Italy, Spain and France.
Vaccine Trial to Begin, Official Says: AP (11:17 a.m. HK)
The first participant in a clinical trial for a vaccine against the coronavirus will receive an experimental dose on Monday, the Associated Press reported, citing an unidentified government official.

White House Urges Telework for DC-Area Federal Workers (9:58 a.m. HK)
The White House is asking all federal agencies to offer “maximum telework flexibilities” to their employees in the Washington area, citing concerns about the coronavirus.
“The Administration wants to ensure that department and agency leaders assertively safeguard the health and safety of their workforce while remaining open to serve the American people and conduct mission critical functions,” the White House Office of Management and Budget said in a memo to department heads and agencies Sunday night.
While the memo stops short of ordering federal employees to work from home, it appears to greenlight the idea for workers in the DC metro area.
Qantas, United Plan to Cut More Flights (9:42 a.m. HK)
Qantas Airways Ltd. plans a fourth set of capacity cuts after a global clampdown on travel accelerated and Australia said anyone arriving from overseas must isolate themselves to limit the spread of the coronavirus.

West Virginia remained the only state without a reported case.
The growth rate of the virus escalated in March -- cases roughly doubled every few days at the epicenters in Washington, California and New York. That growth reflects a mix of new transmissions and increased testing capacity.
State officials reported the first California cases in late January, and since then, the count has ballooned. On Feb. 2 there were 6 cases, and today the state had 335, according to the California Department of Public Health.
California Asks Seniors to Isolate (6:50 a.m. HK)

More Tests to Produce ‘Spike,’ Aide Says (6:30 a.m. HK)
An expansion of U.S. testing for the virus will result in a “spike in the curve” in the next week as more cases are uncovered, a top White House aide said.
“For those of you who watched China, and China reporting, remember when they changed their definition and all of a sudden there was a blip in their curve? We are going to see that,” Deborah Birx, virus response coordinator, said at a briefing of the coronavirus task force. “We are going to see a spike as more and more people have access” to the tests.
Many local governments have announced measures to press “social distancing” as a way to “flatten the curve” -- shorthand for slowing new cases enough so as not to overwhelm hospitals.
Czech Republic in Quarantine (6:20 a.m. HK)
The Czech government imposed a nationwide quarantine to prevent further spread of the coronavirus by limiting the movement of people, Prime Minister Andrej Babis said in Prague. The lockdown will be in place until March 24.
Exempted from the order: travel to and from work, necessary family visits or medical appointments.
Drive-Through Tests in Place (5:30 p.m. NY)
Vice President Mike Pence said 10 U.S. states have now implemented their own drive-through coronavirus testing, a step that can speed detection of the spreading illness.
Pence, at a White House briefing, said testing is available in all 50 states and 2,000 laboratories will be online by Monday. The priority will be testing health-care workers and first responders, followed by people over age 65 with coughs, fever or other symptoms, he said.
The Trump administration will brief state governors on Monday, the vice president said.
Trump Discourages Hoarding (5:15 p.m. NY)
President Donald Trump said Americans should buy fewer groceries as retailers struggle to keep food and other products in stock because of concern over the spread of coronavirus.
“There’s no need for anybody in the country to hoard essential food supplies,” Trump told reporters at the White House. “You don’t have to buy the quantities because it’s hard to refill the stores.”
Trump added: “Relax. We’re doing great. It all will pass.”
The president earlier spoke with executives of grocery chains and food producers and said they told him people are buying three to five times as much as they normally do. Companies on the call included Walmart (NYSE:WMT), Whole Foods,  Target  (NYSE:TGT) and  General Mills  (NYSE:GIS), among others.

NYC to Close Schools (5 p.m. NY)
New York City schools will close this week, Governor Andrew Cuomo announced. Schools in Westchester, Nassau and Suffolk Counties will close tomorrow, and city schools will close later in the week, said Melissa DeRosa, secretary to the governor.
All the localities must provide food programs to those now receiving them, and childcare to essential workers. City officials must have a plan in place within 24 hours, DeRosa said.
Spain-Portugal Border Shut (4:30 p.m. NY)
Portugal and Spain will close their border to tourists, Portuguese Prime Minister Antonio Costa said. The border will remain open for goods and for cross-border workers. Costa said he expects the measure can take effect Monday and continue for more than a month to include the Easter holidays.
The Portuguese have voluntarily limited their movement and social contact, so it’s not necessary to adopt tougher lock-down measures, Costa said.
Travel Limits Roil Airports (3:15 p.m. NY)
Chicago’s O’Hare International Airport was among facilities overwhelmed this weekend with passengers, including many coming from Europe, who faced new screening measures.

New Zealand Cuts Rates (3 p.m. NY)
The New Zealand central bank slashed its benchmark interest rate by 75 basis points as strict border controls look set to tip the economy into recession. In an emergency move, the Reserve Bank cut its cash rate to 0.25% from 1% and said it will remain there for at least the next 12 months.
South Africa Declares Disaster (2 p.m. NY)
South Africa declared a national state of disaster, closed 35 ports of entry, banned gatherings of more than 100 people and shut schools starting the middle of this week. Flights will be halted from Italy, Iran, the U.S., U.K. and South Korea, the government said.

Europe is reporting more new cases each day than China did when the disease peaked in that country, the head of the World Health Organization said. Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus also said canceling sporting events can help slow the spread.
The situation will worsen in many countries before it improves, said Maria Van Kerkhove, a WHO epidemiologist. While the situation is improving in Asia, countries where the disease has peaked could experience relapses, she said.
Dutch Schools, Bars to Close (1:15 p.m. NY)
The Dutch government ordered schools, gyms, restaurants and bars to close until April 6. Suspending classes puts the Netherlands in line with most other European countries, though it’s a reversal from Prime Minister Mark Rutte’s insistence last week that schools will stay open.
Manhattan Project Approach Urged (12:20 p.m. NY)
U.S. hospitals are preparing for a surge in patients as testing becomes more prevalent, revealing the extent of Covid-19’s spread, which led one administrator to urge more action.
“We need to think about this in almost like a war-like stance,” Peter Slavin, president of Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”
He urged the government to wage a Manhattan Project-type effort, as it did in World War II on the atomic bomb, to spur the health-care industry to make more surgical masks, eye protection gear and gowns.

1330,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 16, 2020 12:22AM ET</span>",Exclusive: U.S. prosecutors believe Credit Suisse is culpable in Mozambique scandal - sources,"By Koh Gui Qing
NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. prosecutors are investigating  Credit Suisse  Group AG's (S:CSGN) role in a $2 billion Mozambique corruption case and believe they have evidence of the Swiss lender’s culpability after three former bankers pleaded guilty last year, according to two sources familiar with the matter.
Prosecutors believe Credit Suisse can be held criminally liable for its employees' crimes if they were committed in the scope of their role and at least partly benefited the bank, said one of the sources who is a U.S. law enforcement official. They believe a plea deal and testimonies from two former bankers at a subsequent trial give them evidence of the bank’s culpability, the sources said.
Prosecutors from the Eastern District of New York contacted the bank in February and laid out their initial case against it, the second source said.
""Credit Suisse continues to cooperate with all investigating authorities,"" a Credit Suisse spokesman said.
The prosecutor’s view on the bank’s culpability and the latest contact between prosecutors and the bank have not been previously reported.
It is not clear whether prosecutors will file any charges against the bank. The second source said talks between prosecutors and Credit Suisse could go on for as long as a year and the bank, which disputes that testimonies from its former bankers proved its guilt, may fight any charges in court.
The Justice Department declined to comment. The two sources declined to be named due to sensitivity of the matter.
The case stems from loans Credit Suisse helped arrange between 2013 and 2016 to develop Mozambique's coastal defenses, shipping fleet and tuna fishing industry.
The three former Credit Suisse bankers, along with two middlemen and three Mozambican government officials, were charged in 2018 for money laundering and defrauding U.S. investors who had invested in the loans. U.S. prosecutors said at least $200 million of the loans had been diverted to the eight defendants. The former bankers pleaded guilty last year.
One of the former bankers, Andrew Pearse, who was a managing director, said during his plea hearing that he had accepted millions of dollars of unlawful kickbacks to enrich himself and Credit Suisse, according to a court transcript. The bank earned $24 million in fees on the loans, but is still waiting for Mozambique to repay a $270 million portion of the loan, one of the sources said.
A second former Credit Suisse banker who pleaded guilty testified at the trial of one of the middlemen that the bank was aware that the value of the ships financed through the loans were false, the sources familiar with the matter said.
The banker testified during a cross-examination that the bank failed to notify investors after learning that boats it had financed were worth about $250 million and $400 million less than it had originally indicated on the loan, said the law enforcement official. 

However, the second source said such disclosures are usually made by the issuer, which in this case is the Mozambican government, and the bank is of the view that its former bankers were not senior enough to prove failure on the part of the lender.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The United States' biggest banks will stop buying back their own shares, and will instead use that capital to lend to individuals and businesses affected by the coronavirus, an industry trade group said on Sunday.
The Financial Services Forum said its eight members - JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM), Bank of America Corp (N:BAC),  Citigroup  Inc (N:C),  Wells Fargo  & Co (N:WFC),  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS),  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS), Bank of New York Mellon Corp (N:BK) and  State Street  Corp (N:STT) - would each halt share repurchases through June 30.
""The COVID-19 pandemic is an unprecedented challenge for the world and the global economy and the largest U.S. banks have an unquestioned ability and commitment to supporting our customers, clients and the nation,"" the group said in a statement, referring to a severe and sometimes fatal respiratory infection that stems from the coronavirus.
The decision follows pressure from some U.S. lawmakers, who last week urged big banks to stop using funds to repurchase shares and instead support customers and the broader economy.
It also comes within hours of the U.S. Federal Reserve slashing interest rates further and Wall Street's home city, New York, detailing plans to close schools and senior centers, and toughen enforcement of restrictions on bars and restaurants.
Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said on a call with reporters the Fed has given broad general guidance to the banks to ""use their buffers to provide loans and also to work with their borrowers.""
""We hear the banks saying that is exactly what they are going to do, so that's a good thing,"" Powell said.
The Financial Services Forum said its 8 member banks have grown their collective capital by more than 40% in the last decade to $914 billion.
""(It is) our collective objective to use our significant capital and liquidity to provide maximum support to individuals, small businesses, and the broader economy through lending and other important services,"" according to the group's statement.
The group said the banks' decision was consistent with actions by the Fed, the White House and Congress, and that every bank is free to re-start share repurchases before June 30 if circumstances change.
JPMorgan, the largest U.S. bank, said in a separate statement that it will use the extra funds to support lending to individuals, business owners and governments, and add liquidity in capital markets, ""even if circumstances get dramatically worse."""
1334,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 15, 2020 07:16PM ET</span>",New Zealand's corporate world hit by coronavirus outbreak,"(Reuters) - The fast-spreading coronavirus has shaken the corporate world in New Zealand, with a growing number of companies suspending their earnings outlooks, and others reeling from the economic unknowns facing them.
The country's central bank stunned markets by slashing its official cash rate early on Monday morning. It said the impact from the virus on the economy was, and would remain, significant.
Shortly afterwards and adding to the list of firms forced to suspend their earnings forecasts, Auckland International Airport (NZ:AIA) and  Serko  Ltd (NZ:SKO) did so, pointing to the stringent border controls imposed by New Zealand over the weekend.
The extreme measures, which Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said were needed to prevent the rapid spread of the virus, requires all incoming travelers, including New Zealand citizens, to self-isolate for two weeks starting from midnight on Sunday.
There are so far eight confirmed cases of the coronavirus in New Zealand.
Companies highly exposed to travel and tourism have been hit hard.
Air New Zealand (NZ:AIR), which withdrew its full-year guidance last week, further slashed capacity on Monday and said it was looking to lay off some permanent staff. Its directors also agreed to a 15% pay cut until the end of the year.
""These are unprecedented times,"" said the airline's chief executive officer, Greg Foran.
 Tourism  Holdings Ltd (NZ:THL) said there ""are too many uncertainties"" to keep its profit forecast. Investor Good Spirits Hospitality (NZ:GSH) withdrew its 2020 earnings guidance on Monday.
The world's biggest dairy exporter, Fonterra (NZ:FSF) (NZ:FCG) will report half-year results on Wednesday and its outlook will be closely watched.
The New Zealand Exchange said companies must ""promptly"" disclose if the coronavirus was having any material financial or operating impact.

The task force, which would be focusing on areas including vehicle production plans, is being headed by UAW President Rory Gamble, GM Chief Executive Officer Mary Barra, Ford CEO Jim Hackett, Ford Executive Chairman Bill Ford and FCA CEO Michael Manley, the parties said in a joint statement on Sunday.
Though automakers typically schedule plant staffing to allow for a certain proportion of absent workers, according to industry consultants, if the outbreak causes higher levels due to infection or workers staying home to care for children whose schools are closed, that could lead to reduced production or in extreme cases shutdowns.
Production at an FCA assembly plant in Canada was halted for 24 hours after employees there refused to work on Thursday over fears of an employee being possibly exposed to the coronavirus.
Separately on Thursday, the Italian-American automaker said that one of its employees had tested positive for COVID-19, a respiratory disease caused by the new coronavirus, at its transmission plant in Indiana. The plant, however, remained open.
""This is a fluid and unprecedented situation, and the task force will move quickly to build on the wide-ranging preventive measures we have put in place,"" the CEOs of the three companies said in the statement.
The task force would also be focusing on aspects such as health and safety education, health screening, food service at the automakers' locations."

1337,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 15, 2020 05:42PM ET</span>","In America’s Great Shutdown, You’ll Need to Pour Your Own Drink","(Bloomberg) -- It’s already being dubbed the Great Shutdown.
From Colorado’s ski resorts to New York’s Momofuku restaurants and the Grand Canyon National Park’s daily informational film showings, America is closing down at an unprecedented speed to curb the deadly coronavirus.
Across the U.S., hundreds of business owners and local governments have canceled events and shuttered venues, with bars, restaurants and retailers now following the lead of stadiums, colleges and Broadway theaters. The closures echo the sweeping restrictions on crowded venues and gatherings imposed by Italy, Spain and France -- dramatic measures for nations known for their out-and-about lifestyles. And it’s not just a big-city phenomenon.
“We made the decision to shut it down for public safety, knowing that our governor hadn’t imposed any restrictions yet, but we felt it was the right thing to do,” said Mark Altemeier, who along with wife Amy owns the Monkey Bar & Grille in the Cincinnati suburb of Mainesville, Ohio. The couple broke the news to patrons on March 13.
The pub, set along the Little Miami River and named for an infamous cigarette-smoking chimp called Sam who entertained bar-dwellers there decades ago, can pack in 400 to 500 people on weekends. Amy Altemeier said Sunday she had expected as many as 2,000 revelers to filter through for this week’s St. Patrick’s Day festivities.
Governor Mike DeWine said later that he would order all bars and restaurants in Ohio to close starting at 9 p.m., adding that venues can stay open for carry-out and delivery. “What we can’t have is people congregating and seated,” he wrote on Twitter. In Illinois, Governor J.B. Pritzker imposed a similar order, from March 16 to March 30.
Health experts for weeks have pushed the idea that social isolation -- whether voluntary or mandatory -- is the only way to come to grips with the highly contagious virus that’s infected more than 160,000 people worldwide and led to 6,000 deaths, including more than 60 in the U.S. While only a small share of those infected end up needing hospital care, the speed and magnitude of the virus’s spread can overwhelm hospitals, as happened in China and Italy.
While the Monkey Bar might have been a couple of days ahead of Ohio’s governor in ringing its temporary last call, it’s clear that tightly packed drinking establishments are in the crosshairs of public health officials. Chicago had already ordered venues that serve alcohol to operate at half their maximum capacity. In the nation’s capital, officials put an end to bar seating, ordered tables to be pushed 6 feet apart, and shut down nightclubs.
“I would like to see a dramatic diminution of the personal interaction that we see in restaurants and bars,” Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told CNN on Sunday. “Whatever it takes to do that, that’s what I’d like to see.”
Sorry, We’re Closed
Few types of venue are being spared -- including outdoor spaces. In Miami, which at this time of year is filled with college students on spring break, some beaches were closing early and concerts were suspended.
In Colorado, Governor Jared Polis ordered the shutdown of all ski areas for a week, shortly after Vail Resorts Inc. suspended operations of its North American mountain resorts and retail stores through March 22. In Arizona, Grand Canyon National Park remains open but South Rim restaurants were far emptier than usual, and ranger programs and showings of the park film were canceled.
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo pointedly stopped short on Sunday of ordering closed schools or private businesses to close, even as he urged businesses to voluntarily shutter or have people work from home.
“We can only maintain public health by STAYING APART,” Cuomo tweeted on Sunday. “The decision each of makes now will impact us all tomorrow. STAY HOME.”
Many businesses are heeding such calls. Urban Outfitters Inc (NASDAQ:URBN). said Saturday it would close all stores until at least March 28. On Sunday, Abercrombie & Fitch followed, but said its stores in the Asia-Pacific region will remain open. On Monday,  Nike  Inc (NYSE:NKE). will close all its shops in the U.S., Canada, Western Europe, Australia and New Zealand through March 27.
Open, for Now
While large national or global businesses may have the resources to temporarily close stores, some small businesses are trying novel approaches to stay afloat.
Modo Yoga, with 70 studios North America, Europe and Australia, has begun streaming free classes over Instagram, encouraging users to support them by chipping in a few dollars via Venmo or PayPal.
“We’re hanging on for dear life,” said Steve Vernetti, owner of Vernetti’s, a self-financed mom-and-pop Italian restaurant on Larchmont Boulevard in Los Angeles that counts Mayor Eric Garcetti among its regulars. “Next week I’m going to write a letter to my landlord begging him to reduce the rent. We have exorbitant costs. Business is down 75%.”
And creative workarounds aren’t just happening in the secular world: In Sugar Land, Texas, The Bridge church closed its doors, asking worshippers to participate in services online through March 29. Sugar Land is in Fort Bend County, which has nine confirmed or presumed cases of coronavirus.
Some businesses that chose to stay open are actually riding a bit of a wave. Richard Falco, a host and server at pizzeria Johnny Pepperoni in Hoboken, New Jersey, said the restaurant had more pick-up and delivery orders than typical on March 14. And the Emerald Fields cannabis dispensary in Glendale, Colorado, is holding tight, armed with sanitizer to handle increased traffic. Customers are a little panicky, said one employee.
For now, the shutdowns in the U.S. are less severe than in parts of Europe. Italy began a nationwide lockdown Monday. This weekend, Spanish authorities banned citizens from leaving their homes except for work or to buy essential supplies or medicines. And the French government shut down all restaurants, cafes, cinemas and nonessential retail shops.
Yet even Americans who shy away from cable news, Twitter or newspapers likely won’t be able to escape the myriad encouragements to avoid their fellow humans.
“Hands clean 2 beat Covid-19,” read an electronic message board next to State Highway 288 in Houston. A short while later, there was another: “Give xtra space with each other and on the road.”

1338,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 15, 2020 05:41PM ET</span>",Factories shift operations in scramble to restock supermarket shelves,"By Melissa Fares and Lisa Baertlein
NEW YORK/LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - With supermarkets stripped of food and many other essentials, consumer product companies halted factory runs of niche items such as scented bleach in order to speed up production of more basic merchandise that is in high demand.
Brick-and-mortar retailers have warned that hoarding toilet paper, cleaning supplies and food staples was fueling shortages. Amazon.com (O:AMZN), the biggest online retailer, said it sold out of many household staples after orders spiked.
As the fast-spreading coronavirus continues to alarm consumers across Europe and the United States, Trump held a phone call on Sunday with 30 executives from grocery stores including Amazon.com's Whole Foods,  Target  Corp (N:TGT), Costco Wholesale Corp (O:COST) and Walmart Inc (N:WMT). Trump Administration official Larry Kudlow assured television news viewers that U.S. supply lines were ""working pretty well.""
""The grocery supply chain is not going to shut down,"" said Doug Baker, who leads crisis management for the Food Marketing Institute (FMI), the trade group representing food retailers and wholesalers.
That does not mean that every product and Doritos chip flavor will be on store shelves.
As factories move to round-the-clock operations, they are focusing on the highest priority items to address the unprecedented surge in demand, said Baker.
For example, rather than cranking out bleach in several different sizes and scents, they will limit production to the most popular. Exotic flavors of certain foods may also be halted. That saves times because machines have to be changed to produce a different product.
""Manufacturers have also started allocating goods so they can ensure equal distribution across the country,"" Baker said.
U.S. retail giants such as Walmart Inc, Publix and  Kroger Co  (N:KR) have set restrictions on purchases of toilet paper, Lysol sanitizing wipes and other in-demand products.
Walmart, which gets more than half its U.S. revenue from grocery sales, has given store managers authorization to manage their inventory, ""including the discretion to limit sales quantities on items that are in unusually high demand,"" a spokesperson said.
Walmart's replenishment efforts include ""diverting products to areas of the country where they are needed most and routing deliveries directly to stores,"" the spokesperson said.
Retailers are reducing hours to give harried employees time to restock and deep clean stores after frantic shoppers swarm shelves.
Companies across the grocery sector are working to ensure that they have enough labor to keep supplies moving. At least 62 have people have died from coronavirus infections in the United States, where infections are expected to rise from the currently confirmed 3,000 cases.
Baker, from FMI, said contingency plans include shifting workers from restaurant supply chain jobs as cities begin imposing curfews and ""social distancing measures"" such as barring sit-down dining.
Kroger - the largest U.S. supermarket operator with chains including Ralphs and Harris Teeter - put out a call for workers on Sunday.
""We have immediate positions available combined across our retail stores, manufacturing plants and distribution centers,"" a Kroger spokeswoman said in an email.
""This pressure – coming across the entire nation – is fundamentally different than regional emergencies that have been dealt with in the past,"" said Hilding Anderson, head of retail strategy at consulting firm Publicis Sapient.
Meanwhile, the hunt for sought-after goods continues.
Donna El-Armale, 53, turned out in the predawn hours to line up at a Costco Wholesale Corp (O:COST) superstore in Los Angeles.
""We're just trying to get our normal two-week supply,"" said El-Armale, whose shopping list included paper towels and water for herself, and toilet paper for a family member.
El-Armale, a therapist, waited patiently with dozens of other shoppers who had lined up carts in the parking lot. Like many Los Angeles-area shoppers, who have weathered earthquakes and riots, she expected life to go on.
""We know the stores will be open,"" she said."

""We too have seen an increasing number of confirmed infections in our operations and central areas in recent days,"" the memo, seen by Reuters on Sunday, said.

HOUSTON (Reuters) - Major energy companies in the United States imposed work-from-home rules for office staff and began health checks for remote or critical workers as coronavirus spread and threatened an industry reeling from falling demand and profits. 
 BP  (LON:BP),  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM),  Kinder Morgan , Motiva Enterprises and Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) told most office staff to work from home starting Monday. Federal regulators on Friday were pressed by companies to ease work rules for pipeline operators and to limit visits to some sites. Shell and  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) began health checks of workers and visitors at some key U.S. facilities, spokesmen said.
Offshore rigs, refineries and pipelines require on-site teams and group workers in close quarters, making them vulnerable in a Covid-19 outbreak. They cannot be run remotely and health checks could prevent forced shutdowns that could lead to big losses or local fuel shortages. 
The pandemic has infected more than 156,000 people worldwide including some 2,900 people in the United States, killed more than 5,800 globally and slashed fuel demand amid shuttered schools, churches, offices and some retail stores.
There is only one known case of Covid-19 to hit a U.S. refinery. Marathon Petroleum Corp (NYSE:MPC), the nation's largest refiner by capacity, removed some staff at a California plant after an employee became ill. Norwegian oil firm Equinor halted a North Sea development project and removed staff after an offshore worker fell ill.
STORM-LIKE PREPARATIONS
Falling oil demand and a price-war that slashed crude prices by about 50% this year has put the industry in a tailspin. Many oil firms have abruptly cut spending and staff to cope with the downturn.
Work-at-home rules, fewer car and plane trips are expected to reduce U.S. petroleum demand by up to 2.5 million barrels per day (bpd). For the full year, it could cut motor fuel use by roughly 300,000 to 400,000 bpd. 
There have been no refining or chemical plant shut-ins caused by coronavirus. Still, companies are drafting plans similar to hurricane measures that keep plants running with minimal staff, said people familiar with operations. 
Shell asked salaried staff at its Louisiana refineries to begin shadowing hourly plant operators to prepare managers to run units if necessary, the people said. 
Exxon will allow only trained operators into control rooms at its Baytown plant, and they must remain at least six feet apart from one another, they added.
Pipeline regulators discussed work-rules for control room operators and visits by U.S. and state inspectors with trade group executives on Friday, said Suzanne Lemieux, an emergency expert at trade group American Petroleum Institute. 
SWEEPING PRECAUTIONS 
BP and Shell on Friday gave workers work-at-home assignments following similar social-distancing measures at Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), and Microsoft's Silicon Valley offices. The rules affect about 15,000 U.S. Shell workers. 
Shell has begun screening staff who travel to its U.S. Gulf of Mexico production rigs ""to ensure that we minimize the risks of COVID-19 transmission"" to offshore workers, said spokesman Curtis Smith.
The sweeping precautions affect refinery, oil and gas export terminal and gas pipeline operations. Kinder Morgan Inc (NYSE:KMI), one of the largest North American pipeline firms, asked most of its 11,000 employees to work from home beginning Monday. It will reevaluate the situation weekly, said spokeswoman Melissa Ruiz. 
Non-essential workers at BP's U.S. refineries, Exxon’s Baytown, Texas, refinery and Shell’s Convent and Norco, Louisiana, plants also will work from home beginning Monday, according to people familiar with the matter. BP may keep the measures through mid-April, one of the people said. 
Exxon would not comment on specific actions. It is focused ""on ensuring the safety and health of our entire workforce and to do our part to limit the spread,"" said spokesman Todd Spitler.
Marathon Petroleum launched ""business-continuity plans to accommodate staffing needs in the event of illness-related absenteeism,” spokesman Jamal Kheiry said. 
Among measures being weighed at refineries are assigning small crews to keep plants during an outbreak, the people said. Crews would not leave until the crisis passed. 
Most refineries can operate with about half their normal staff, the people said, but may have to scale back production.
Refiners  LyondellBasell Industries  (NYSE:LYB) and Chevron are considering health checks for employees as they begin their workday, said people familiar with the deliberations.
""We are taking precautionary measures to reduce the risk of exposure, including screening workers and visitors,"" Chevron spokesman Braden Reddall said. Local offices will set their own rules with health officials, he added.

(Reuters) - Delta Air Lines Inc (NYSE:DAL) said Sunday it will halt service to London from Detroit and Dublin flights from New York after the White House announced it was imposing new travel restrictions on United Kingdom and Ireland.
The second-largest U.S. airline has slashed its trans-Atlantic schedule and will be flying just five flights a day to Europe starting this week, compared with 92 last year to 31 European destinations at the peak travel season.
Delta said starting Monday it will only fly once a day roundtrip from Atlanta to Amsterdam, London-Heathrow, Paris-Charles De Gaulle and one flight daily from Detroit to Amsterdam and New York-JFK to London-Heathrow. The White House said Saturday that effective at midnight Monday most non-U.S. citizens who have been in the UK or Ireland within the last 14 days will be barred from entering the United States.
Delta announced it was dramatically cutting European flights on Friday and cutting its entire schedule by 40% in the coming months after U.S. President Donald Trump announced the travel restrictions on continental Europe on Wednesday night that were then expanded Saturday.
Delta chief executive Ed Bastian said in a memo to employees Friday the ""speed of the demand fall-off is unlike anything we’ve seen... We are moving quickly to preserve cash and protect our company. And with revenues dropping, we must be focused on taking costs out of our business.""
Delta, American Air Lines and United Airlines, the three largest U.S. airlines, confirmed Friday they in talks with the U.S. government about potential assistance amid a dramatic drop-off in air travel demand due to the coronavirus outbreak. Administration official said Saturday they want Congress to provide assistance to airlines and other industries badly harmed by the travel demand collapse.
American said Saturday it would cancel 75% of its international flights and ground nearly all its widebody jets.

(Reuters) - With one of Wall Street's wildest weeks in recent memory now in the history books, investors are bracing for more uncertainty and big market swings ahead. 
Overwhelmingly, caution remains the watchword for investors and analysts reeling from a week that saw all three U.S. exchanges confirm bear markets, oil prices plummet to multiyear lows and wild fluctuations in bond yields and currencies. (N)
Investors still have little clarity on the possible trajectory of the coronavirus outbreak in the United States, the effectiveness of the government response and the eventual damage the virus will cause to the nation's economy and individual companies. 
Many are awaiting the start of trading in U.S. stock futures on Sunday night, a session that has proven volatile in recent weeks. 
""Right now, we view investing in the current environment using the hackneyed phrase of 'catching a falling knife,'"" said Richard Bernstein, chief executive of Richard Bernstein Advisors in a note to investors and conference call. ""We see no need to rush into markets.""
Bernstein said the rush into U.S. government bonds sparked by recent market swings has overstretched the prices of Treasuries, which now sport yields near record lows. His portfolio holds shorter-dated U.S. debt and equities in the consumer staples and health care sectors, among others. 
The White House on Saturday said it would extend a travel ban to include the United Kingdom and Ireland, a move that could further hurt oil prices and airlines already battered by a ban announced last week. 
Analytics firm Oxford Economics also discouraged dip buyers, noting in a report that companies' price-to-earnings ratios remain elevated and corporations may eventually find it difficult to service their debt at a time when leverage is near all-time highs. The firm urged investors to trim exposure to a broad variety of asset classes, including European stocks and the local currency debt of emerging markets. 
They are also warning investors to brace for more alarming headlines concerning the virus' spread in the United States.
""In the foreseeable future, and with a vaccine for the virus still nowhere in sight, it is reasonable to assume that Western containment strategies are unlikely to succeed and the peak in the incidence is at least some weeks, if not months, away,"" the firm said.
Others are continuing to watch for signs of stresses across markets. 
Analysts at Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) wrote that the Federal Reserve may announce measures on Sunday night aimed at bolstering liquidity in the commercial paper market, used by companies for short-term loans.
The measures, if taken, would be aimed at buffering the market ahead of potentially large outflows from money market funds in coming days, the Bank of America analysts wrote. 
The United States has in recent days received a taste of the types of disruptions that the virus has wrought in other countries, including Italy and South Korea. 
Daily routines have been upended as businesses including Amazon.com (O:AMZN) urge employees to work from home, schools and universities close, and sporting events and church services are paused across the country. In response to the run on certain items, major retailers have imposed some purchase limits.
""Americans should be prepared that they are going to have to hunker down significantly more than we as a country are doing,"" Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious diseases expert, said on NBC's ""Meet the Press"" on Sunday. With limited testing available, officials have recorded nearly 3,000 cases and 59 deaths in the United States.
Investors have cheered moves by the Federal Reserve to add liquidity to markets and promises of fiscal support from the U.S. government, with markets ripping higher on Friday as President Donald Trump declared a national emergency. 
U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told ""Fox News Sunday"" the cost of a coronavirus aid package will likely be ""significant but not huge.""
The Fed is expected to announce an interest rate cut of at least three quarters of a percentage point this week, with financial markets predicting the Fed will be forced to cut to zero by April to boost the economy.
Some investors are looking for value in the wake of the market's big drop.
Analysts at BTIG believe the time is right to step in to some of the market's hardest-hit areas including financial stocks, which they said could benefit from lower interest rates. 
Retail investors appear to be somewhat more optimistic than their institutional counterparts, a poll by wealth management research firm Spectrem Group showed. 
Fewer than 10% of investors polled by the firm earlier this month sold equities while 17% purchased stocks in the recent selloff, the poll showed. 
""This infers that institutional investors are causing the market volatility rather than retail investors,"" the firm said in a report. 
Meanwhile, business owners saw the coronavirus as a serious threat to the economy, a survey from Wilmington Trust showed.

Thirty-six percent of the respondents in the survey, which targeted owners with businesses generating more than $5 million in revenue, said they anticipated reducing employment levels in the first half and 39% said they would cut back capital expenditures.

British Airways, part of International Consolidated Airlines Group (L:ICAG), had warned on Friday of the threat posed by the coronavirus which has grounded flights worldwide.
Things worsened over the weekend as holiday destinations such as Spain declared a state of emergency and the Trump administration added Britain and Ireland to its list of countries facing travel curbs.
""The time for action is now,"" said Airlines UK, a trade body for airlines with UK-registered operations, whose members include British Airways, Virgin Atlantic, Norwegian and Ryanair.
""We're talking about the future of UK aviation - one of our world-class industries - and unless government pulls itself together who knows what will be left of it once we get out of this mess,"" it added.
The chairman of Virgin Group, the majority shareholder in airline Virgin Atlantic, is expected to ask the government for as much as 7.5 billion pounds ($9.2 billion) to prop up the industry, Sky News reported.
The government has been meeting airline industry leaders and further discussions are expected this week.
""We recognize how difficult the current situation is for the aviation sector and, across government, we are engaging with the sector’s leadership to support workers, businesses and passengers,"" a government spokesman said.
CALLS FOR HELP
Coronavirus has slashed demand, prompting airlines to cancel flights and cut costs and ask governments and regulators for help as they battle to get to grips with what they hope will be short-term, rather than long-term, disruption.
In the United States, Delta Air Lines (N:DAL), American Airlines (O:AAL) and United Airlines (O:UAL), the three largest U.S. carriers, said on Friday there were in talks with the U.S. government about potential assistance.
German airline group Lufthansa (DE:LHAG) said on Friday it would ask several European governments for liquidity help to counter the effects of the coronavirus crisis.
The appeal for assistance from some of the world's largest carriers highlights the dramatic upheaval in the airline industry amid the spread of the virus, with the head of British Airways calling it the industry's worst crisis, surpassing 9/11.
U.S. carriers have traditionally accused foreign rivals, particularly in the Gulf, of benefiting from state support, while some foreign rivals say big U.S. airlines have benefited from takeover protections and Chapter 11 bankruptcy laws.
But IAG Chief Executive Willie Walsh told a conference in early March that struggling airlines should not be given state aid to enable them to survive the drop in demand."

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's food retailers appealed to shoppers on Sunday to stop panic buying during the coronavirus outbreak, saying purchasing more than they need would mean others will be left without.
The British Retail Consortium (BRC), which represents supermarket groups, said retailers had come together to write to their customers, calling on them to be considerate in the way they shop.
The letter, signed by  Tesco  (L:TSCO), Sainsbury's (L:SBRY), Asda (N:WMT), Morrisons (L:MRW), Aldi, Lidl, Coop, Waitrose, M&S (L:MKS), Iceland, Ocado (L:OCDO) and Costcutter, was published in adverts in national newspapers on Sunday. 
""We understand your concerns but buying more than is needed can sometimes mean that others will be left without. There is enough for everyone if we all work together,"" the letter said. 
Social media has been awash over the last week with pictures of empty shelves in Britain's major supermarkets, with items like dried pasta, toilet rolls and canned food particularly sought after.
Britain's Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the government was confident that food supplies were secure, but everybody had to act responsibly as part of a national effort.
""If you are buying food for instance and loo roll you buy what you need, because there's an impact on others,"" he told BBC's Andrew Marr program on Sunday.
Trading in British supermarkets has been intense, with some shop bosses saying it can only be compared to the pre-Christmas rush.
Anecdotal evidence suggested activity had stepped-up further since Thursday when Prime Minister Boris Johnson said those showing even mild symptoms of having the virus should self-isolate for at least seven days.
As of Saturday, 21 people had died after testing positive for COVID-19 in Britain, health authorities said. 
The food retailers said in the letter they were working closely with government and suppliers to keep food moving quickly through the system and making more deliveries to stores to ensure shelves were stocked.
They also said retailers with online delivery and click-and-collect services were running at full capacity.

Tesco Chairman John Allan said on Thursday it was unlikely the retailer, which has a 27.2% share of the British grocery market, would experience anything worse than ""very short term, temporary"" shortages of certain products.

WASHINGTON/CHICAGO (Reuters) - American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) Inc said Saturday it plans to cut 75% of its international flights through May 6 and ground nearly all its widebody fleet, as airlines respond to the global collapse in travel demand due to the coronavirus pandemic.
The dramatic announcement by the largest U.S. airline came hours after the White House said the United States would widen new travel restrictions on Europeans to include travelers in the United Kingdom and Ireland, starting Monday night.
The Trump administration also signaled Saturday it wanted Congress to quickly back financial support for troubled U.S. airlines.
American's sweeping cuts include suspending nearly all long-haul international flights to Asia, Australia, Europe, New Zealand and South America.
It will still operate two flights a day to London and just three flights to Asia per week -- to Tokyo. It will continue short-haul international flying. 
American confirmed it is parking nearly all widebody aircraft and anticipates its domestic capacity will be reduced by 20% in April and 30% in May versus the same period in 2019. 
United Airlines Co said late Saturday it would begin cutting flights to the United Kingdom, Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) moved toward flight cuts and Delta Airlines (NYSE:DAL) Inc plans to start cutting flights to the United Kingdom.
Southwest, one of the few U.S. airlines still flying a full schedule, said it was ""seriously considering"" cutting flights.
While airlines scrambled to stem losses and protect jobs, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the government would ""immediately"" start working with Congress to support the airline and cruise industries, both hard hit by the spiraling crisis.
U.S. Vice President Mike Pence said restrictions on the UK and Ireland will begin Monday at midnight, barring most non-U.S. citizens from entering the United States who have been in those countries within the last 14 days.
They do not bar flights to and from the United States, and Americans and permanent residents can still travel.
United said it would suspend flights to London from Houston and Denver starting Monday. United said it expects to fly three daily flights to London and one daily flight to Dublin through the end of April.
United said it would give a credit for the value of the ticket for any customer whose international travel is disrupted by more than six hours because of schedule changes resulting from government restrictions. Customers who do not use the credit for 12 months will get a refund.
Washington first imposed restrictions on China and expanded them this week to continental Europe, prompting U.S. airlines to cut numerous flights and scramble to shore up capital.
Among cost-cutting measures, U.S. airlines are offering employees voluntary unpaid leaves of absence to match staffing with flights.
The outbreak came as Delta and its pilots' union were in contract negotiations, and the sides reached an agreement on coronavirus-related sick leave and managing overstaffing for April with partially paid schedules. United and Southwest could reach deals with their pilots soon, sources said. 
On Friday, Delta said it would cut capacity 40% in the next few months, the largest reduction in its history. It will eliminate nearly all flights to continental Europe for 30 days and will park up to 300 aircraft.
United also announced cuts to European service this week. On Friday, major U.S. airlines confirmed they had been in talks with the White House and Congress about financial assistance.
The U.S. Chamber of Commerce on Friday called on the government to ""turn next to a package to assist impacted employers... No business should go bankrupt because of a temporary loss in revenue as a result of the coronavirus.""
Airlines are reeling from a plunge in bookings and traffic, as the fast-spreading pandemic prompts travel restrictions and event cancellations around the world.

U.S. passenger railroad Amtrak said on Saturday it was scaling back services due to reduced demand. Last week the company said bookings had plunged 50% since the coronavirus outbreak.

CHICAGO (Reuters) - Southwest Airlines (N:LUV), one of the few U.S. airlines still flying a full schedule even as the spreading coronavirus has sapped demand, said on Saturday it was ""seriously considering"" cutting flights in the short term.
Southwest spokeswoman Michelle Agnew said the company would monitor demand for additional reductions after a first round of cuts, which one source familiar with the matter said could be announced by Wednesday.
Agnew said the company did not have any more details to share at this time.
The low-cost carrier does not fly to any of the destinations that have been affected by health alerts and a growing list of U.S. travel restrictions as coronavirus cases climb worldwide.
However, the airline had already warned that the epidemic could wipe up to $300 million from its first-quarter operating revenue, with Chief Executive Gary Kelly warning earlier this month that reducing prices would not address consumer fear."

1364,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 14, 2020 06:35AM ET</span>","As Wall Street reels, veterans recall '87 while the young look to textbooks","By Noel Randewich and Ross Kerber
(Reuters) - As U.S. financial markets reel from a week of historic swings, industry veterans are drawing on memories from their earliest years on Wall Street, while younger professionals are looking to lessons from history books.
Following an 11-year bull market, many investors have never experienced a market selloff as violent as the near 27% slump in the S&P 500 (SPX) from its record highs through Thursday, brought on by fears about the coronavirus pandemic, or Friday's 9% rebound.
Thursday's 10% drop on the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) was its steepest one-day decline since Oct. 19, 1987, now known as ""Black Monday,"" when the Dow crashed a record 22.6%.
Clayton Phillips, a 25 year-old financial adviser at Keenan Financial in Boston, said the recent selloffs marked the first major declines he has seen during his two-and-half years in the industry. The best precedents, he said, were financial histories he studied in preparation for a certification exam.
""I've been reading about this,"" he said. ""But it's different to see it in real time.""
Villere & Co partner George Young began working as a stock broker in 1984 and remembers offers to buy and sell shares of smaller companies all but drying up on Black Monday.
Young said his biggest takeaway from that day is, ""If you can stand the volatility, you will be rewarded over time. But you have to take a sanguine and long-term attitude.""
Since the S&P 500 began its tumble from its Feb. 19 record high over fears about the coronavirus and its potential damage to the global economy, markets have been besieged by volatility. The S&P 500 has seen 12 days in 2020 with swings of 1% or more, compared to 15 such days in all of 2019.
Friday's comeback, after U.S. President Donald Trump declared a national emergency to combat the outbreak, was the biggest one-day percentage gain for the S&P 500 since Oct. 28, 2008.
Many Millennials in recent years embraced stocks, anxious to partake in a bull market that started in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis and stretched through February. Too young to remember the market traumas of 2008, many use the Robinhood smartphone app offering no-fee trades that can make it attractive for investors with small amounts of money.
Phillip Perry, a 37-year-old financial planner and colleague of Phillips' at Keenan Financial, estimated he has spoken with more than 30 clients this week under 30 years old, all of whom were shocked by the market chaos.
""Everybody's freaking out,"" he said. ""They've literally never seen volatility. The VIX has been has been at historic lows, they pick their Robinhood stocks and feel like really savvy investors because it keeps going up. So their initial question now is, do they get out now, do they stop the bleeding?""
Wall Street's fear gauge, the VIX (VIX) jumped to its highest since the 2008 financial crisis on Friday after logging its biggest-ever one-day surge in history the day before.
Perry said he advises his clients to stay the course, speaking as one of the firms' more experienced hands.
His views echo those of Donald Selkin, whose first job in the financial industry was trading commodities at Merrill Lynch in 1978. Now chief market strategist at Newbridge Securities in New York, Selkin said his most vivid Black Monday memories are of traders paying extremely high prices for derivatives to hedge against even more volatility in the sessions that followed.
That ended up being a bad bet because the market soon stabilized, with Black Monday in retrospect appearing to be one of modern history's best buying opportunities.
""My advice to younger people would be to stick your toe in at these lower prices, selectively, and dollar cost average on the down days,"" Selkin said.
Shawn Cruz, TD Ameritrade's 36-year-old manager of trader strategy, in recent days has drawn on lessons he learned at business school about the causes behind the 2008 crisis, and said he has been applying those lessons to predict the coronavirus' likely impact on the economy.
The suspension of professional sports games, canceled conventions and half-empty restaurants has raised fears - not about whether the longest U.S. economic expansion on record is ending - but about how deep a now presumed recession will be.
""It's like when you're in the military and you go through all this training, but it's not like when there are real bullets flying,"" Cruz said."

The change was disclosed in Berkshire's annual proxy filing, ahead of its scheduled May 2 annual meeting.
Chenault, 68, led New York-based American Express from January 2001 to February 2018, and became one of the most prominent black CEOs in corporate America.

Microsoft announced separately on Friday that Gates stepped down from its board.
In Friday's filing, Berkshire also recommended that shareholders reject a proposal by four New York City public pension plans that lists of outside candidates for board seats include ""qualified female and racially/ethnically diverse candidates.""
Three members of Berkshire's 14-person board are women, and Chenault would become the only black director.
Berkshire said it has for decades ""forcefully"" preferred directors with integrity, business savvy, an owner-responsive mindset and a deep personal interest in the company.
It said Chenault emerged as a ""standout and unanimous choice"" after its governance committee reviewed 23 candidates for board seats last year.
Berkshire said it may choose future board members from that list, noting that four directors, including Buffett, are between 89 and 96 years old.
The proxy filing also detailed compensation for top Berkshire executives in 2019.
Buffett was awarded $374,773, including his usual $100,000 salary plus $274,773 for personal and home security services.
Vice Chairmen Greg Abel, 57, and Ajit Jain, 68, who respectively oversee Berkshire's non-insurance and insurance operations, were each awarded $19 million, up from $18 million in 2018.
Buffett sets compensation for Abel and Jain, who many investors view as top candidates to eventually succeed him as CEO. Berkshire does not grant stock options.
While Berkshire's annual meeting will be held as scheduled, the coronavirus pandemic prompted Buffett on Friday to cancel other shareholder events in Omaha for the May 1-3 weekend.

TOKYO (Reuters) - An independent committee investigating a graft scandal at Kansai Electric Power Co Inc (T:9503) said on Saturday a larger number of company officials had received more payments and gifts than Japan's second-largest utility had disclosed.
In a four-page report that was posted on Kansai Electric's website, the independent committee said that 75 officials working in the firm's nuclear power business had received payments and gifts worth 360 million yen ($3.34 million) from the late deputy major of the town of Takahama.
Shigeki Iwane, who formally resigned on Saturday as the company's president, previously said he and 19 colleagues had received payments and gifts worth 320 million yen from the late deputy mayor. Iwane in October said he would resign on the day the report was delivered.
Kansai Electric officials received the gifts over three decades through the 2010s, the independent commission's report said.
A Kansai Electric spokeswoman declined to comment on the independent commission's findings, but added the company would hold a press conference on Saturday evening.
The company appointed Takashi Morimoto, an executive already on its board, as its new president following Iwane's resignation.
An official for Takahama, a town of about 10,000 people in central Japan, also declined to comment on the report's findings, adding the town's mayor planned to hold a news conference about it."
1368,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 13, 2020 07:52PM ET</span>",3 Things Under the Radar This Week,"By Yasin Ebrahim and Kim Khan
Investing.com - Investors would be forgiven for feeling seasick after all sharp moves in the markets this week.
And amid all the historic stock moves, huge sums of Fed money and whipsawing rates there was plenty out of the spotlight.
That includes a broader look at the economy, rather than the daily market gyrations, a Fed program that didn’t get the big headlines and the question of whether we may actually need new words to figure out how to address the problems of the virus.
Here are three things that might have flown under the radar this week.
1. It’s Not Just the Market, It’s the Economy
U.S. stocks staged an epic rebound on Friday, a day after plunging to their worst defeat since the 1987 market crash. But while such wild swings are expected to be commonplace in markets over the next few months, the global economy is set for a gloomier backdrop, analysts warned.
""The worst for the economy is still to come over the next several months,"" said Joachim Fels, global chief economic adviser at Pacific Investment Management Co. (Pimco).
The stark warning comes as a slowdown in both demand and supply in China - amid Beijing's aggressive efforts to contain the virus - is expected to spill over into the world economy.
Fels' warning may even seem tame compared to those of his peers, some of whom are not only sounding the alarm on a coming recession but are urging investors to get out of risk assets.
""The sky is falling,"" said Chris Rupkey of MUFG Union Bank in a note last week. ""Get out, get out while you can. Wall Street’s woes have to eventually hit Main Street’s economy hard. Bet on it.""
Much of the forecasting power on the economic impact from the coronavirus centers on assumptions over when peak infections will likely occur, particularly in countries outside of China.
But with cases showing no sign of a slowdown, particularly in Europe, which has become the epicenter of the outbreak, fears are running higher the pandemic could last a long time.
Against the growing economic threat of the virus, however, global central banks, including the Federal Reserve have pumped liquidity in the market to cushion the blow. But while many argue that demand-boosting stimulus measures are of little use in the fight against the Covid-19, knowing that central banks stand ready to act can be a comfort.
""With rates already at historically low levels, a further reduction is unlikely to provide a meaningful boost to investment or consumption,"" Stifel said in a note. ""But the willingness and ample readiness of central bank officials to deploy policy should reassure investors and help quell knee-jerk reactions to the latest coronavirus tally.""
2. QE4 Is Here
When it came to the Federal Reserve this week, the $1.5 trillion in repo funding stole the headlines, both for its size and its failure to arrest a huge stock selloff (if indeed that was an aim).
Then attention turned to next week’s FOMC meeting, with Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) predicting a rate cut of 100 basis points, up from its previous estimate of 50 bps.
But what may be the biggest weapon in the Fed’s arsenal was slightly overlooked: the return of quantitative easing.
The Fed started Friday with plans to buy around $37 billion in five maturity sectors, with $17 billion in purchases of maturities of seven years or more to address “highly unusual disruptions in the market for Treasury securities associated with the coronavirus outbreak.”
If rates go to zero next week, as expected, then QE is the only avenue to monetary policy accommodation, economists at Pantheon Macroeconomics said.
“(W)e expect the Fed to purchase $60 (billion) of securities across the spectrum for the foreseeable future: QE4 is here,” Pantheon wrote in a note.
“This broader action will offset the inevitable downward pressure on money supply growth as economic activity contracts,” it added. “It should weaken the dollar and raise asset prices, other things equal. They won’t be, but these actions should limit the damage.”
The Fed did not promise that the Treasury purchases will continue beyond April 13, but “it’s inconceivable to us that the Fed will not extend these operations,” Pantheon said.
3. What’s Another Word for ‘Stimulus’?
Along with monetary policy measures, the market is looking for fiscal measures to ease the economic shocks of Covid-19. But in discussing the best tactics, what if we’re not even using the right terminology?
That debate arose on Twitter, centering on whether it’s useful to use a generally accepted term like “fiscal stimulus” in exceptional economic times.
We’re currently in a situation where a “stimulus is anything that slows the spread of the virus, even if in the immediate sense it ‘hurts’ the economy,” Austan Goolsbee, former chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, argued.
Bloomberg’s Joe Weisenthal replied that “stimulus” is the wrong idea, as that boosts the economy, and what’s needed is something that keeps households supplied with cash to meet their financial obligations.
We’re “trapped with the semantics of a (pre-Covid-19) world,” said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton. “We need to hit the reset button on thinking and verbiage, while not losing sight of the meaning. This doesn’t have to be the Titantic. We need lifeboats in all ways we can think of to fight the chill.”

1369,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 13, 2020 07:47PM ET</span>","Americans rush to stock up on essentials, retailers scramble to keep up","By Barbara Goldberg and Laila Kearney
NEW YORK (Reuters) - From Jersey City on the East Coast to Los Angeles on the West Coast, American shoppers picked grocery store shelves clean on products ranging from disinfectants to rice, causing retailers to race to restock their stores as the worsening coronavirus crisis stoked fears of shortages.
As shoppers swarmed stores, President Donald Trump on Friday afternoon declared a national emergency aimed at slowing the spread of the novel virus, which has killed at least 47 people in the United States. 
Daily routines have been upended as businesses including Amazon.com (O:AMZN) urge employees to work from home, schools and universities close, and sporting events and church services are paused across the country. In response to the run on certain items, major retailers have imposed some purchase limits.
The chief executive of Walmart Inc (N:WMT), Doug McMillon, at a news conference with Trump on Friday, said the retailer was having trouble keeping up with demand for products like hand sanitizer Purell, cleaning supplies and paper goods.
""Hand sanitizer is going to be very difficult to have 100% in stock for some time,"" McMillon said. ""We're still replenishing it ... but as soon as it hits the stores it's going. The same thing is true for the other categories I mentioned."" 
In Hanover, New Jersey, about 40 customers had lined up to get into a Wegmans grocery store before it opened on Friday morning. A few hours later, shelves were stripped bare of sanitizing wipes, bulk rice and dried beans. The store posted signs announcing limits on the purchase of hand sanitizer and bottled water.
""An abundance of caution - semper paratus, like the Coast Guard motto that means 'always ready,'"" shopper Marlene Russell, 69, told a reporter after packing groceries into her car. 
At a Fairway Market on Manhattan's Upper West Side, shelves normally full of pasta, Oreo cookies, pasta sauce, crackers and toilet paper were depleted on Thursday evening. On the West Coast, grocery stores including Ralphs, Pavilions and Trader Joe's had sold out of products ranging from eggs to Lysol cleaning wipes. 
RETAILERS REACT
Johnson & Johnson (N:JNJ) is accelerating production of over-the-counter pain killer Tylenol to ease any spot inventory crunches.
J&J, which also makes Listerine mouthwash, said it was shipping stocks of products in a controlled manner. It was increasing production of other consumer products to ensure retailers were well supplied, it said, adding it did not expect any shortages.
Pharmacy chain Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc (O:WBA) and supermarket chain  Kroger Co  (N:KR) instituted purchase limits to stabilize inventory.
Kroger, the largest U.S. grocery store operator, limited the number of cold, flu and sanitary products per visit, while Walgreens said it was limiting disinfectant wipes and cleaners, face masks, hand sanitizers, thermometers and gloves to four per customer.
John Terry, 33, went to a Whole Foods in Manhattan to pick up chicken and other items his wife was unable to get at grocery stores near their Jersey City home, in New Jersey across the Hudson River from Manhattan.
""It was insanity,"" he said about his local stores. ""She went to Costco (NASDAQ:COST) and there was a line down the block. At another one, the shelves were picked clean."" 
Phil Lempert, editor of SupermarketGuru, said labor shortages due to everything from school closures to illness could cause business disruptions that last several months. 

""It's a lot more than stockpiling toilet paper or Purell. This is going to have implications on our food supply and supply chain for months to come,"" Lempert said.

1370,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 13, 2020 07:33PM ET</span>",Drumbeat of bad coronavirus news starts to hit U.S. auto dealers,"By Ben Klayman
DETROIT (Reuters) - A relentless barrage of bad news surrounding the coronavirus epidemic has begun to affect customer visits at some U.S. auto dealers and even those businesses that have thrived so far believe a big sales decline is imminent if China's experience is any guide.
Since the coronavirus outbreak began in China last year it has killed more than 5,000 people globally, including 41 so far in the United States, where President Donald Trump on Friday declared a national emergency.
The outbreak has caused automakers to shutter plants in Asia and Europe, and the mounting responses in the United States - school closures, pro sports leagues suspending play and other big events canceled - are now being felt by some U.S. dealers. For a sign of what may be in store, analysts said look no further than China, where auto sales plunged 79% last month.
""Sales are definitely falling,"" said John Luciano, managing partner with Street Volkswagen in Amarillo, Texas, and chairman of Volkswagen's (DE:VOWG_p) national dealer council. ""We're waking up in a different world a little bit more every day.""
At Russ Shelton's Buick GMC dealership in Rochester Hills, Michigan, so far this month customer visits are down 30% while the service department has seen a 40% drop in business due to the outbreak. 
""When schools close, mothers get worried - and this stops economic activity,"" industry consultant and former GM executive Warren Browne said.
Cox Automotive now sees negative U.S. economic growth in the second quarter and has withdrawn its forecast for 16.6 million new-vehicle sales in the United States this year. 
Even businesses whose sales have remained strong acknowledge this week could mark the beginning of a big decline.
""It's going to happen,"" Beau Boeckmann, president of Galpin Ford in the Los Angeles area and one of the largest U.S. Ford dealers, said of a potential drop in sales. ""We're kind of still in this odd wait-and-see moment.""
 Ford Motor Co  (N:F) Chief Operating Officer Jim Farley and other executives outlined on a Friday call with dealers how the outbreak has not interrupted U.S. vehicle production and sales through last weekend finished ahead of company projections, according to dealers on the call. 
However, Ford spokesman Mark Truby acknowledged some dealers have seen customer traffic decline.
General Motors (N:GM) spokesman Jim Cain said the U.S. automaker's sales have been strong in most markets, but the company understands that could change.
""We'll have to see how long this crisis lasts,"" he said. ""It stands to reason that sales would fall in some markets as people are putting basic needs first.""
J.P. Miller, owner of a Ford dealer in Lexington, Kentucky, where the University of Kentucky at this time of year would normally be competing for the NCAA men's basketball championship, shifted advertising he had planned around that event to alerting consumers to online car-buying options.

 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analyst Adam Jonas said one possible fiscal stimulus for the industry the Trump administration could consider would be a form of ""Cash for Clunkers,"" a $3 billion federal program in 2009 that incentivized consumers to swap aging gas-guzzlers for new, more fuel-efficient vehicle.

1371,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 13, 2020 06:55PM ET</span>",How the longest bull run in history ended in pandemic panic,"By Tom Westbrook and Scott Murdoch
SINGAPORE/HONG KONG (Reuters) - As a collapse in the oil price unleashed chaos in financial markets, Madrid money manager Diego Parrilla phoned a colleague who agreed: they had better head to work early in the morning.
By daybreak in Europe, the price of crude oil had fallen by a third. The shock had turned worry about the coronavirus to full-blown panic, wiped trillions of dollars from Asian stocks and sent futures for European and U.S. markets plunging.
""We assessed the book,"" said Parrilla, 46, who runs a 300 million euro ($332 million) fund that is long gold and bonds and uses options to bet on just about everything but dollars and volatility falling.
""We were in a good position,"" he said. ""We decided which parts of the portfolio we would take profits on first.""
So began what became the worst week on Wall Street since 2008, which has left Parrilla one of the few winners in the shakeout that ended the longest bull run in U.S. history. His Quadriga Igneo fund is up 30% for the year to date.
The wipeout has also exposed the complacency of investors as markets marched toward record peaks in February, and the inadequacy of their protection as traditional risk correlations broke down in the rout.
And for others it holds both clues as to what happens next and great promise.
""It's these times that great fortunes are built, not bull markets,"" said James Rosenberg, private client advisor at brokerage and wealth manager Baillieu Holst in Sydney.
""But you have to buy the right companies, you have to have an appetite for some pain and misery and you have to be patient.""
OIL SHOCK
The twist that sent markets already stressed by the global coronavirus outbreak into a tailspin was a plunge in the already weak oil price that followed Saudi Arabia's move to launch a price war with Russia last weekend.
The 30% drop had oil-linked currencies cratering – the rouble fell 9% - and the stock prices of household-name oil majors from Shell (AS:RDSa) to ExxonMobil (N:XOM) were down by double digits.
By day's end, the bonds of heavily indebted energy firms were trading many times beneath their face value, and fears of a credit crunch were growing.
It was at this point that Parrilla, who had argued for years that equities were overvalued and that the cost of betting against them in the options market was good value, was laying fresh bets.
""We came in on Monday, and we see things are happening. And from a disciplined point of view, we were actually putting more trades, on things that were lagging, such as the VIX,"" he said, referring to the Chicago Board Options Exchange's Volatility Index.
Talk on trading floors and at funds from Sydney to Singapore, Hong Kong, London and New York, was of crisis.
""When these big things happen, then you have no floor,"" said Sean Taylor, chief investment officer for Asia-Pacific at German asset management firm DWS. ""You can't really work out the fundamentals, it's not priced in,"" he said.
Taylor spent the evening on a phone hook-up with other regional chiefs to discuss the oil move, followed by another meeting the next evening to go over global economic forecasts.
""When it happens, you can't do much about it,"" said Taylor, whose experience in the Mexican, Russian and Asian financial crises in the 1990s and the global financial crisis in 2008, taught him hard lessons about liquidity and helped him prepare.
""People laugh at the old-fashioned techniques of the older guys, but when it happens we come out slightly better, because you're not caught with midcaps and liquidity. It's liquidity that really gets you in these markets,"" he said.
WRONG-WAY WEDNESDAY
Which is more or less what played out through the rest of the week, after what proved to be a dead-cat bounce on Tuesday.
U.S. President Donald Trump's announcement on Wednesday of surprise restrictions on travel from 26 European nations, his failure to mention medical measures that would be taken to combat coronavirus and disappointment over the European Central Bank's decision not to cut interest rates didn't just put stock indexes into freefall.
Rather than fleeing into safe havens, investors sold them to cover other losses. Bond yields, which had dived only days earlier, rose. At the same time volatility in the currency market shot higher with the squeeze in liquidity.
""The amounts are smaller, but the spreads are much wider because liquidity is starting to disappear from the system,"" said Stuart Oakley, Nomura's global head of flow FX in Singapore.
""The markets have become so disorderly the correlations between assets and currencies have completely broken down. We're in an entirely different world. It's unnerving bigtime, because it tells you people are being forced to unwind positions.""
BLACK THURSDAY
By Thursday it had become a mad scramble for dollars and nothing else, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) suffering its worst day since 1987. After a big rebound on Friday, the index was down 10.4% for the week while the S&P 500 index (SPX) had shed 8.9%.
When Australian fund manager Geoff Wilson woke at 2 a.m., as is his custom, the tone of voice alone on CNBC was enough to know the crash he had begun to prepare for was on.
""This has happened so quickly,"" said Wilson, whose firm Wilson Asset Management runs roughly A$3 billion ($1.84 billion) and has more than doubled its cash exposure over the past three weeks.
""To me this is a combination of '87 and the global financial crisis,"" he said, having spent the week between work and home revisiting every investment thesis to weed out weak stocks.
""We'd bought them because when interest rates are low and the economy's going reasonably well, then debt wasn't a major concern ... now that's out the door.""
By the end of the week Europe's benchmark STOXX 600 index (STOXX) had fallen 18%. Australia's ASX 200 index (AXJO) was down 11% and the S&P 500 was headed for its worst week since 2008.
Like Parrilla in Madrid, who has another leg of bets on a further downturn in China, Wilson expects things to get worse before they get better.
Others, though, are finding some of the discounts irresistible.
Scott Flanders, former chief executive officer of Playboy Enterprises and the head of online insurance marketplace eHealth, called his brokers in New York at breakfast time in Palo Alto, California, on Monday.
""I'm putting money to work right now,"" he said.
""I bought 5,000 shares in JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), I bought Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) and  Citigroup  (NYSE:C). They're getting hit hard ... but they're so much better capitalized than they were during the '08 crisis.""

1373,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 13, 2020 06:11PM ET</span>",Some short-seller bets looked surprising in coronavirus crash,"(Reuters) - Some short-seller favorites this week as the U.S. stock market nosedived on coronavirus fears looked counter-intuitive because the companies might benefit from the crisis, notably 3M Co (N:MMM),  Facebook Inc  (O:FB) and Alphabet Inc (O:GOOGL), according to S3 Partners.
Short sellers sell borrowed shares in the hope of buying them back at a cheaper price and pocketing the difference.
Short sellers built their largest dollar bets in biopharmaceutical company Abbvie (N:ABBV) this week to Thursday, according to S3, but even more notable was the popularity of 3M, which makes everything from Post-it notes to protective masks.
Although mask demand surged as people looked frantically for protection against infection from the coronavirus, 3M saw the eighth biggest increase in the dollar amount of its shares sold short this week, with an additional $245.75 million more of its shares borrowed to sell, the firm's data showed.
Facebook was also in high demand with shorts with an additional $244.9 million of its shares sold short in the same timeframe, making it the ninth most popular among shorts. The two classes of shares in Google parent Alphabet were also in demand, making them the 11th and 18th most popular stocks to borrow. In Alphabet's C shares, $234.3 million worth were sold short, while $184.1 million of its A shares were borrowed to sell.
""Those are things I wouldn't have thought would be on this list because their products and services are high demand,"" said S3 managing director Ihor Dusaniwsky, noting that as more people stayed home with a view to protecting against the virus' spread, it would seem likely that they would use online services such as Facebook and Google more than ever.
By Friday's close 3M shares were 10.9% below where they were before the broader market sell-off began on Feb. 20. In comparison the S&P 500 (SPX) benchmark index on Friday was 19.9% below its Feb. 19 record. Facebook fell 21.7% in the same timeframe, and Alphabet's A shares have fallen more than 20%.
Abbvie saw an increase in short selling to the tune of $402.7 million worth of shares, according to S3.
At No. 2 was MGM Resorts (N:MGM) with $342.4 million worth of new short-selling, followed by  Exxon Mobil  Corp (N:XOM).
The stocks with the biggest decline in the value of short positions in the last week were Digital Realty (N:DLR), AT&T Inc (N:T) and  Lockheed Martin  Corp (N:LMT).
According to data from IHS Markit, the most shorted U.S. stocks were the biggest decliners so far this month.
Out of a group of 3,000 U.S. equities, the average stock fell 24.9% from the start of March to the close of trading on Thursday, but the stocks with most shares shorted fell 28.4% in the same timeframe, according to Samuel Pierson, director of securities finance at IHS Markit."
1374,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 13, 2020 06:09PM ET</span>","Citigroup, JPMorgan report New York cases of coronavirus","By Imani Moise
(Reuters) - New York-based banks  Citigroup  Inc (N:C) and JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) both reported on Friday that they have employees who have tested positive for the coronavirus. 
Citi said that one employee was confirmed to have the virus, and JPMorgan confirmed that two of its employees do.
The announcements followed similar news from banks such as  Wells Fargo  & Co (N:WFC),  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS) and others, as the flu-like virus continues to spread in the United States and worldwide.
JPMorgan spokesman Brian Marchiony said two employees at the bank's midtown Manhattan headquarters have the virus and have been at home receiving treatment since earlier this week. 
""They are both doing well at this time,"" Marchiony said by email. The bank has asked employees who came into close contact with the individuals to work from home for two weeks. 
Citi said its employee who has tested positive for the virus was last in the office on March 6 and was diagnosed Friday while on personal travel to Singapore. The Citi employee did not exhibit any symptoms while he was in the office and did not visit any Citi facilities while traveling, the bank said. 
Citi has given employees who worked on the same floor as that colleague the option to work from home.
Both banks have already taken measures to limit the spread of the virus, including splitting its North American workforce, imposing business travel restrictions, limiting large meetings and, at Citi, putting up reminders to practice social distancing. 

Both banks said they are rigorously cleaning all office spaces regularly. JPMorgan Chase said it is deep cleaning both employees' work spaces in addition to the normal cleaning measures.

1375,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 13, 2020 06:04PM ET</span>",Boeing supplier woes increase as coronavirus grounds more jets,"By Tracy Rucinski and Eric M. Johnson
CHICAGO/SEATTLE (Reuters) - Boeing Co's (N:BA) suppliers, already reeling from a 737 MAX grounding one year ago on Friday, face an even slimmer workload as flight cancellations spurred by the spreading coronavirus mean less airline demand for spare parts and services.
Equipment suppliers like United Technologies (N:UTX), Honeywell (N:HON) and  Safran  (PA:SAF) make a large portion of their profits in the aircraft business on the aftermarket for spares and maintenance.
But with demand slumping, airlines are canceling flights, idling jets and trying to negotiate shorter-term maintenance programs in an effort to preserve their own cash.
""Our business model involves long cycles,"" said Philippe Petitcolin, chief executive of France's Safran (PA:SAF), the world's second-largest supplier of aircraft equipment and third-largest aerospace contractor overall.
""We don't earn money on the first installation on a new plane but on the life of our products over 20 years. If planes don't fly, we don't sell spare parts and our products don't create a need for maintenance,"" he told French reporters.
Safran co-produces engines for the 737 MAX alongside  General Electric  (N:GE).
Many parts have to be repaired or replaced at set intervals, driven by the number of flights since the last regular check.
Suppliers that have already slowed a significant slice of their manufacturing because of a Boeing 737 MAX production freeze that began in January are especially exposed.
""When it starts going down, it's usually faster than you think,"" said Eric Bernardini, co-head of aerospace, defense and aviation at consultants AlixPartners.
Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) said in a research note on Friday it estimates that 175 MAX aircraft will likely be cancelled between now and its estimated return to service in October. Boeing shares closed up 10% on Friday.
So far this year the Chicago firm is advising more aerospace companies on cash management than in all of 2019, he said.
Financial distress rippling through the airline industry on Friday, as the epidemic hits demand and prompts travel restrictions, is more bad news for suppliers.
The link between aftermarkets and airline profits emerged in the 2009 financial crisis when airlines carried out maintenance hand-to-mouth, replacing just the parts needed to keep planes safely and legally flying for another 6-12 months rather than the six years guaranteed by a full overhaul, Petitcolin said.
A Boeing spokesman said it is in frequent contact with suppliers to deal with disruption through contingency plans.
SILVER LINING
United Technologies unit Collins Aerospace, which makes avionics, seating and lighting, has already warned adjusted operating profit would be hit by $550 million to $600 million this year, largely due to the MAX.
If the coronavirus crisis persists for another three months, companies will have to reassess.
""The uncertainty is so high, you can't just say I have a plan and I'm good for the next six months, you have to revisit this on a weekly and monthly basis. From what you had forecast, is it getting worse or is it getting better?"" Bernardini said.
The crisis is not without a silver lining.
Suppliers have been grappling with efforts by Boeing and Airbus (PA:AIR) to compete with them directly in the aftermarket.
Traditionally jetmakers left the high-margin servicing business to parts suppliers and in return got attractive prices on development and parts supplied with aircraft when brand-new.
The drive by manufacturers to shift the business model was due to receive a decisive test with the arrival of a mid-sized aircraft being pondered by Boeing, with suppliers under pressure to grant Boeing a bigger share of the post-sales market.
Boeing placed the project on ice in January due to the MAX crisis and analysts say coronavirus turmoil is likely to delay it further, though the tug of war between planemakers and their suppliers over aftermarket profits has merely been postponed.
""Manufacturers want cheap parts up-front and now they want aftermarket business. They can't have both,"" one supplier said."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - George Curtis is facing a severe financial crisis. 
He has to be out of his Swarthmore College dorm room by Sunday. He lost his campus job and cannot travel home to Montana from the Philadelphia-area liberal arts college because he is not feeling well. 
Nor does he want to endanger the health of his 71-year-old father. 
There were about 20 million students attending U.S. colleges and universities as of last fall, according to the National Center for Education Statistics. Now, like Curtis, a 20-year-old Classics junior, many of them are in limbo because of coronavirus closures on campuses. 
Swarthmore, like most every major institution of higher education, is moving to remote learning in the coming days and sending students packing, except a few who receive exemptions to stay on campus. 
The competition for those spots is tough, and Curtis was denied. 
College communities are responding in a variety of ways, some offering pro-rated refunds for room and board, covering travel for those on financial aid and offering stipends for moving and packing expenses. U-Haul is also offering free storage for students across the country. (https:// Harvard's Primus organization, for first-generation low-income students, reached out immediately to the school's vast alumni network with a set of Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) spreadsheets to find out who could take in students, store boxes and offer jobs.  At Berea College in Kentucky, a free-tuition institution that serves a low-income population, President Lyle Roelofs said he expects to house more than 200 students out of 1,660 because they have nowhere else to go. Remote instruction is being tailored to a population that does not have reliable internet at home, and deadlines to drop classes have been extended.  There are also crowd-sourcing appeals coming from all over to help American students. As these are not vetted or registered charities, potential donors should do their own research before sending funds.  To help students beyond just one's own school affiliation, there are national efforts that are official charities, like the Student Relief Fund (studentrelieffund.org).  For Sara Goldrick-Rab, the founding director of the Hope Center for College, Community and Justice and a professor at Temple University in Philadelphia, the current situation highlights an ongoing crisis of income instability for many college students. She has a running hashtag on social media (#RealCollege) to help raise awareness. One plea Goldrick-Rab received was from a young woman who is being raised by her sister, who is also in college. With her school closing, she needed to get from Florida to Ohio, but she had no funds, so she was going to try to hitchhike.  ""People think that these students will go home and party and chill and mom and dad will take care of them. Some of them will. Good for them. But a lot of them aren't in that situation,"" Goldrick-Rab said. CONTINUING ED Sustained online learning presents a few particular financial issues for students:  * Students using military stipends via the GI Bill may face a lower housing payout ""for any subsequent terms pursued solely online,"" according to Christina Mandreucci, press secretary for the Department of Veterans Affairs. If the program is not approved by the relevant authority, all funding could stop, she noted. * Students who chose to discontinue or pause their studies rather than continue with online learning may go into repayment status on their student loans, or use up their six-month grace period.  ""The best advice is to make a phone call to the loan servicer and see what applies to your situation,"" said Sabrina Manville, co-founder of Edmit.me, a college financial information site.  * Students already in repayment status who are facing income disruptions should also heed the advice to call their loan servicer and check into their options, Manville said. Those who think this might be a long-term issue can look into income-driven repayment plans, and for just short-term issues there are forbearance options that can pause your payment. Deferment is a middle option, Manville said, because interest still accrues on the loan balance.  President Donald Trump announced on Friday that student loan interest would be waived until further notice. * Students who are no longer on campus also no longer have income from their student jobs. This is still a developing situation, so most schools have not announced how they will help. At Berea College, though, Roelofs said students would continue to be paid.  For now, Curtis is planning to couch-surf somewhere in the Northeast and get by as best he can. He and his friends still on campus are using up as many of their meal credits as possible.  ""It’s like Belshazzar’s Feast,” Curtis said, referring to the biblical story and the Rembrandt painting depicting it.

1378,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 13, 2020 05:42PM ET</span>",Wall Street weekahead: Investors hope Fed can help calm markets as big rate cut expected,"By Lewis Krauskopf
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Interest rate cuts won't cure the coronavirus but investors are still hoping the Federal Reserve can take some actions to help soothe the roiled stock market.
Only days after a rare emergency rate cut, the Fed is expected at its regularly scheduled meeting next Wednesday to slash its target rate another 75 to 100 basis points to near zero, according to the CME FedWatch website.
The U.S. central bank also may announce measures to ensure sufficient liquidity and lending or to purchase assets by restarting the quantitative easing that the Fed employed during the financial crisis.
A move like that could offer some comfort to investors after Thursday's bruising decline, in which the Dow Jones Industrial Average notched its biggest one-day drop since 1987.
""If the market feels the Fed is responding appropriately and is helping investors and consumers, and feel like somebody is in charge, maybe that can help settle things down,” said Willie Delwiche, investment strategist at Baird in Milwaukee.
Indeed, stocks briefly pared losses on Thursday after the New York Fed said on it will introduce $1.5 trillion in new repo operations this week and start purchasing a range of maturities as part of its monthly Treasury purchases. But the rebound was short lived and the S&P 500 ended down 9.5% on the day.
Expectations for a more significant rate cut have increased this week as the market decline deepened over fears about the economic fallout of the coronavirus crisis. As of Thursday, the S&P 500 had fallen more than 26% from its Feb. 19 record closing high, including a drop of more than 16% so far for the week.
Traders currently expect the Fed to cut its target rate from its current range of 1-1.25% to as low as 0-0.25%. Some market watchers wonder if the central bank could even eventually go into negative territory.
""Central banks must bolster confidence that they are willing to test the limits of where they view the effective bound on rates,"" JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) economists said in a note this week.
Markets will respond ""poorly"" should the Fed fail to cut rates, said Nela Richardson, investment strategist at Edward Jones, but added that ""the risk of aggressive action now is that you sacrifice valuable ammunition in the short term to boost short-term market sentiment.""
""You might need the ammunition further down the road if unemployment increases or deflation starts,"" Richardson said.
Of course, rate cuts may not help equities. The S&P 500 ended up falling 2.8% on March 3 despite the Fed's surprise half-percentage point cut, which boosted sentiment but also led investors to speculate on what other actions the Fed could take.
Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren said last week that the central bank needed ""to think broadly about what tools we would use"" if the virus continues to weigh, and that it ""could be important"" to let the Fed buy assets other than U.S. Treasury and mortgage-backed securities.
Such asset purchases aimed at stimulating the economy, known as quantitative easing (QE), were a key tool used by the Fed to emerge from the 2007-2009 financial crisis.
""Should the Fed gauge that reducing rates is not providing for easier financial conditions, we expect it to quickly turn to quantitative easing,""  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) economists said in a note.
Whatever actions the Fed takes, some investors said they are ultimately secondary to the responses of the world's governments.
In the United States, partisan gridlock threatens to derail the government's ability to contain the economic damage. Democrats in the House of Representatives have unveiled a plan that would expand programs including food assistance and unemployment aid. The Republican-led Senate will delay its recess to work next week on its own legislation.
""While we think central bank policy is important, we think the fiscal is much more important at this stage,"" said Eric Freedman, chief investment officer at U.S. Bank Wealth Management."

State and local government debt is headed toward a 4.2% loss, the biggest weekly drop since at least May 1987, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That wiped $66 billion from the Bloomberg  Barclays  (LON:BARC) municipal-bond index’s market capitalization.
It’s unclear whether more pain is ahead as the coronavirus threatens to shut down broad swaths of the economy and causes fearful Americans to pull out their cash. The market showed signs of stabilizing on Friday, much to the relief of investors who saw 30-year benchmark yields jump about half a percentage point on Thursday alone, a record. Yields were mostly unchanged on Friday afternoon.
UBS Financial Services strategists said in a note on Thursday that they expect more volatility until there are signs of containment of the virus. They said investors are likely to keep pulling their money from mutual funds, which could slow down a rebound in prices.
People in the industry can commiserate with others, like stock traders, who had a bad week, too. In 1987, municipals at first felt the hit alone. That May, the state and local securities market fell 5% in a week. Later that year, the stock market crashed in a rout known as Black Monday, which wasn’t rivaled until this week."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - As Americans hole up at home to wait out the coronavirus pandemic, fewer people are going out to eat, leading some fast food chains to cut delivery fees and meal delivery platforms to suspend commissions.
Third-party delivery provider  Grubhub Inc  (N:GRUB) said on Thursday that it will suspend the collection of commission fees it normally charges to restaurants nationwide to be on its app, up to $100 million.
Restaurants need the financial relief. They face an expected drop in diners as states and cities postpone major events – from the Boston Marathon to Broadway shows - and crack down on dining establishments and other gathering places themselves.
In New York state, restaurants must cut their seating capacity in half by 5 p.m. on Friday or else possibly be forced to close.
Some chains are offering free delivery as a way to help offset in-store declines.
Fast-casual restaurant  Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc  (N:CMG) will provide free delivery from Sunday through the end of March on orders over $10 placed through its app.
Fried chicken chain KFC, owned by Yum! Brands (N:YUM), will offer free delivery in the United States starting on Saturday through April 26. A service fee will still apply, as will a small order fee for deliveries under $12.
Grubhub is KFC's exclusive national delivery partner, after Yum bought a 3% stake in the company for $200 million in 2018.
Third-party delivery platforms were already under pressure from some smaller restaurants - and from lawmakers - to cap fees and be more transparent.
Some restaurants pay commission rates of 25% or more in exchange for prime placement in search results and other marketing and services.
Late last month, the New York City Council introduced legislation to limit commission fees to third-party platforms at 10% and require the platforms to obtain operating licenses.
New York City Councilman Mark Gjonaj, who chairs the council's small business committee, applauded Grubhub's suspension of restaurant fees and said he was in talks with other platforms including DoorDash Inc, Postmates and Uber Technologies Inc's (N:UBER) Uber Eats to ask them also to reduce their fees.
Not everyone thought the move went far enough. The NYC Hospitality Alliance said Grubhub's announcement created confusion because it lacked details on who was a ""qualified independent restaurant"" and would be able to delay commission payments.
Instead, the alliance said, Grubhub should permanently lower its fees as they try to survive the coronavirus crisis."

Several days of turmoil on financial markets have pushed the White House to expand its response to the virus, which threatens to bring the U.S. and world economies to a halt. Trump also announced plans Friday to expand access to medical treatment and buy oil for strategic reserves.
American students owe $1.6 trillion in student debt. The Treasury owns about three-quarters of those loans, and is the guarantor for most of the rest.
In 2018, the government collected roughly $20 billion in interest charges as part of some $80 billion it received in overall repayments, according to a Moody’s report last year."
1384,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 13, 2020 05:02PM ET</span>",Borders Tighten Within EU as Germany Readies Virus Aid Package,"(Bloomberg) --
Denmark, Poland and Cyprus tightened their borders to limit the spread of the coronavirus even as European leaders called for more concerted action to contain the economic fallout.
Germany, which borders both countries, pledged to spend whatever was necessary to protect its economy and the European Commission said it’s ready to green-light widespread spending after a market meltdown and a forecast that the euro zone was headed for recession.
With Group of Seven policy makers struggling to forge a united front, the response from national capitals reflects the urgency to avoid the lockdown that hit Italy amid an epidemic that seemed to be spiraling out of control. In Denmark, only Danes, Danish residents and green card holders will be let in. For everyone else, the country’s borders will be closed until April 14 and people arriving in Denmark will be sent back.
“We’re painfully aware that this will have severe consequences,” Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said in Copenhagen on Friday, as she announced borders would close. “We can see how the situation in Italy developed in a catastrophic direction,” she said. “Everything we’re doing is to ensure that we get through this situation in a different way.”
Likewise, Cyprus is closing its borders for 15 days to foreigners who don’t live or work on the Mediterranean island, President Nicos Anastasiades said in a televised address.
Poland implemented full checks at its border crossings for at least the next 10 days, with Premier Mateusz Morawiecki saying the government would quarantine Polish nationals as well as foreigners crossing into the country, while allowing trade to continue. “We want to reduce risks as much as it’s possible to do,” he said.
Success Story
Meantime, French President Emmanuel Macron proposed that EU leaders discuss coordinated action to add stricter border controls.
The ability to travel without border checks has been a fact of life for more than two decades in most of Europe, with passport-free movement arguably the most successful feature of daily life for more than 400 million people in the EU. Officials in Brussels are accepting the new -- if temporary -- restrictions through gritted teeth.
“General travel bans are not seen as being the most effective by the World Health Organization,” said Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, the bloc’s executive arm. “Moreover, they have a strong social and economic impact. They disrupt people’s lives and business across the borders.”
Just hours earlier, German officials announced KfW, the state bank, can lend as much as 550 billion euros ($610 billion) to companies to ensure they survive the pandemic and shield their workers from its impact. Switzerland pledged 10 billion francs ($10.5 billion) of aid for its companies. European stocks surged.
“This is the bazooka,” Finance Minister Olaf Scholz. “We’re using it to do what is necessary. We’ll check later to see if we need additional smaller weapons.”
Chancellor Angela Merkel said later on Friday that the measures show “that we’re ready to do whatever is necessary, to do whatever Germany needs, so we can get through this crisis as best possible.”
Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez declared a state of emergency Friday after the number of confirmed cases jumped by 40% in 24 hours to 4,209. A week ago there were 261. “The Spanish government will do whatever it takes” to slow contagion, Sanchez said.
Switzerland’s aid program is targeted at small businesses and freelancers who’ve been hit by government restrictions on cultural events and school closures. “To them we say, we’re not abandoning you,” President Simonetta Sommaruga told reporters in Bern.
European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde triggered a massive selloff on Thursday when she indicated the ECB wasn’t prepared to bail out the markets. On Friday, her ECB colleagues insisted the central bank still has plenty of ammunition and is willing to use it.
Italian Governing Council member Ignazio Visco told Bloomberg Television that officials are prepared to target bond purchases toward the worst-hit countries -- such as his -- to narrow bond spreads. That would make borrowing more affordable for companies, individuals and the government in Italy as they ride out the downturn.
“We can frontload, we can concentrate on particular jurisdictions according to the circumstances,” Visco said in the interview.
Trading was volatile throughout the day, with the Stoxx 600 Index rising 1.4% after having jumped almost 9%. The weekly loss was 18%.
Completing the barrage of policy pledges, European Commission President Von der Leyen said she’s ready to recommend that euro members trigger an emergency clause in their budget rules that would allow the whole bloc to engage in fiscal stimulus if there’s a severe downturn.
In the meantime, she said countries can have full flexibility within the fiscal rules, meaning measures to address the impact of the virus won’t be factored into the assessment of their deficits. Italy has already announced a 25 billion euro stimulus package that is set to push its deficit beyond the 3% limit this year.
The commission also announced a 37 billion-euro “Corona Investment Fund” that would use spare money from the EU budget to help businesses, healthcare systems and sectors in need. It also said the EU’s own investment fund will guarantee 8 billion euros of loans to 100,000 small- and medium-sized enterprises. Affected companies will be able to delay the payment of their existing loans."

1387,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 13, 2020 04:22PM ET</span>","Exclusive: U.S. Fed, banks discuss possible leniency on liquidity threshold to aid lending - sources","By Pete Schroeder and Michelle Price
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Reserve is talking with lenders about potentially going easy on them if they deplete their liquidity reserves while trying to support customers hurt by coronavirus disruption, according to three people with knowledge of the discussions.
The European Central Bank this week urged lenders to use their liquidity reserves as buffers to support the economy and said it would allow them to fall short of some cash requirements, in what is rapidly becoming the first test of key liquidity rules introduced following the 2008 financial crisis. [L8N2B55GT]
The Fed has not said publicly whether it will also take a flexible stance, but the sources said Fed supervisors are encouraging lenders to use the same liquidity buffers to keep lending. They are also discussing with banks some degree of leniency if lenders' breach a key U.S. liquidity threshold.
Depending on the circumstances, that could mean giving the lender in question months to devise and execute a plan to slowly rebuild the buffer, the sources said.
That should be a comfort for airliners, cruise operators, hotel groups and entertainment companies, which are feeling revenue strain as governments globally ban travel and large events in a bid to arrest the spread of the flu-like virus. 
Airplane maker  Boeing Co  (N:BA), hotel operator  Hilton Worldwide  Holdings Inc (N:HLT) and theme park company SeaWorld Entertainment Inc (N:SEAS) are among the companies that drew on or upsized billions of dollars in credit lines this week amid growing market fears over a liquidity crunch. 
The Fed declined to comment on Friday.
In 2014, federal banking agencies adopted the Liquidity Coverage Ratio rule which requires banks to hold high-quality liquid assets, such as stocks and bonds, that match or exceed their projected net cash outflows over a 30-day stress period. 
This ratio, which is calculated daily, includes potential outflows from clients drawing on lending facilities. While the minimum ratio for big banks is 100%, most held ratios closer to or exceeding 120%, December 2019 bank filings show. 
If a big bank falls below the 100% threshold on any business day it must alert the Fed, and if it falls short for three consecutive business days it must swiftly give the Fed a plan for replenishing its liquid assets. In theory, the Fed could also bring an enforcement action against the bank.
The rule was designed to ensure banks can meet their liquidity obligations at times of stress, and it explicitly allows the Fed to be flexible when enforcing it. But lenders have nevertheless been wary of dipping into the buffers for fear of attracting adverse scrutiny from their supervisors or the market.
One of the sources with knowledge of the Fed's discussions with lenders said big banks were unlikely to be in a position yet where they need to dip below the 100% threshold, due to their robust liquidity ratios. But another of the sources said Fed supervisors and bank executives were discussing the degree of leeway the Fed may give lenders if this did eventually become necessary. 
Chair Jay Powell signaled a willingness to be flexible on the threshold in September when he told reporters the central bank would want lenders ""to use their liquidity buffers in times of stress rather than pull back from the markets and pull back from serving their clients.""
The third source, though, said banks would be more comfortable dipping into the buffers if the Fed made a formal statement urging them to do so.
Critics of the rule have argued strictly enforcing the ratio during times of market stress would exacerbate a liquidity crunch and hurt the economy as banks pull back from lending and scramble for the same liquid assets. 

Emergency lending to support businesses ""is what the Fed expects the banks to be doing,"" said David Fanger, Senior Vice President at Moody's.

Shares of the German drugs and pesticides company have come under immense pressure since it lost the first U.S. lawsuit claiming that glyphosate-based Roundup, acquired via its takeover of  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON) in 2018, causes cancer.
Last month, the company said it was in no rush to reach terms with plaintiffs' lawyers and was less inclined to set aside funds for any deal following recent U.S. decisions in its favor.
Bayer had also said that based on average analyst predictions of a settlement worth about $10 billion, the company would not have to write down the value of the $63 billion Monsanto acquisition.

1389,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 13, 2020 04:00PM ET</span>",Stocks - Dow Ends Week Lower Despite Trump-Infused Friday Rally,"By Yasin Ebrahim 
Investing.com – Wall Street ended the week down substantially despite a huge rally into the close on Friday after President Donald Trump declared a national emergency, a move that gives him authority to use federal funds to combat the coronavirus outbreak.
The S&P 500 soared 9.3% today. It was up 4.1% before the speech. The Nasdaq Composite gained 9.3%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average surged 9.4%, up 1,985 points. The S&P and Dow ended the week down 9% and 10% respectively.
Trump said the move would ""open access to up to $50 billion"" in funds for states and municipalities to tackle the pandemic.
The declaration from Trump was largely expected amid growing calls on Capitol Hill for the president to use the law to free up funds to assist Americans affected by the outbreak and ramp up testing.
The rebound in the broader market following its worst one-day rout since 1987 was driven by financials, mostly banks, underpinned by a rise in Treasury yields.
Banking stocks like JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), which benefit from the boost to net interest income form higher interest rose sharply, with the latter up more than 14%.
Tech was also up sharply as bargain-hunting investors piled into beaten-down FANG stocks, while chip stocks also enjoyed a strong rally, though ended the week down 9%.
Energy, one of the worst hit sectors, was given a boost as Trump said he had authorized refilling the U.S. strategic petroleum reserve ""right up to the top,"" a move that could provide some support for oil prices.
The strong end to the day on Wall Street comes during a week in which the Dow plunged to its biggest one-day percentage slump since 1987 on Thursday, despite the Federal Reserve pumping more than $1.5 billion of liquidity in the market. 
The Fed said it would conduct three $500 billion tranches of term repos - two for three-months and one for one-month - to support financial market functioning. The central bank has railed against suggestions that its monthly $60 billion T-bills purchases -- initiated in October last year to avert a repeat of a spike in overnight lending rates seen last September --  are a new form of quantitative easing because it as limited to short-term securities.  
But earlier this week the Fed extended those purchase “across a range of maturities” to include bills, notes, Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities as well as other instruments. 
Still, despite the monetary and fiscal stimulus measures seen this week, the future of the global economy remains bleak, with some on Wall Street warning of a virus-led recession.
""COVID-19 is expected to roll through the global economy over February, March, and April, generating GDP contractions in most countries for at least one of the two quarters it straddles,"" said Bruce Kasman, J.P. Morgan’s chief economist. ""If our current forecast is realized it seems appropriate to characterize it as a novel-global recession.""   "

(Reuters) - Wall Street clawed back some losses on Friday after its biggest one-day decline in three decades, as investors set their hopes on more global fiscal stimulus to stem a coronavirus-driven global recession.
All three main indexes jumped more than 6% in early trading before paring gains on reports President Donald Trump was set to declare a national emergency to contain the spread of the deadly pathogen.
The indexes were still about 25% below record highs hit in mid-February, and were on track for their biggest weekly declines since October 2008, the height of the financial crisis.
The Democratic-led U.S. House of Representatives will pass a coronavirus economic aid package on Friday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said, but it was unclear whether Trump and his fellow Republicans would support it.
Given the steep declines on Thursday - the biggest one-day percentage drop since ""Black Monday"" in October 1987 - investors were hoping for a stronger bounce-back in today's session. 
""We should have seen significantly more volume, significantly more positive price action, breadth in the market today given the sell-off that we saw specifically yesterday,"" said Peter Kenny, founder of Kenny’s Commentary LLC and Strategic Board Solutions LLC in New York. 
""It isn’t there, and that is an indication we are not even close to being out of the woods.""
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) rose 833.72 points, or 3.93%, to 22,034.34, the S&P 500 (SPX) gained 93.62 points, or 3.77%, to 2,574.26 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) added 257.23 points, or 3.57%, to 7,459.04.
All the main S&P 500 sub-indexes were trading higher, with financial stocks (SPSY) rising 6.94% as expectations of further liquidity measures by the Federal Reserve pushed up Treasury yields, in what has become a very thin market.
Oil also looked set to end the week with a silver lining, as both Brent  and WTI crude  settled higher after a near-collapse in prices on Monday due to a price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia. The S&P 500 energy index (SPNY) added 1.66%.
Travel stocks, hammered in the rout, were trading higher, with the S&P 1500 airlines index <.SPCOMAIR> up 3.66% 
Hotel operators Marriott International Inc (O:MAR),  Hilton Worldwide  Holdings (N:HLT) and  Hyatt Hotels Corp  (N:H) all gained at least 1%.
 Boeing Co  (N:BA) jumped 7.98% but was still on track for its biggest weekly drop in its history on rising concerns about the company's growing cash burn. 
Apple Inc (O:AAPL) rose 4.97% and was among the top boosts to the benchmark S&P 500 and the blue-chip Dow, as the iPhone maker said it would reopen all 42 of its branded stores in China.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 3.18-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.02-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

The S&P 500 posted no new 52-week highs and 118 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded two new highs and 656 new lows.

1392,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 13, 2020 03:34PM ET</span>",Teleconference apps and new tech surge in demand amid coronavirus outbreak,"By Akanksha Rana and Arriana McLymore
(Reuters) - Global downloads of business apps including Tencent Conference, WeChat Work, Zoom, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) Teams and Slack have risen nearly five fold since the start of the year, data showed, as the coronavirus outbreak changes how corporations work.
While such apps attracted 1.4 million new users across the App Store and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Play in the first week of January, that figure jumped to a record 6.7 million in the first week of March, according to app analytics firm Sensor Tower.
The outbreak, which reached global pandemic status this week, has forced companies to rely heavily on business conferencing tools as workers stop commuting to offices.
These services range from video conferencing apps such as Zoom and Google Hangouts Meet to cutting edge tools inspired by ""Star Wars"" to make remote work more manageable.
Some of these newer services such as Rumii and Spatial, which let users attend meetings in digital rooms where they can see and interact with digitized, 3D versions of their coworkers.
Zoom Video Communications Inc's daily active user base grew by 67% since early January, data from Apptopia showed. Analysts, however, warn that not every business app would see a corresponding financial gain from the demand surge.
""Most of them offer a freemium version so why would users pay when they can use for free,"" Summit Insights Group analyst Jonathan Kees said, pointing to services like Microsoft Teams and Zoom, which recently expanded their free offerings.
Zoom last week said it had seen a jump in usage, but added it was early to say whether such users will convert into paying customers.
Shares of the company have surged more than 60% since the beginning of this year, even as broader markets have been volatile on fears that the fast-spreading virus could lead to a global recession.
VIRTUAL REALITY
Rumii, a virtual reality training and education platform by Doghead Simulations, which costs $14.99 per month per user, last week began offering its services for free after noticing an uptick in use as the coronavirus spread in the United States.
New York-based augmented reality software company Spatial also saw usage of its service double over the last month.
Spatial Chief Executive Officer Anand Agarawala said that coronavirus concerns have led to a 400% surge in requests for the company's licenses in the last month and a 50% increase in usage within the past week.
Some analysts say the accelerated adoption of business apps cannot be dismissed as a blip.
""We have to consider that some of these changes may be irreversible, when (hopefully) things return to normal,"" DA Davidson analyst Rishi Jaluria said.
""You'll see more companies adopting these technologies and using them on a regular basis. So the benefit is more long-term in nature."""

1394,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 13, 2020 02:46PM ET</span>",Explainer: Dollar demand reveals market's pain point,"By Tommy Wilkes and Saikat Chatterjee
LONDON (Reuters) - This month's dramatic selloff in financial markets is causing ructions in vital funding markets that keep money flowing between banks and companies and underpin anything from global trade to corporate cashflow.
In an eerie throwback to the dark days of the 2008 financial crisis when credit markets froze, the price banks and companies are willing to pay to access U.S. dollars has surged as coronavirus panic has taken hold. Banks are now charging more to lend to each other than they were last week.
The following explains how these esoteric funding markets work, why stresses in the financial architecture are emerging, and what can be done to resolve them.
WHY AND WHEN DO LIQUIDITY STRESSES ARISE?
Market 'liquidity' is the ease with which you can buy and sell a financial asset. In normal times, investors will hold a range of securities from hard-to-sell corporate loans to highly liquid government bonds like U.S. Treasuries or dollar cash.
When markets suffer dramatic price falls as we have seen this month, investors dump riskier assets and seek safety in the most liquid places that will hold their value and be exchanged quickly.
The same is true for companies. With economies set to contract and revenues shrinking as the spread of the coronavirus dampens activity and disrupts supply chains, businesses short of cash will seek to draw down loan facilities quickly or clamor for safe assets as they ride out the storm.
Yet the dash for liquidity can cause major disruptions.
Traders in the U.S. Treasury market, typically one of the world's most liquid markets, have at times this week found it difficult to trade, a highly unusual scenario that reflects the scale of the dislocations.
That illiquidity can arise because of duration mismatches, i.e. because leveraged investors would borrow in these markets and invest them in relatively higher yielding bonds such as U.S. government debt.
Though these bonds mature over years, they are funded by cash raised from overnight markets and any increase in borrowing costs would force them to unwind these transactions rapidly, affecting market liquidity.
Spreads on three-month euro-dollar and dollar-yen swap spreads - gauges for how much premium non-U.S. borrowers are prepared to pay to get dollars - on Thursday hit their widest since 2017.
(Graphic: Shadow of 2008 financial crisis looms over dollar funding markets - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/3405/3366/funding.png)
What worries markets is that the shock could take on a life of its own.
As dollars become harder to come by, cash-rich companies and banks hoard them more than usual, further exacerbating the crunch.
WHY ONLY DOLLARS?
The dollar's central role in this system is mainly due to the fact that its dominance in global commerce remains unrivalled.
It is by far the most widely used currency for loans and international trade, and many of the biggest commodities, such as oil and gold, are dollar denominated.
According to The Bank for International Settlements, the dollar was on one side of 88% of all foreign exchange trades in 2019 and comprised of one leg in 91% of the $3.2 trillion-a-day market for FX swaps and forwards.

(Graphic: Currency distribution of OTC FX turnover - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/GLOBAL-FOREX-BIS/0H001QX6V8EM/eikon.png)
Governments, financial institutions and companies all borrow in dollars - and they need the greenback to pay those debts.
European Union statistics office Eurostat, for example, says that over half of all goods imports were invoiced in dollars in 2016. Close to half of all cross-border claims were denominated in dollars in 2017, according to Eurostat.
While Japan and Europe have deep markets, comparative demand for euros and yen via swap markets is tiny compared to dollars because the interest rate differentials between U.S. bonds and these markets heavily favor the dollar.
WHAT ARE MONEY MARKETS AND HOW DO THEY WORK?
Borrowers requiring dollars have the option of borrowing directly in U.S. money markets or raising funds in alternative currencies and exchanging them into dollars using FX swaps.
The plumbing of the financial system in effect, money markets are often central to any credit crisis or cash crunch. They froze in the 2007/2008 U.S. mortgage crisis and again in the 2011/2012 euro zone crisis as banks stopped lending to each other and many were locked out of wholesale lending markets.
Since then, volumes of FX swaps have swelled as an alternative way to access dollars.

(Graphic: OTC foreign exchange turnover - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/GLOBAL-FOREX-BIS/0H001QX6T8EJ/eikon.png)
In normal circumstances, there should be no difference between the implied interest rate of borrowing dollars in these markets and the borrowing cost in U.S. money markets.
But what recent crises demonstrated was that non-U.S. banks are willing to pay a premium for dollars in offshore markets.
That spread differential otherwise known as basis, can widen to levels so big it smacks of shortages, cascading panic into wider markets that feeds back into a further widening in borrowing costs.
Analysts say the recent spread widening is not indicative of a full blown panic yet but reflects broad-based selling in risky assets despite the billions of dollars pumped by global central banks this week.
SIGNS OF STRESS
Spreads on three-month euro-dollar and dollar-yen swap spreads, the two most liquid swap contracts in the world, widened to their highest since 2017 on Thursday.
Spreads widened by nearly 40 bps on Thursday, the biggest single-day rise since December 2008. They now stand at 72 bps compared to 160 bps during the European debt crisis in 2011/12 and to more than 300 bps during the 2008/09 meltdown.
HOW DO YOU END THE STRESS?
Recent financial crises have taught central bankers that typical responses to massive market selloffs in the form of interest rate cuts aren't not enough.
In the past, central banks have injected billions of dollars via overnight funding to financial institutions. This week alone, the New York Federal Reserve surprised markets by pumping $1.5 trillion into the banking system.
Emerging market central banks' responses have varied from cutting banks' reserve requirements, or the minimum amount of funds that lenders have to hold with the central bank, to extending FX swaps directly to banks to meet dollar needs, as India has done.
To make sure those dollars are available, the Fed has standing agreements with five major foreign central banks from Canada, the European Central Bank, Japan, Britain and Switzerland that allows them to provide dollars to their financial institutions during times of stress.
While latest weekly data on Thursday showed only $58 million in liquidity being provided to foreign central banks, compared to the billions during the crisis, analysts expect this number to rise dramatically if funding shortfalls worsen.

Investing.com – The Dow's attempt to resume its rebound toward session highs on Friday was cut short somewhat after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the House will pass a bill to ramp up testing of the novel coronavirus, but stopped short of signalling any progress on a deal with the White House over proposals.    
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 3%, or 628 points, but had been as high as 1,000 ahead of the speech. The S&P 500 added  2.4% and the Nasdaq Composite gained 2.3%.
Pelosi, in a statement at 2 PM ET (18:00 GMT), said legistlation expected to be passed today would provide free coronavirus testing, including for the uninsured, provide two weeks of sick leave and bolster unemployment insurance and food lunch programs.
The speech arrived after two days of intense talks with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin over an economic aid package at time when infections in the country continue to jump. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell had called the Democratic package an idealogical wishlist.  
The number of infections in the New York state has surged by more by 30% overnight to 421, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Friday."

NEW YORK/MADRID (Reuters) - As virus-wary shoppers stayed home in the United States and Europe, apparel retailers braced for a blow to sales and a potential inventory glut. Some slashed orders at garment factories while others began discounting merchandise.
U.S. retailers including Macy's Inc (N:M), Saks Fifth Avenue and Gap Inc.'s (N:GPS) Banana Republic sent notices to shoppers late Thursday saying they were open for business in a move to stem losses due to a steep decline in traffic.
In Europe, Zara owner  Inditex  (MC:ITX) said on Friday it would temporarily close stores in the areas of Spain worst affected by the coronavirus, including Madrid. In Italy, most shops were shuttered on Wednesday.
In New York, stores in some of the world's most heavily visited shopping districts like Fifth Avenue and Madison Avenue were practically empty on Friday despite pleas to customers.
""Our stores are open for business and continue to be a safe place for you to shop,"" Saks President Marc Metrick said in an email to shoppers late Thursday.
Kohl's Corp (N:KSS) said it had experienced softer demand, especially in areas most affected by coronavirus. On Thursday, Gap Inc. said it expected a $100 million revenue hit this quarter due to the coronavirus outbreak.
LVMH's (PA:LVMH) Sephora beauty chain, Ulta Beauty (O:ULTA) and MAC Cosmetics, owned by  Estee Lauder  Companies Inc (N:EL), have all ordered employees to cancel makeovers of customers, to avoid touching faces with hands, which can spread the virus.
At specialty and fashion apparel stores in the United States, retail transaction velocity, a measure of sales, fell nearly 10% from Feb. 15 to March 9 from its year earlier level, according to a Customer Growth Partners LLC report.
In China, the world's biggest apparel-buying market, consumer demand remains a major concern even as shoppers begin to venture out of quarantine.
NO APPETITE
Further up the supply chain in Bangladesh, the world's second-biggest apparel manufacturer after China, brands are asking for cuts in orders of up to 30% and seeking discounts, said Rubana Huq, head of the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association.
Even as retailers begin to repair broken supply chains due to recently closed Chinese factories, they must now scramble to avoid a glut of unsold stock.
""Our supply chain is not the issue and it's not the concern. It is consumer demand in an environment where you have 80% of the stores being closed,"" Adidas (DE:ADSGN) Chief Executive Officer Kasper Rorsted told analysts on Wednesday.
Adidas, which makes nearly a third of its sales in Asia, said it would clear excess inventory in China by selling stock at a discount in outlet stores.
H&M said on Friday it was in close contact with its suppliers and evaluating the situation together with them.
""I usually do shop half online and half in stores, but I am avoiding malls and stores for the last few weeks,"" said Sarah P., 42, of Rockville, Maryland, a legal assistant who requested that her last name not be used.
She said that prior to taking a break from going out and shopping, she spent most her dollars at  Nordstrom Inc  (N:JWN), Macy's, J. Crew, Banana Republic, Sephora, and Zara stores.
""It started because of flu and cold, but now it is nonnegotiable with coronavirus. Too risky."" Luxury leather goods maker Salvatore Ferragamo, known for its Vara shoe and Ferragamo Studio bag, said it had started shifting products between regions. ""Of course when the virus starts spreading everywhere that becomes much more difficult,"" Chief Financial Officer Alessandro Corsi told analysts on Tuesday, adding any discounts would be strategic so as not to tarnish the cachet of its star products.
The bottom line is that slump in demand for apparel and accessories that happened in China had now spread to the rest of the world said Siddiqur Rahman, a Dhaka-based garment exporter who supplies brands like H&M (ST:HMb), C&A, Gap, Walmart (N:WMT) and Mango.
""There is no appetite for garments from European and American brands. Cities are locked down. Who will buy clothing?"" he said."

NEW YORK/BOSTON/LONDON (Reuters) - Bridgewater Associates LP, the Ray Dalio-led hedge fund giant famous for making money during the 2008 financial crisis, has posted mixed returns amid the coronavirus-led market turmoil, according to an investor with direct knowledge of the performance.
Bridgewater's flagship hedge fund, Pure Alpha II, declined 2.4% over the first six days of March, leaving it down 10.6% for the year, the investor said. Major Markets, another large fund, was also down about 12% for 2020 through March 6, the person said.
Both so-called macro funds, which bet on a broad array of global securities based on macroeconomic trends, generally came into the market correction short bonds and long equities, twin losing bets, the person said. More recent performance was unavailable.
Bridgewater's All Weather fund fared better with a gain of 2.5% year-to-date through March 6, the investor said. The fund, which practices a so-called risk parity strategy to automatically proportion bets on major asset classes, has essentially been long both bonds and equities. High quality bonds have rallied as equity investors sought their relative safety from plunging stocks.
Greg Jensen, the Westport, Connecticut-based firm's co-chief investment officer, said on Feb. 26 that Bridgewater was weighing how likely it was for the coronavirus shock to impact credit, which would have more serious long-term economic implications.
""The main question ... is really a function of whether it flows into the credit system,"" Jensen said in a video interview posted online https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0r2X0FmZtg by Bridgewater.
Bridgewater, the largest hedge fund manager in the world at $160 billion, is trusted by large investors globally to help produce steady returns no matter what the market environment. Its Pure Alpha fund famously gained about 9.5% in 2008, a year when most investors were walloped by the housing-led financial crisis. Pure Alpha, which posted a flat return last year, has produced net annualized returns of 11.1% since inception; All Weather gained 16.6% last year and has an average annual gain of 7.7%, according to a person familiar with the performance.
Other macro hedge fund managers have fared better this year.
London-based Brevan Howard's listed hedge fund, BH Macro, made gains of 6.8% this month through March 6 and is up 11% year-to-date, according to a recent filing.
Gávea Investimentos, a Brazil-based macro manager, posted an estimated 1.24% gain this year through February aided by short positions in Asian and Mexican currencies and fixed income bets in Canada, Australia and Brazil, according to an investor letter seen by Reuters. The fund is up another 1.8% so far in March as of Thursday, bringing the year-to-date total to nearly 3%, according to a person close to the firm.
Other macro fund gains over the first two months of the year, according to investors and a report by the HSBC Alternative Investment Group, include MKP Enhanced Opportunity Offshore fund (up 5.2%); Kirkoswald Asset Management (up 6.3%); Horseman Global Fund (up 10.2%); and Caxton Global Investment (up 5.28%)
Representatives for the funds did not immediately return requests seeking comment.
A London-based hedge fund investment consultant said that macro funds had mostly bet against stocks and for fixed income, a winning combination.
""Lots of macro managers have done really well,"" said the person, who requested anonymity because the performance was private. ""As markets have continued to fall, rates have continued to fall as well and these managers have kept their positions."""

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's banks have asked the Bank of England to scrap this year's stress test of lenders and to soften rules to help them cushion expected losses as the coronavirus pandemic hits their staff and customers, banking sources said on Friday.
""It would be stupid to run a stress test during a stress,"" a senior banker told Reuters. ""Let's concentrate on this situation rather than a hypothetical one.""
The central bank's Financial Policy Committee, which monitors risks in the financial system, typically agrees scenarios for the annual test of banks' resilience at its first quarter meeting and publishes them on March 24.
Results usually come out at the end of year.
Top bankers met Britain's finance minister Rishi Sunak and Bank of England Governor Mark Carney on Thursday to discuss action to help smaller businesses hit by coronavirus. Andrew Bailey, who takes over from Carney on Monday, was present.
A second banking source said scrapping the stress tests was one of several support measures discussed with the central bank.
The BoE declined to comment on the stress test. The Treasury said it was a matter for the BoE.
After allowing banks to fully tap a special buffer of capital to support lending this week, the central bank's Financial Policy Committee is expected to review whether to go ahead with the stress test.
The European Union regulators on Thursday said the bloc's own test that was under way had been postponed until 2022.
Banks have also asked Sunak and Carney for relief from an accounting rule that forces them to provision early for loans at risk of turning sour, the two sources said.
Bankers are concerned a mandatory international accounting rule, known as IFRS 9 and which was introduced in 2018, will force them to book bad loans earlier than in previous crises, likely exacerbating early bank losses and hits to capital.
Sunak and Carney were told it could deter lenders from providing necessary relief to struggling businesses and consumers, if the banks feared hefty provisions.
""Don't force banks to do things that are unhelpful ... How do you avoid that double whammy?"" the banker said.
The BoE has repeatedly said the British banking sector is holding enough capital.
Banks are already being forced to adapt to how they operate to minimize potential infections from the virus.
HSBC (L:HSBA) told all staff in Britain on Friday to avoid traveling between its offices, practice social distancing measures and work from home where possible."

(Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson is seeing a spike in demand for its Tylenol over-the-counter pain killer and other self-care products, the company said on Friday, as the global spread of the coronavirus prompts people to stock up on essentials.
The company, which also makes Band-Aid and Listerine mouth wash, said it was shipping its stock in a ""controlled manner"" and that its manufacturing sites had ramped up production to ensure supply.
J&J said it did not anticipate a shortage of Tylenol, a commonly used drug for headache and fever, even though the drug ""may have temporarily run out of stock at one location"".
Fears around shortages of some drugs emerged after the coronavirus outbreak wreaked havoc on supply chains and were amplified last week after India, the world's main supplier of generic drugs, restricted the export of some ingredients as well as medicines including paracetamol, known as Tylenol in the United States.
J&J also said it was taking all possible measures to maximize the availability of its consumer products.
The coronavirus, which originated in Wuhan, China last year, has spread to more than 100 countries and killed more than 5,000 people worldwide, sparking a rush for everyday items ranging from toilet paper to packaged foods.
Pharmacy chain Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) Inc and supermarket chain Kroger (NYSE:KR) Co on Thursday placed purchase limits to stabilize inventory.
Kroger placed a limit on the number of cold, flu and sanitary products per order, while Walgreens said it was limiting disinfectant wipes and cleaners, face masks, hand sanitizers, thermometers and gloves to four each per customer.
The company also said majority of its global medical device manufacturing was running at or near normal capacity, and that it does not expect the outbreak to cause any disruptions to its supply of medicines.
J&J said it had business continuity plans in place across its global supply chain network, including maintaining inventory at distribution centers away from high-risk areas and said it was monitoring demand and supply levels."

European equities all but gave up gains on Friday after a report that U.S. President Donald Trump plans to declare a national emergency over the virus outbreak overshadowed optimism on policy responses in Europe.
The Stoxx 600 Index ended the session with up 1.4%, after earlier rallying as much as 8.8% as Germany pledged to spend “billions” to help cushion the blow from the pandemic. Trump plans to declare a national emergency, invoking an act that will open the door to more federal aid for states and municipalities, people familiar with the matter said, before a scheduled news conference at 3 p.m. in Washington.
The Italian FTSE MIB Index was an outperformer, though it more than halved earlier gains. Germany’s DAX Index was up 0.8% after briefly erasing gains that reached 9% at one point. Travel and leisure stocks were the biggest decliners, down 2.4%, on worries over the impact of restrictions on freedom of movement on businesses.
“Until volatility starts coming down, we recommend investors maintain a cautious stance,” Alastair Pinder, a global equity strategist at HSBC Securities, said by phone. “We remain cautious on Europe and despite the sell-off, it’s not the right time to be going into buying European equities.”
European stocks plummeted the most on record on Thursday, after a U.S. travel ban and an underwhelming European Central Bank response did little to calm investors seeking a strong, coordinated effort to deal with the pandemic’s impact on global growth.
Indications from Germany that it will abandon its long-standing balanced-budget policy if necessary appeared to help sentiment earlier today, while a European Union executive said the bloc is ready to trigger a crisis clause allowing fiscal stimulus.
Among notable movers, Roche Holding (SIX:ROG) AG advanced after the Swiss drugmaker won approval from the U.S. government for a highly automated coronavirus test.

1406,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 13, 2020 01:06PM ET</span>","GM, Ford to have white-collar employees work remotely starting Monday","By Ben Klayman and David Shepardson
DETROIT/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. automakers General Motors Co (N:GM) and  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) said on Friday they will have most of their white-collar workforce working remotely as of Monday to protect against the spread of the coronavirus.
GM Chief Executive Mary Barra told employees on Friday the No. 1 automaker is asking all employees and contract workers to work remotely, noting the company has faced crises before. 
""For many of us, it’s our first experience of this type. But disruption and trying circumstances are not new to us,"" she said in an email.
Barra said the remote-work policy applied globally apart from China, which has existing protocols in place. “Our IT tools and systems have been extensively stress-tested; it’s vital that we leverage them to continue delivering,” she said. 
Ford will shift most of its global white-collar workforce outside China, where recovery has begun, to working remotely, CEO James Hackett said in an email to employees.
""In recent days ... we’ve concluded the coronavirus issue has taken on a different dimension – and we need to be proactive to keep our people safe and help limit the spread of the virus in the communities where we live and work,"" he said. 
Italian-American automaker  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles NV (MI:FCHA) (N:FCAU) (FCA) also is accelerating its deployment of remote work for white-collar employees beyond the most affected countries of China, South Korea, Japan and Italy, CEO Mike Manley said in a letter to employees seen by Reuters on Friday.
Ford's Hackett told employees that in the event a worker tests positive for the virus they will be told to get medical attention and self quarantine at home. Ford will identify others who may have been in contact with that person and instruct them to seek medical attention and self quarantine for 14 days.
He added Ford will close any facility exposed to a confirmed case, and a spokeswoman confirmed that includes manufacturing plants.
However, Ford has seen ""limited"" impact to its global operations due to the epidemic, with some employees testing positive for the virus in China and Germany but none so far in the United States, spokesman Mark Truby said. 
The No. 2 U.S. automaker has not lost any vehicle production outside of China and it is taking steps to keep its plants operating, he said. However, some parts of the U.S. market have seen customer traffic at dealers hurt by the outbreak, he added.
On Thursday, FCA said an employee at its Indiana transmission plant had tested positive for COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus, but he was being treated and the plant was still operating while anyone exposed to that worker was quarantined.
Manley said in the letter to employees on Thursday that FCA is focused on worker safety and keeping its plants running.
""Clearly, we are now moving beyond regional hotspots and into planning for how this will impact every area of our business across the world,"" he said.
Changes include allowing for greater space between employees at several plants, and stepping up cleaning and availability of face masks, Manley said. 
FCA said this week it was temporarily halting operations at some Italian plants and would reduce production rates in response to the outbreak.

Investing.com – The Dow remained off highs Friday amid growing fears the rapid spread of the coronavirus will plunge the world economy into a recession, even as global financial institutions have rolled out stimulus measures.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 2.79%, or 595  points, after rallying as many as 1,339 points. The S&P 500 added 2.94%, The Nasdaq Composite gained 2.72%.
With the spread of the novel coronavirus, or Covid-19, particularly in Europe and U.S., feared to intensify in the coming weeks rather reach a peak, investor sentiment on stocks remained fragile.
""More cases are now being reported (in Europe) every day than were reported in China at the height of its epidemic,” WHO Director-General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said at a press conference at the organization’s Geneva headquarters.
In the U.S., meanwhile, infections have jumped to more than 1,600. President Donald Trump reportedly will declare a national emergency over the coronavirus pandemic in a speech schedule for 3 PM ET (19:00 GMT) today.
With virus outbreak killing more than 5,000 people and reported cases topping 400,000 worldwide, recession fears are gathering pace.
""COVID-19 is expected to roll through the global economy over February, March, and April, generating GDP contractions in most countries for at least one of the two quarters it straddles,"" said Bruce Kasman, J.P. Morgan’s chief economist. ""If our current forecast is realized it seems appropriate to characterize it as a novel-global recession.""
The rebound in the broader market following its worst one-day slump since 1987 was driven by financials, mostly banks, underpinned by a rise in Treasury yields.
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) rose sharply, with the latter up more than 7%.
But energy proved an exception to the rally, despite a slight rise in oil prices, as investor feared gains will likely be capped by a plunge in demand for travel."

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada is weighing a multi-billion dollar aid package for industries hit hardest by the coronavirus outbreak, such as the tourism, energy and hospitality sectors, a source directly familiar with the matter said on Friday.
Such an aid package would help Canada's 10 provinces take their own action to provide relief for families, workers and employers, said the source, who requested anonymity given the sensitivity of the situation.
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Wednesday said his Liberal government would spent an initial C$1 billion to fight the outbreak and made clear he was ready to do more.
The source said government officials were ""talking in the many billions"" and that the total value of an aid package could be up to C$20 billion across the country.
Some Bay Street economists in Toronto say that while an aid package might not prevent a recession, it would help ease the economic pain.
Ottawa was also open to the idea of supporting major airlines such as  Air Canada  (TO:AC) and privately held WestJet, said the source.
Firms in Canada's already-struggling energy sector have slashed investment as panic over the outbreak spreads and oil prices sink as Saudi Arabia ramps up production.
Alberta Premier Jason Kenney on Wednesday said oil and gas firms would soon start laying off workers and insisted Ottawa provide financial help.
No one in the office of Finance Minister Bill Morneau was immediately available for comment. CTV television said earlier that Morneau was due to speak to the media on Friday."

The Commission said it had had concerns that the transaction would have reduced competition in the markets for military GPS receivers and airborne radios.
To address these concerns, UTC and Raytheon offered to divest UTC's entire military GPS receiver and anti-jamming business located in Iowa and Raytheon's entire military airborne radios business, based in Indiana

The S&P 500 was about 1.5% higher mid-morning after climbing 6% at the open, following stocks’ worst day since 1987. Treasury yields increased as the Federal Reserve said it was buying $37 billion of bonds across maturities and President Donald Trump planned to declare a national emergency.
European equities also advanced, the dollar strengthened and stress in the credit markets showed some signs of easing. Precious metals fell, with palladium set for its worst week on record.
After days of no or inadequate action, policy prescriptions came fast Friday but it was unclear if they would be enough. Congress was said to be near a deal on a relief bill. The European Union prepared to suspend government spending rules, and regulators in Italy and Spain banned short-selling on some stocks. China’s central bank said it would pump in $79 billion to bolster the economy.
The moves buoyed market sentiment battered by the spread of the virus and a spate of travel restrictions, school closings and event cancellations. But bears cautioned that the rebound was preordained and may not stick.
After each of the 10 worst days in S&P 500 history, the average return has been a gain of 2.94%. The Cboe Volatility Index dropped after its fourth-highest close on record. Such spikes in the VIX have always been followed by sharp rallies.
Other markets remained exceptionally volatile. Ten-year Treasuries swung from earlier gains to losses. Sovereign bonds sank across most of Europe for a second day amid criticism of European Central Bank measures to address the pandemic. Oil pushed higher and the dollar headed for its best week since 2016.
“It’s possible we’re just recovering a portion of yesterday’s losses on the idea that there were no terrible headlines this morning,” said Susquehanna Financial Group strategist Christopher Jacobsen. “The market had priced in the extreme dour outcome and the lack of newsflow this morning to confirm that worst-case scenario resulted in just a bit of a relief rally.”
Even with Friday’s gains, global equities are heading for their worst week since 2008 as investors price in a severely weaker economic outlook as cases continue to grow across the world and restrictions on people and businesses crush sentiment. The Bank of Japan on Friday followed an earlier move from the Federal Reserve to inject liquidity.
“It seems that the more severe things become in the short term, the more extreme will be the fiscal and monetary policy response,” Mark Dowding, chief investment officer at BlueBay Asset Management, wrote to investors. “It is very conceivable that the full boost from such measures will only really kick in just as activity rebounds, with pent up demand leading to a turbo-charged recovery in the second half of the year in the wake of an economic contraction in the context of the first half.”

(Reuters) - Warren Buffett on Friday said the coronavirus pandemic forced him to cancel Berkshire Hathaway Inc's (N:BRKa) annual shareholder weekend, the largest gathering in corporate America, because the safety of participants and the wider community was paramount.
The weekend, which Berkshire's billionaire chairman calls ""Woodstock for Capitalists"" and normally attracts more than 40,000 people, had been scheduled for May 1-3 in several locations across Omaha, Nebraska, where Berkshire is based.
Buffett said ""events have moved very fast"" since he discussed the weekend in his Feb. 22 shareholder letter.
Berkshire's annual meeting will still be live-streamed on May 2 on Yahoo (NASDAQ:AABA) Finance, but shareholders cannot physically attend, and surrounding events have been canceled. Omaha has about 468,000 people.
""Large gatherings can pose a health threat to the participants and the greater community,"" Buffett said. ""We won't ask this of our employees and we won't expose Omaha to the possibility of becoming a 'hot spot' in the current pandemic.""
Buffett's hand was forced after the World Health Organization on Wednesday declared the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic, countries and cities worldwide curbed large gatherings, and many companies canceled events or moved them online.
Omaha this year also will not host the College World Series of baseball, which the NCAA canceled on Thursday, for the first time since it moved there in 1950.
Berkshire's annual meeting normally lasts about 15 minutes, but is preceded by five hours in which Buffett, 89, and Vice Chairman Charlie Munger, 96, answer shareholder questions. Buffett said he and possibly Munger may still field some questions.
Health experts consider elderly people the most at risk of dying from the coronavirus. 
The weekend has long been a high point for Buffett, who routinely mingles in close proximity to shareholders and fans, often with a horde of media nearby.
Events this year were expected to include a cocktail reception filling a shopping mall, a 5-kilometer (3.1-mile) run, and shopping discounts that provide Berkshire with millions of dollars of revenue.
Only about a dozen people attended Berkshire's annual meeting in 1965, the year Buffett took over the company.
Attendance surged after Berkshire in 1996 introduced Class B shares, now worth 1/1500th of Class A shares, enabling more people to make pilgrimages to Omaha.
By 2015, there were 42,000 attendees helping Buffett celebrate his 50th anniversary at the helm.
The meeting and shareholder questions have since 2004 been conducted at the downtown CHI Health Center arena, which holds close to 19,000 people and normally fills to capacity.
Buffett expressed hope the weekend will return in 2021.

""Charlie and I will miss you, but we will see many thousands of you next year,"" he told shareholders.

ZURICH/NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued emergency authorization for a faster coronavirus test made by Swiss diagnostics maker Roche (S:ROG) and allowed New York state to authorize certain labs to test for the virus, moves aimed at boosting screening capacity to help contain the growing epidemic.
U.S. testing was hampered by flawed kits distributed by the federal government in February, which gave some false results. That has set the country back in containing an outbreak that has infected more than 122,000 people worldwide and more than 1,660 in the United States.
The ramp-up has also been slowed due to regulatory hurdles, as well as logistical and technical challenges, despite the entrance of commercial lab companies Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings (N:LH) and Quest Diagnostics Inc (N:DGX), according to healthcare providers, public health officials and test makers.
""The system is not really geared to what we need right now,"" Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Disease, said in a congressional briefing on Thursday. ""That is a failing. Let's admit it,"" he said.
""The idea of anybody getting it easily the way people in other countries are doing it, we're not set up for that.""
The new Roche tests provide results in 3.5 hours and can produce up to 4,128 results daily, the Basel-based company said on Friday, a boost to tests the company has offered until now.
The FDA's Emergency Use Authorization clears the way for tests to be deployed in the United States and markets accepting the CE mark showing they conform to European standards.
In New York, labs that are authorized by the New York state's health department will not have to get authorization from the FDA. They will only interact with New York's health department, which should speed up the availability of testing there, the FDA said.
GOING TO THE LIMITS
Roche said it is ""going to the limits of our production capacity"" to deliver as many of the faster tests as possible.
""The virus is infecting people in an exponential way. We knew we had to go to the high through-put systems,"" Roche Diagnostics head Thomas Schinecker said in an interview. ""This will help isolate patients who are infected, so you can keep the others healthy.""
The tests are for two diagnostics systems: Roche's cobas 6800, which can process 1,440 samples per day, and its faster cobas 8800, which can do more than 4,100. Worldwide, there are 695 cobas 6800 systems installed and 132 of the 8800s, with ""more than 100"" in the United States, Roche said.
Schinecker said Roche is in talks with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) over deploying more systems where they are most needed, including Washington state, where 31 of the nation's 41 deaths have occurred.
The University of Washington School of Medicine has boosted capacity to 1,000 tests daily, but its labs have also faced supply chain issues, including too few people available to pick up specimens and take them to labs, officials there have said."
1418,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 13, 2020 09:52AM ET</span>",‘Coming to a Head’: Investors React to Market Chaos,"(Bloomberg) -- On the last day of a historic week for global markets, there’s little sign of an end to the volatility that roiled bonds and currencies and sent stocks to their steepest plunge since the depths of the global financial crisis.
Mounting concerns that the coronavirus pandemic will spark a worldwide recession fueled a fresh round of selling in Asia on Friday. The slide triggered trading halts in Thailand, South Korea and Indonesia, while Japanese equities sank as much as 10%. Some policy makers rushed to limit wild fluctuations in currencies and sovereign debt.
Here’s what strategists and investors are saying about the market turmoil:
Coming to a Head
“This is all coming to a head very rapidly,” said Brian Barish, chief investment officer in Denver at Cambiar Investors LLC, which manages about $14 billion. “Markets are making it loud and clear that a business-as-usual approach is untenable. We are buying cosmetics and booze and select industrial businesses with pretty durable forms of demand. We have not developed the courage as of yet to jump on airlines or hotels. But maybe getting close with those.”
“At this point, no sane investor should be concerned with 2020 earnings - they are cooked! - but with getting through to the other side of this.”
‘Too Late’ for Hedges...
“It’s simply too late to engage in new long volatility hedge strategies,” said Peter Cecchini, global chief market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald LP. “Equity markets tend not to move in a straight line. We’d be monetizing hedges aggressively. Both the volatility surface and index technical setups suggest this action is prudent.”
“All the factors we look at are extreme and point to a near-term bounce, including spot VIX at the highest since 2008. We still maintain a sell-the-rally mindset, as fair value on the S&P remains roughly 2,450 on a base case but with significant risk to a downside overshoot.”
...So Try This
“While there is no free lunch, investors are seeking cost mitigation as hedges become more and more expensive,” said Amy Wu Silverman, equity derivatives strategist at RBC Capital Markets.
Selling a call spread while buying a put spread “still allows investors to retain upside should we get a sharp reversal (e.g. we have found a Coronavirus cure); meanwhile, it provides a wide expanse of protection on the downside.”
Dangerous Times
“The toxic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic’s bursting of the Fed’s ‘everything bubble’ has collided with the grotesquely over-leveraged and vulnerable U.S. corporate sector -- this puts equity markets in an even more vulnerable position,” said Albert Edwards, a strategist at  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) SA known for his bearish views.
“With an anomalously low testing rate the U.S. will as a consequence suffer a high headline death rate, although the true death rate will be no worse than elsewhere. The big death rate headlines will likely hit consumer confidence very hard indeed and deepen an already likely deep recession and equity market collapse, potentially causing a significant backlash against the current U.S. administration. These are dangerous times indeed.”
‘Close to’ Bazooka
“While the market may have been disappointed that Trump did not break out the bazooka last night, the reality is the Fed came close to doing that today -- though the market remained unimpressed,” said RBC Capital Markets LLC economists Tom Porcelli and Jacob Oubina. “They promised to do $500 billion each in 1-mo and 3-mo repos for the foreseeable future and they are going to expand Treasury purchases beyond bills. For a market focused on liquidity issues, this is good first step. We continue to hear that liquidity is terrible in off-the-run Treasuries so by expanding their purchases beyond bills, they no doubt hope to alleviate that issue. The problem is, spreading around the $60 billion in monthly purchases they were already making may not be enough. We think this is just the beginning.”
Right Conditions
“Market sentiment will remain jittery in the near term as the Covid-19 outbreak continues to accelerate in the U.S. and Europe,” said Tai Hui, chief Asia market strategist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Asset Management. “As we have experienced in China and other parts of Asia, the right policies to contain the outbreak should work but this involves some sharp, short term pain. We are likely to go through such pain in the weeks ahead in the U.S. and Europe.”
“For markets to be less anxious, we need to see the number of new infections stabilize, as we did with China (since mid-February) and South Korea (in recent days). We also need to see fiscal and monetary policy support implementation. Hence, we are not looking at specific time or valuation to advise investors to add back equities, but instead we are looking for the right conditions.”
EM Outperformers
“We no longer recommend investors overweight emerging-market equity positions relative to euro-zone stocks” after outperformance by EM in recent days, said Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management. “Equity markets are pessimistic today and volatility is elevated, making downside protection more expensive and access to upside participation relatively cheap. This presents an opportunity for investors looking to maintain exposure to equities, while also managing downside risks, to implement strategies such as put-writing or structured investments, which can offer a degree of capital protection and upside participation.”
Safety Beats Everything
“There’s a whole host of uncertainties out there and markets aren’t sure that the policy measures they have seen so far are coherent, cohesive and coordinated enough to tackle what’s at hand,” said Vishnu Varathan, head of economics and strategy at Mizuho Bank Ltd. “It’s beside the point that we’ve gone into an area where valuations are attractive until the fright stabilizes and is alleviated. It’s difficult for markets to be convinced to be taking the risk in catching falling knives.”
“Everybody just wants to hold perceived safe havens. There’s certainly a flight out of risky assets, which include in the universe emerging-market assets across the equities and FX space, and the flight hasn’t ended.”
Liquidity Constraints
“Despite the recent injections of liquidity from major central banks, they are not flowing into Asia,” said Eugenia Fabon Victorino, head of Asia strategy at Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken in Singapore. “As Asia braces for tighter USD funding, long USD/Asia seems to be the way to go. The dollar index continues to gain ground, re-emerging as the ultimate safe haven. Equity and bond flows into Asia are deeply in the red, with a few Asian equity markets triggering trading halts.”
Recession Pricing
“The fact that we saw gold -- typically a safe haven asset -- decline almost 4% during the session to below $1,600 levels suggested a ‘reach for liquidity’ moment for investors,” said Eli Lee, head of investment strategy at Bank of Singapore. “Investors also expressed their firm preference for the safety of the U.S. dollar yesterday. The USD broadly appreciated against Asian currencies, even against the safe-haven Japanese yen.”
“The equity markets have by now priced in at least a technical recession lasting two quarters, in our view. The larger question is whether we could see a longer fundamental recession.”
Useless Valuations
“The market is in a state where it’s a bit out of control,” said Hiroshi Matsumoto, head of Japan investment at Pictet Asset Management Ltd. “We’ve come to a stage were we can’t predict earnings. Earnings-based valuations have become useless right now. It could be that there’s an overshoot here towards the downside. Honestly, we can’t judge based on these valuations.”
An Optimist’s Take
“The market needs to see clear signs of a peaking of patient count globally, especially in the U.S. and Europe,” said Satoru Matsumoto, a fund manager in Tokyo at Asset Management One Co. “Given the track record in China, I am hoping that we may see some light at the end of the tunnel by early next month.”
“I don’t personally think that this outbreak will slow global growth too much, since it doesn’t stem from a credit crunch per se. But it’s inevitable that economic activities will be hindered given the declines in asset prices. Should oil prices remain low like now, the Indian rupee will be among those that look attractive. Those with higher real rates will have room to ease further and that will spur hopes for further declines in yield. The biggest positive of all is that China is actually starting to show some signs of recovery.”

1419,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 13, 2020 09:35AM ET</span>",Stocks - Wall Street Bounces at Open on Europe Lift: Dow up Over 1000 Points,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com - U.S. stock markets bounced sharply at the opening on Friday as participants took heart from announcements of more emergency support measures out of Europe to cushion the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic.
The bounce also reflected a more sanguine assessment of central bank measures to unblock markets that had shown signs of increasing stress and vanishing liquidity during Thursday’s rout.
By 9:35 AM ET (1335 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 1,317 points, or 6.2%, while the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite were both up 6.0%.
In addition to the Federal Reserve’s announcement of a $1.5 trillion liquidity injection Thursday, the Chinese, Australian, Indonesian, Swedish and Norwegian central banks all announced further measures to stabilize local financial markets on Friday.
They were followed by even more dramatic announcements in Europe, as Germany pledged an unlimited credit facility through its state-owned development bank to companies that suffer cash-flow difficulties as a result of the outbreak. Meanwhile in Brussels, the European Commission signaled that it was ready to suspend its rules on fiscal deficits given the extraordinary circumstances.
In the U.S., House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told reporters late on Thursday that a deal with the Trump administration on a package of economic support measures was “near”. However, President Donald Trump’s Twitter feed indicated that there were still substantial differences between the administration and House Democrats over which measures should be deployed.
“If you want to get money into the hands of people quickly & efficiently, let them have the full money that they earned, APPROVE A PAYROLL TAX CUT until the end of the year, December 31,” Trump said. “Then you are doing something that is really meaningful. Only that will make a big difference!”
Trump had pushed back earlier in the week against Democrat proposals for expanded sick pay and unemployment benefits to be included in the package.
Among individual companies, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock rebounded 6.5% after saying all its stores in China were now open again. In addition, the Financial Times reported that the company had signed a multiyear deal with the world’s three biggest music labels regarding Apple Music’s access to their artists, who include Taylor Swift, Beyonce and Ed Sheeran.
Elsewhere, U.S. crude oil prices rebounded 4.2%, but were off intraday highs after newswires reported Russian energy minister Alexander Novak as downplaying the chance of a new OPEC+ deal to restrain output in the near term."

1473,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 13, 2020 09:11AM ET</span>",Cleaning product makers race to labs to bolster coronavirus claims,"By Siddharth Cavale and Richa Naidu
(Reuters) - As global makers of household cleaners race to pitch their products as coronavirus killers, one major company,  Reckitt Benckiser  (L:RB), may have a leg up on the competition.
The maker of Lysol and Dettol disinfectants said it has already obtained a strain of the novel coronavirus, known as SARS-CoV-2, from an independent lab and plans to use the strain to test whether its products kill the virus.
Watchdogs in the United States and Europe stipulate that a product must be tested in a regulator-approved lab to prove it can be effective against 99.9% of a virus before it can make a virus-killing claim on its label or in ads. In 2012, for instance, when MERS-coronavirus was a major public health concern, cleaning products had to prove they could kill 9,999 out of 10,000 MERS-Coronavirus cells, according to the agencies’ requirement.
COVID-19, the disease caused by novel coronavirus, originated in Wuhan, China, and has spread to more than 100 countries across the world.
The pandemic presents both a challenge and an opportunity for marketers of household brands to show how their products can help consumers deal with a frightening and fast-developing public health crisis. Doing it right could mean added market share; doing it badly will likely have other consequences.
""This coronavirus is the new hype,"" said Michael Reynen, the former research head of Procter & Gamble's (N:PG) surface care business in parts of Europe, the Middle East and Africa.
British consumer goods maker Reckitt told Reuters it procured a sample of the novel coronavirus strain a few days ago and will soon be testing its existing disinfectants for commercial use at a virology lab.
The lab, which Reckitt declined to name, is in the process of duplicating the virus samples to enable sufficient quantities for testing, it said. The lab can test six Reckitt Benckiser products per week, with results of the first batch expected by the end of April, the company said.
Before Reckitt can re-label and stock shelves with its Dettol disinfecting sprays and Lysol toilet cleaners, it must complete a battery of regulator-mandated tests that typically take at least six months. It could take over a year if they need to create entirely new coronavirus-killing products.
Reckitt’s move, which Reuters could not independently verify, could put some of its rivals on the back foot.
At stake are potentially billions of dollars in sales. Consumers spent nearly $22 billion on surface cleaners globally and another $1.43 billion on cleaning wipes in 2019. Clorox has about 4% percent and 37% percent of the surface cleaner and disinfecting wipes categories, respectively, followed by Reckitt, with share of 7.3% and 17.2%.
During public health emergencies, such as 'Bird flu,' the H1N1 pandemic in 2009 and the 2013 MERS crisis, demand for surface cleaners and disinfecting wipes typically spikes, a Reuters analysis of Euromonitor data shows.
'RUSHING AROUND'
Reynen, who held several top research roles in his 24 years at P&G, said companies can spend a few thousand dollars to buy aggressive virus strains like the novel coronavirus from regulator-approved microbiology laboratories, which mail the samples with a glycerin solution in small, deep-frozen vessels.
“Procter and Clorox will be rushing around to get a strain,” he said. “If they don't have it in their labs by now, I'd expect they will in the next week or two.”
P&G, Clorox (N:CLX) and Unilever declined to comment on whether they’re pursuing or have managed to get samples of the novel coronavirus.
The companies likely do not have labs sophisticated enough to complete the rigorous six-month testing for a virus as nasty as this, so they outsource most of the work to external labs approved by regulators, a process that could cost about $100,000-$200,000, Reynen said. The contracted labs typically work with top biomedical research organizations such as the private non-profit Institut Pasteur in Paris and the German government agency Robert Koch-Institut in Berlin.
As deaths and illnesses from the novel coronavirus mount, companies are resorting to the most powerful claims they can make. The U.S. EPA and European Chemicals Agency do allow for certain carefully-worded statements even in the absence of testing against a strain of the novel coronavirus.
For example, Lysol, P&G and Clorox recently created websites promoting awareness, claiming some of their disinfectant products ""demonstrated effectiveness against viruses similar to 2019 Novel Coronavirus"" and ""can be used"" against coronavirus on certain surfaces. P&G also put out a new line of sanitizing products called Microban 24 in late February with TV ads touting they were better than rival Lysol, but the company said the launch was not connected to the coronavirus outbreak.
Retail sales for Lysol wipes and rival Clorox wipes rose 184% in the week ended Feb. 29 versus last year, according to data firm Bloomreach. At the same time, shares of Reckitt, P&G and Clorox have outperformed the broader market, which has plunged since the first case of Coronavirus was detected in China on Dec. 31."

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union's new deal with Brexit Britain envisages a tight trade and security relationship, according to a draft seen by Reuters on Friday, despite London saying it is seeking looser ties.
Britain left the EU in January and is in negotiations with the bloc over a new partnership to take effect after a status-quo transition period runs its course at the end of the year.
The draft, prepared by the bloc's executive Commission before a second round of talks next week, includes a reference to so-called ""level playing field"" provisions to ensure fair competition by keeping rules aligned, which London rejects.
""The Parties recognise that the establishment of conditions that ensure a level playing field between the Parties is necessary for trade and investment,"" the 441-page draft read.
On fisheries, another contentious point between the estranged allies, it envisages reciprocal access to waters. Negotiations would be held each year by Dec. 10 on fishing opportunities for the following year.
In case of trade disruptions, the bloc would be allowed to impose protective measures as soon as 15 days after notifying Britain, it also read.
The draft comes with an accompanying 17 pages of a proposed new partnership on ""foreign policy, security and defence"", which recognizes, however, that ""the United Kingdom has expressed clearly that it does not wish to engage"" in such negotiations.
While the EU is pushing to keep Britain in close touch from 2021, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said he is prepared to default to World Trade Organization rules, which include tariffs and quotas, if London and the bloc are unable to seal a deal.
Johnson also demands that Britain leave the jurisdiction of the EU's top court. The EU draft envisages an arbitration panel to resolve disputes with Britain, but says the panel must be bound by rulings on EU law by the European Court of Justice.
Britain has said it would present its own draft of the future deal before the second round, which is due to start on March 18. Face-to-face talks have now been canceled because of the coronavirus epidemic.
""We are looking at how the discussions can take place using an alternative forum such as video conferencing,"" a spokesman for Johnson said on Friday."

1478,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 13, 2020 08:29AM ET</span>","Outspoken Tesla chief Elon Musk faces $1 billion trial, test of temperament","By Tom Hals and Nichola Groom
WILMINGTON, Del. (Reuters) - Elon Musk is expected to defend a $2.2 billion deal in court next week criticized by shareholders as benefiting Musk at the expense of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc, and the outcome may depend as much on the chief executive's temperament as on the facts of the case. 
The electric vehicle maker's unconventional CEO has shown two sides in recent court proceedings -- one polite and respectful, the other evasive and taunting.
It remains to be seen which Musk will show up on Monday at a Delaware court, the nation's leader on corporate issues, when he squares off against union pension funds and asset managers who claim they were misled about the benefits of Tesla buying SolarCity in 2016 for $2.2 billion. 
Getting it wrong could cost Musk more than $1 billion.
“If you seem arrogant in court, you may be signing your own economic death warrant,"" said John Coffee, a securities professor at Columbia Law School.
This may be particularly true in Delaware's Court of Chancery, with roots in medieval England and known for its decorum.
Musk and his lawyers did not respond to a request for comment. 
Smashing corporate norms has come to define Musk, who has a cult-like following for his ambitious vision, battles with short-sellers and disdain for ""boring bonehead questions"" from analysts.
In the Delaware case, shareholders claim SolarCity, a rooftop solar energy company, was secretly on the brink of bankruptcy when Tesla purchased it. They argue the deal benefited Musk, SolarCity's largest shareholder, his cousins who co-founded the firm, and Tesla directors who owned stakes in SolarCity. 
Investors want Musk to surrender the 2.2 million shares of Tesla he received in the deal, which on Thursday were worth about $1.2 billion.
Musk has countered that Tesla's stock has tripled since the deal, demonstrating its value. SolarCity has withered because its staff were redirected toward launching the Model 3 sedan, a make-or-break product for Tesla, not because the solar business lacked value, according to Musk.
The Tesla directors who approved the deal settled allegations against themselves in January for $60 million, which was paid from insurance. They denied wrongdoing.
Musk has dug in his heels.
During a June deposition, Musk clashed with shareholder lawyer Randy Baron, calling him ""reprehensible,"" doubting his emotional well-being and avoiding many questions.
He went on tangents about Tesla's solar potential, lamented both the decline of U.S. manufacturing and the large size of the legal industry and asked Baron if he was only motivated by money. Baron declined to comment.
In contrast, at a defamation trial in December, Musk donned a dark suit, spoke softly on the witness stand, and apologized to the cave rescuer who sued Musk for calling him a ""pedo guy"" on Twitter. 
Musk portrayed himself as overworked, hounded by critics and earnest in his desire to help in the rescue of 12 boys and their soccer coach from a flooded cave in Thailand.
The strategy appeared to pay off when a jury ruled in Musk's favor and rejected the $190 million claim against him.
The SolarCity case will be decided by Vice Chancellor Joseph Slights.
The court has its own cult-like following for its scholarly opinions that often run more than 100 pages and which have shaped Corporate America.
""The big question is when you get an institution like him and an institution like the Court of Chancery, is it oil and water or is it mutual respect?"" said Larry Hamermesh, a professor at Delaware Law School.
Executives often struggle with testimony because they think of themselves as the smartest in the room, according to University of Pennsylvania Law School Professor Jill Fisch. 
""That works against them in depositions and is even worse in court. It tends to piss off a judge,"" said Fisch. 
David Murdock, the CEO of Dole Food Co Inc, went to Delaware to defend his 2013 buyout of the fruit company, and sunk himself with bizarre, rambling and combative testimony. He was ordered to pay former shareholders $148 million.

""By dint of his prodigious wealth and power, he has grown accustomed to deference,"" wrote the judge, Vice Chancellor Travis Laster, of Murdock. ""That habit serves a witness poorly when he faces a skilled cross-examiner.""

1480,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 13, 2020 07:40AM ET</span>",Texas Shale Heartland Rattled by Coronavirus and Oil Price War,"(Bloomberg) -- Just last week, when Crude Oil prices fell to $46 a barrel, the mayor of the biggest city in the world’s largest shale oil patch seemed oddly calm, almost relieved.
Midland, in the heart of the Permian Basin in Texas, could use something of a slowdown, Patrick Payton figured, after breakneck growth had stretched services so thin that the police force could barely keep cops on the beat. Then a couple days passed, and the digital sign downtown that flashes the current oil price read -- suddenly -- $30. Payton could hardly take it in.
“Crisis is an overused word, but it’s a crisis of shock,” he said. “We have to adjust to our new reality.”
Texas as a whole might have to. While Midland represents a hyper-concentrated microcosm of the state’s dependence on oil, the economy still rides the tide of the industry even after decades of broad diversification.
In good times, it has helped the state grow far faster than most in the U.S., while in bad times it has weighed on growth. The oil war between Russia and Saudi Arabia that sent prices crashing is a threat. Factor in the coronavirus, which sparked a markets rout and is throttling global oil demand, and the picture gets bleaker.
The Dallas bank Comerica (NYSE:CMA) Inc. may further downgrade its 2020 economic growth forecast for Texas to 2%, after last month projecting it would slow to 3.1% from last year’s 4.4%. While 2% isn’t exactly lousy, and better than what’s expected for the U.S. as a whole, it would be a comedown for the Lone Star State.
“This could be dicey,” said Jason Schenker, president of Austin-based Prestige Economics LLC. “Right now, there are bumps in the road. We could see more than bumps -- potholes.”
The No. 1 crude producer in the country, Texas boasts more energy-company headquarters than anywhere else on the planet. Between 1997 and 2017, the business of oil and gas extraction made up 3% to 12% of the state’s GDP each year. But there’s also been a consistent uptick in jobs added in a range of other fields, including health care and finance.
“The non-energy part of the Texas economy has been growing so strongly,” said Robert Dye, Comerica’s chief economist. “That is a major stabilizing force.”
Will it be enough?
It’s a political question too, because a strong economy in Texas would benefit President Donald Trump while weakness could help his Democratic opponent in November.
Republicans are already facing headwinds there. Changing demographics -- boosted by an influx of young professionals -- make the state competitive after a generation of GOP dominance.
Trump won Texas by 9 percentage points in 2016 but now leads former Vice President Joe Biden, the likely Democratic nominee, by less than 3 percentage points, according to a RealClearPolitics average of polls.
In the Permian Basin in West Texas -- where half of all U.S. oilfield work occurs -- spending by producers is expected to drop 40% by year-end, according to Coras Research. Across the U.S., between 1,500 and 3,000 oilfield service jobs will be affected in the next two months, according to Matt Johnson, chief executive of Primary Vision, which tracks industry data.
Companies had already started to rein in activity last year, driven by Wall Street demands to cut debt and return more profits to shareholders. Several have instituted hiring freezes, said Sam Cross, a senior vice president for Airswift, a recruiter. Layoffs haven’t begun but “among staff and candidates, there’s a lot of fear.”
When oil’s fetching less than $35 a barrel, drilling new wells is a money-losing game for almost every U.S. shale producer. Diamondback Energy Inc., one of the biggest independent producers, announced it was dropping rigs on Monday morning. More than a dozen companies have since followed suit.
“It’s going to hurt us big time,” said Alexis Cervantes, a truck driver who hauls water to and from frack sites. An El Paso native, he moved to Pecos, almost 100 miles southwest of Midland, because wages are so much higher in the basin, even with the recent slowdown in activity. “I’d much rather stay.”
Job losses and bankruptcies seem inevitable, in the Permian oilfields and beyond. State data released this month show Midland’s sales tax revenue plunged 20% from the year before.
“It’s scary but I’m trying to stay positive,” said César Lozano, who started Papa Tacho’s in Midland after the last downturn in 2016. He’s opening a second location of the Mexican restaurant, which is packed with workers sporting steel-toed boots and oilfield logos during lunchtime.
“You can’t have your ups without your downs,” he said. “People here are resilient. We’ll find a way.”
Across the region, local banks with the highest oil and gas exposure are also facing a tough test. Shares of BOK Financial Corporation (NASDAQ:BOKF),   Bank7   Corp (NASDAQ:BSVN)., and Cadence Bancorp (NYSE:CADE) have all plunged this week, amid a market-wide sell off. While the largest U.S. lenders have much bigger energy-related loan books, that debt represents a smaller overall share for them.
As the state’s population has grown, so have leisure and hospitality jobs. Back in the 2015-2016 oil crash, the sector continued to add jobs even as thousands were laid off in energy. As large events like Austin’s South by Southwest are canceled and Americans curb their travel because of the coronavirus, hospitality jobs are likely some of the most at risk.
Another concern is the state’s health-care system. Texas had the nation’s highest share of residents without health insurance in 2018, at 17.7%. People without coverage may think twice before going to the doctor for testing, which could contribute to the spread of the virus.
That all puts Texas in a precarious position at an uncertain time for the broader U.S. economy. If America falls into a recession, Texas could rank among the hardest hit states, said Adam Kamins, an economist at Moody’s Analytics.
“You couple this with a broader demand shock, and even secondary drivers will be hit hard, like different types of office jobs, manufacturing,” Kamins said. “This looks like a black swan event -- a one-time shock or multiple shocks at once that could drive the economy into recession.”"

1483,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 13, 2020 05:56AM ET</span>",EU to give states spending leeway to tackle virus fallout on economy,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Commission is set to formally announce on Friday measures that would let EU governments spend more freely to prop up economic sectors battered by the coronavirus crisis, officials said.
The move would give a green light to deficit spending already announced by Italy, the European Union country worst hit so far by the outbreak.
It would also offer states traditionally reticent to spend, like Germany, a new argument to unlock financial resources in what could be a coordinated fiscal boost at EU level.
Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and the vice-president for economic affairs, Valdis Dombrovskis, are set to unveil the widely anticipated measures at a news conference at 1 p.m. (1200 GMT).
Following an emergency video-conference with EU leaders on Tuesday, von der Leyen has already announced some of the key proposals, which include the use of existing EU funds to help ailing sectors and more flexibility on fiscal rules and state aid regulations for governments.
Von der Leyen is also expected to propose a plan to provide cheap loans to firms at risk of collapse because of the coronavirus crisis.
Under EU fiscal rules, the bloc's governments are required to keep their budget deficit below 3% of gross domestic product (GDP) and have to reduce their debt if it is above 60% of GDP.
The rules already allow states to spend more in emergency circumstances. The commission is expected to restate this principle, clearly saying the coronavirus outbreak warrants exceptional spending.
EU state aid rules limit governments to pour public money into failing companies, but they also allow emergency support under certain circumstances.
The commission is set to confirm that these subsidy rules will be temporarily relaxed to fight the downturn caused by the virus, after EU antitrust commission Margrethe Vestager said on Tuesday that Brussels was open to compensation for ailing firms.
During the 2008/09 global financial crisis, a similar softening of fiscal and state subsidy rules allowed governments to spend hundreds of billions of euros to bail out banks and revive the economy.
For these measures to be effective it is however crucial that governments with larger financial power, like Germany, are willing to spend more and in a coordinated fashion."

LONDON (Reuters) - World stocks were set on Friday for their worst week since the 2008 financial crisis, with coronavirus panic-selling hitting nearly every asset class and investors fretting that central bank action may not be enough to soothe the pain.
European stock markets were slightly higher on Friday on hopes governments will step up spending, but only after several sessions of sustained, heavy losses as investors faced the possibility of a global recession that could be prolonged.
Warning signs still flashed, with Italian government bonds tanking again on Friday morning, after suffering their worst day in nine years in the previous session.
Italy and Spain meanwhile imposed trading curbs, banning short-selling of dozens of stocks, to stem a market rout triggered by the coronavirus outbreak that saw European stock exchanges post their worst-ever losses on Thursday.
The MSCI world equity index (MIWD00000PUS), which tracks shares in 49 countries, hit a three-year low in Asian hours and is down 16% this week so far -- its worst run since October 2008 when Lehman Brothers' collapse triggered the global crisis.
""Markets are quite prepared for a period of falling output. The real fear is that you get second-round effects that result in a nastier, longer recession in the global economy,"" said Investec economist Philip Shaw.
""That is going to be very difficult to escape from given the monetary pedal is very close to the floor in many jurisdictions.""
MSCI's main European Index was up 2.7% at the open, after having fallen more than 20% over the past week.
Earlier, Japan's Nikkei (N225) fell 10% before paring losses to close 6% lower. Australia's S&P/ASX200 (AXJO) had its wildest trading day on record, falling past 8% before surging in the last minutes of trade to settle 4.4% higher at the close.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan (MIAPJ0000PUS) wobbled 0.1% higher by late afternoon after falling more than 5% in morning trade.
The slight recovery came as central banks from the United States to Australia pumped liquidity into their financial systems and as hopes grew that U.S. Democrats and Republicans could pass a stimulus package on Friday.
ITALIAN PAIN
There was no such recovery in Italian government bonds, with the benchmark 10-year yield -- which moves inversely to price -- rising another 16 basis points in early trade. (IT10YT=RR)
The yield had leapt by 55 bps on Thursday -- its worst day since November 2011, near the peak of the euro zone debt crisis -- after the European Central Bank kept rates steady and put the onus firmly on governments, sending markets into a tailspin.
Italy is one of the worst-hit countries in Europe from the spread of coronavirus, with the death toll shooting past 1,000 people and the government ordering blanket closures of restaurants, bars and almost all shops.

The Spanish ban will affect 69 stocks, including all liquid stocks that fell more than 10% Thursday and all illiquid stocks that fell more than 20%, while in Italy 85 stocks will be affected by the ban.
Short selling in some Italian and Spanish securities will also be banned in all U.K. trading venues for the day, the U.K.’s Financial Conduct Authority said in a statement. A spokesman for the FCA declined to comment on whether the regulator would consider a ban on short sales of U.K. stocks.
Italy’s FTSE MIB plunged 17% on Thursday, while Spain’s IBEX 35 slumped 14%, both record losses, amid a global sell-off as measures announced by the European Central Bank and the U.S. to combat the economic effects of the coronavirus disappointed. Both benchmarks rose at least 3.3% as of 9:33 a.m. in Milan on Friday.
UniCredit SpA (MI:CRDI), Telecom Italia SPA (NYSE:TI),   Banco Santander   (MC:SAN) and   Telefonica   (MC:TEF) are among the companies that will be protected by the short-selling ban.
In Germany, short selling of stocks will not be banned for now, a spokesman for the Deutsche Boerse (DE:DB1Gn) said. The country’s benchmark index plunged 12% on Thursday. Switzerland’s SIX Exchange isn’t planning a ban as its market is functioning while Dutch market regulator AFM said it is monitoring the situation.
Short-selling restrictions were also put in place for some Asian markets, with South Korea’s Financial Services Commission going the furthest by banning short-selling of shares listed on Kospi, Kosdaq and Konex for six months. In Thailand, short sales were not banned, but rules are being adjusted for current market conditions, according to the President of the country’s stock exchange."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Banks have hundreds of billions of dollars in credit lines extended to corporate America. Some companies are no longer banking on them.
Airplane maker  Boeing Co  (N:BA), hotel operator  Hilton Worldwide  Holdings Inc (N:HLT) and theme park company SeaWorld Entertainment Inc (N:SEAS) are among the companies that drew on or upsized their credit lines this week, as the market rout triggered by the coronavirus pandemic fueled fears about a potential liquidity crunch.
Hilton said in a regulatory filing on Wednesday that it had drawn on $195 million left untapped in its $1.75 billion revolving credit facility ""to increase its cash position and preserve financial flexibility in light of current uncertainty in the global markets resulting from the COVID-19 (coronavirus) outbreak.""
The other two companies did not name the coronavirus as a reason for lining up more credit, and did not respond when asked by Reuters whether the outbreak influenced their considerations.
However, investment bankers and corporate finance professionals said many companies are driven by fears that the banks may not fund agreed credit lines should the market turmoil intensify, either because they will not be able to meet demand or because they may seek a reason in the credit agreements and covenants not to.
""That is the concern. The uncertainty is forcing companies to draw down the revolvers now,"" said Ryan Maupin, principal at accounting firm Grant Thornton.
Bank of America Corp (N:BAC),  Citigroup  (N:C), JPMorgan Chase (N:JPM) and  Wells Fargo  (N:WFC) are some of the biggest providers of credit lines to companies. They declined to comment.
No industrywide data on the utilization of credit lines is available. So far, drawdowns have largely come from companies in the sectors hit hardest by the coronavirus outbreak, such as hospitality, energy and travel, analysts and bankers said.
The U.S. banking sector is capitalized at its strongest levels since the 2008 financial crisis, according to credit rating service S&P Global. Banks are required by regulators to keep enough high-quality liquid assets to cover projected cash outflows for 30 days in a short-term stress scenario. They also have other access to cash, such as from the Federal Reserve and the Federal Home Loan Bank system.
Yet this has not been enough to reassure many of their borrowers and industry analysts.
""A flood of corporate drawdowns could force the entire banking system into becoming a deficit agent,""  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) research analyst Zoltan Pozsar wrote in a note earlier this month."

Investing.com -- European stock markets opened with a bounce on Friday after fear of the coronavirus outbreak triggered their worst one-day fall in over 30 years on Thursday. 
By 4:10 AM ET (0810 GMT), the benchmark Euro Stoxx 600 was up 8.1 points, or 2.7% at 304.62. However, that's a relatively insignificant move after a drop of over 10% on Thursday that left it down over 17% for the week.
The U.K. FTSE 100 was 6.9% while the German DAX was up 3.8% and the Italian FTSE MIB was up 6.0%. 
Some markets were supported by reports of regulators imposing short-selling bans, as well as by the intervention of the Federal Reserve on Thursday, which came after the market close. The Fed had set out plans to inject $1.5 trillion into markets to restore liquidity, while also signaling what analysts dubbed the start of a new wave of quantitative easing.
However, markets are struggling to recover from two badly misjudged interventions from leading policy makers over the last 48 hours. President Donald Trump's failure to address U.S. diagnostic shortcomings, and ECB President Christine Lagarde's insouciant remarks about the rising risk premiums on Italian government bonds, both shook confidence in the ability of economic policy to turn the current situation around. 
“The adverse market reaction may not be just a market verdict on the ECB’s package,” said Berenberg’s Schmieding in a note to clients on Thursday. “It may reflect a growing realization that monetary and fiscal policy cannot be the genuine circuit-breakers in a medical emergency.”

SYDNEY/CHICAGO (Reuters) - The fallout from the coronavirus spread across the Pacific on Friday, with Australian travel firms issuing profit warnings and Japanese carriers cutting capacity, while U.S. airlines rushed to cut flights to Europe in the wake of new travel restrictions.
U.S. travel curbs on much of continental Europe announced by President Donald Trump on Wednesday deepened the sector's misery that began after the virus emerged in China late last year and reduced traffic. 
United Airlines Holdings Inc (O:UAL) warned of U.S. travel disruption as the virus spreads domestically and major tourist attractions like Walt  Disney  Co's (N:DIS) theme parks in California and Florida said they would close.
 American Airlines Group  Inc (O:AAL) and United said they would continue normal flights to and from Europe for the next week but would be reducing capacity to Europe by around 50% in April. 
American also said it was cutting international capacity by 34% for the summer travel season and accelerating the retirement of its  Boeing Co  (N:BA) 757 and 767 planes. 
Delta Air Lines Inc (N:DAL) also said it would significantly reduce its U.S.-Europe schedule after Sunday as it continues to watch customer demand.
German airport operator  Fraport  (DE:FRAG) said on Friday that passenger numbers at its key Frankfurt airport dropped by around 30% in the first week of March due to the coronavirus epidemic.
""We have to assume that the strong decline in air traffic volumes will continue during the next few weeks and months,"" CEO Stefan Schulte said in a statement.
Air France KLM SA (PA:AIRF) said on Friday that it had drawn down on 1.1 billion euros ($1.2 billion) worth of its revolving credit facility to help its financial position.
The International Air Transport Association (IATA), a global industry group representing airlines, called on governments to consider extending lines of credit, reducing infrastructure costs and cutting taxes. 
IATA last week estimated that the crisis could wipe out some $113 billion of industry revenue, in a forecast that did not include the U.S. clampdown on European travel. 
""There is a heightened concern there will be increased airline bankruptcies in 2020 given the fallout from the coronavirus,"" Cowen analyst Helane Becker said.
""We expect some governments to step in to help some airlines, but ultimately we expect more airlines to fail this year than last year,"" she said in a note to clients, citing Cirium data that 41 airlines with 324 aircraft went bankrupt last year. 
Cash-strapped low-cost carrier  Norwegian Air Shuttle ASA  (OL:NWC) said on Thursday it would cut 4,000 flights and temporarily lay off up to half of its employees due to the coronavirus outbreak.
The Indian government said it would extend the deadline for submission of early bids for ailing state carrier Air India until April 30 in part due to the virus situation.

 Virgin Australia  Holdings Ltd (AX:VAH), Auckland International Airport Ltd (NZ:AIA),  Flight Centre  Travel Group Ltd (AX:FLT) and Corporate Travel Management Ltd (AX:CTD) said they would take hits to earnings from reduced travel demand. 
Australia's No. 2 carrier, Virgin Australia, said it would offer discounted fares and cut some flights from Sydney to Los Angeles as demand for trans-Pacific travel fell.
""You will see us continue to be very disciplined with capacity as the situation evolves,"" Virgin Australia Chief Executive Paul Scurrah told reporters, echoing similar comments by rival Qantas Airways Ltd (AX:QAN) earlier in the week. 
Virgin and Flight Centre joined a growing list of travel companies, which includes the big U.S. airlines, that are freezing hiring, halting executive bonuses and offering unpaid leave.
Singapore will deny from Monday entry or transit to visitors who have been in Italy, France, Spain or Germany in the last 14 days, the health ministry said on Friday.
Earlier in the day, Singapore Changi Airport announced seat capacity for the month of March was down nearly 30% from what was originally scheduled.
CGS-CIMB analyst Raymond Yap said the global spread of the virus meant the fall in demand for Singapore Airlines Ltd (SI:SIAL) regional flights was likely to spread to long-haul flights, hurting the take-up rate in the lucrative business and first-class cabins.
Japan's ANA Holdings Inc (T:9202) and  Japan Airlines Co Ltd  (JAL) (T:9201) closed 7.6% and 13% lower respectively.
JAL said it would cut 1,468 domestic flights between March 20 and March 28 stemming from lower demand because sporting and cultural events had been suspended in Japan.

ANA will cut the number of daily flights from Japan to Los Angeles and New York and reduce operations to other cities in North America from Monday, it said. It also said there will be fewer flights to Europe including France, Germany and Belgium.

The Shenzhen-based automaker, which is backed by U.S. investor Warren Buffett, said in a statement it started work on building a new mask production line in late January. BYD also produces around 300,000 bottles of hand sanitizers a day, it said.
BYD, which also produces EV batteries, said it will give masks to its workers to ensure normal production and will supply the rest to people in Hubei, the epicenter of the coronavirus, and to hospitals and public transport.

Still, most benchmarks remained deeply in the red, with investors spooked that emergency fiscal and monetary packages won’t be enough to stave off a recession.
S&P 500 contracts reversed losses of as much as 3% to trade little changed, while futures in the U.K. ticked higher. Losses in Japan and South Korea eased. Global equities are still heading for their worst week since 2008 as investors price in a severely weaker outlook due to the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. The U.S. benchmark lost 9.5% on Thursday. The won and rupiah sank while India’s rupee fell to a record low versus the dollar. Bonds in Australia and Japan declined, as investors rushed to raise cash. Treasury yields fluctuated.
“Markets remain in a free-fall as uncertainty persists with no reliable anchor which can create near-term stability,” said Ben Emons, managing director of global macro strategy at Medley Global Advisors in New York.
Investors are doubting the efficacy of policy responses as coronavirus cases continue to grow across the world and restrictions on people and businesses crush sentiment. The Bank of Japan on Friday followed an earlier move from the Federal Reserve to inject liquidity, and later offered to buy $1.9 billion of bonds in an unscheduled operation. The Bank of Korea said it is closely monitoring bond markets and will take action if it deems it needed and Indonesia announced a second fiscal stimulus package of $1.55 billion, while the European Central Bank eased capital constraints and boosted liquidity on Thursday.

Investing.com - Softbank Group Corp. (T:9984) said on Friday that it is set to buy back as much as 7% of its shares for up to 500 billion yen ($4.8 billion). 
The re-purchase will start next week and run though March 15, 2021. 
The move was advocated by activist investor Elliott Management, which argued SoftBank’s shares were “substantially undervalued.” Earlier this year, Elliott also urged the Japanese firm to be more transparent about its investments and make changes to its corporate governance. 
Founder and CEO of SoftBank Masayoshi Son also said SoftBank’s shares may be worth more than double the current prices. 
SoftBank announced a record buyback in early 2019, which sent the stocks to its highest level since 2000. The gains were wiped out later in the year over a disappointing public debut of Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) and the implosion of WeWork. 
The news failed to lift SoftBank’s shares, as it plunged as much as 9.2% today alongside with the broad market decline. "

The S&P BSE Sensex tumbled 9.4% to 29,687.52 within minutes after trading began on Friday, while the NSE Nifty 50 Index sank 10% setting off a market-wide circuit breaker that halted trading for 45 minutes. It is India’s first such suspension since May 2009. The rupee fell 0.4% to 74.50 per dollar, an all-time low.
“There’s a global re-pricing of risk and India’s getting swept up in that wave,” said Rainer Michael Preiss, equity chief investment officer at the Global CIO Office in Singapore.
Stocks tumbled across Asia after the worst Wall Street session since 1987, with investors spooked that emergency fiscal and monetary packages won’t be enough to stave off a recession. The slide triggered trading halts in Thailand, Indonesia and South Korea. Indian equities entered a bear market on Thursday as foreigners pulled $2.7 billion from the country’s equities this month.
The slump in stocks and the currency threatens to hurt the nation’s already fragile economy that’s expanding at the slowest pace in 11 years. The Reserve Bank of India’s efforts to calm the market by announcing $2 billion of the FX swaps on Thursday weren’t enough to soothe sentiments. The rupee is down 3.1% this month, the second-worst performer in Asia.
“Past lows are not a line in the sand,” and there is a risk of the rupee hitting 78 and then 80, said Vishnu Varathan, head of economics and strategy at Mizuho Bank Ltd. in Singapore. Such a big sell-off “will ignite major concerns because of the ability of such moves to exacerbate capital outflows.”
RBI said in a statement on Thursday that it is closely monitoring the global situation and “stands ready to take all necessary measures” to ensure the normal functioning of financial markets. The Indian currency has come under tremendous pressure as foreign investors unloaded $1.2 billion worth of local bonds in March so far on top of their sales of shares, data compiled by Bloomberg shows.

The package announced Friday, which includes a raft of tax breaks, would contribute to a widening of the budget deficit to 2.5% of gross domestic product, compared to an initial target of 1.76%, Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati said. “These won’t be the last measures,” she said.
The new package, which follows $745 million in stimulus announced last month, comes amid a deteriorating outlook for Indonesia’s economy. Despite only 34 confirmed cases of Covid-19 so far, the country has been hit hard by the risk aversion sweeping global markets, with Indonesia’s stock index now in bear territory and the currency down more than 7% in the past month.

1502,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 13, 2020 12:44AM ET</span>","Exclusive: U.S. shale urges service firms offer 'at least' 25% price cuts - executives, letter","(This March 12 story corrects typographical error in the third paragraph, and spelling of Parsley in the fourth and seventh paragraphs. The errors also occurred in a previous version of this story.)
By Arathy S Nair and Liz Hampton
BENGALURU/DENVER (Reuters) - U.S. shale producers are seeking sharp service costs cuts to deal with plummeting prices and shrinking demand, according to executives and a letter sent to top providers, driving home the oil industry's desperate efforts to cope with a market dive.
Oil companies that recently delivered 2020 spending plans based on $55 to $65 a barrel oil were confronted on Monday with sub-$35 prices after OPEC launched a price war amid slack demand from the ravages of coronavirus on the global economy.
Prices have plummeted so rapidly and to such an extent that shale producers that have not pre-sold their output at higher prices will soon be unprofitable, said analysts.
In a letter sent on Wednesday to oilfield equipment and service providers,  Parsley Energy  (N:PE) operating chief David Dell-Osso asked them ""to reconsider your pricing"" and help the company achieve an ""at least 25%"" reduction in its costs. 
This week's oil market crash, brought on by weakening demand from coronavirus and a price war triggered by Saudi Arabia and other big producers pumping full bore, are behind the urgent plea, Dell-Osso said. 
Parsley did not respond to a request for comment. 
Parsley on Monday was among the first oil companies to disclose a big reduction in spending plans, saying it will halt a fifth of its 15 drilling rigs by April.
Oilfield services executives expressed displeasure with the requests, saying many companies are barely profitable at current service rates. 
""Anyone dumb enough to ask for discount today is a (expletive),"" said a drilling executive who did not want to be identified.
But several oil producers have been asking for 25% price cuts and have won concessions, said James West, a senior managing director at investment bank Evercore ISI. 
West, who has urged consolidation to wring out costs, said oilfield firms would be better off rejecting contracts that are not profitable. Pricing is low, and a 25% cut may not deliver much relief, he added.
""We had already given price concessions to protect market share, so we're running close to break even in North America before the oil price crash,"" Ian Bryant, chief executive of services provider Packers Plus Energy Services Inc, said earlier this week. 
Some oilfield firms have moved to lower their own costs. At Liberty Oilfield Services (N:LBRT), which provides well completion services, executives agreed to take a 20% pay cut. 
Oilfield service firms ""have been subsidizing E&Ps for the past few years, and were just getting by,"" said Robert Callaway, CEO of Range Valuation Services. ""There are going to be a lot of companies that have a hard time surviving.""

SEOUL (Reuters) - Days after photographs of broken windows and smashed china hit the newsstands revealing a Christmas Day family squabble in the home of Korean Air's late patriarch, an activist fund received an unsolicited offer to help unseat the current chairman. 
Heather Cho, eldest daughter of the founding family's late patriarch, made the proposal to Korea Corporate Governance Improvement (KCGI), the biggest shareholder of Korean Air's (KS:003490) parent Hanjin Kal (KS:180640), to oust her younger brother, Walter.
""I didn't meet her initially because I didn't take it seriously when she said she was ready to give up everything,"" Kang Sung-boo, who runs the $380-million fund that is pushing for board and management overhaul at the airline, told Reuters.
""I didn't trust her until she agreed to take her hands off management."" 
Heather Cho's legal counsel did not comment on Kang's recount of their discussions.
Walter Cho was not available for comment.
Hanjin said Cho, in light of ""his clear vision, managing capability and global network,"" was better suited for longer-term investment than professional managers. 
Heather Cho is known for the 'nut rage' incident in 2014, after she forced a Korean Air plane to return to the gate because she did not like the way she was served nuts.
A win by the 47-year-old activist investor will be a watershed moment in South Korea's 67-year post-war corporate history which has been led by family-owned chaebol and spawned global industrial powerhouses such as Samsung (KS:005930) and Hyundai.
It will make Korean Air the first top chaebol group to shake off the grip of its founding family, as many conglomerates transition to the third generation of their founding fathers.
Kang's fund, KCGI, and his backers, including Heather, have mustered roughly 37% of the voting rights of Hanjin and seek to replace Walter Cho with mobile industry veteran Kim Shin-bae as a new board member to press restructuring of Korean Air. 
Walter Cho, seen backed by other family members and Delta Air Lines Inc (N:DAL), commands about 40% of the voting rights. 
The proxy fight would also be a major distraction for the loss-making airline which warned this month that the virus outbreak could threaten its survival, after it scrapped more than 80% of its capacity and ordered cabin crew on leave. 
TURNING POINT
With limited success in South Korea for activist shareholder campaigns by the likes of Elliott, Kang did not initially think of replacing Walter Cho, whose family, including Heather, controls about 33% of Hanjin. 
""We were simply hoping to prod Korean Air to cut debt and stop investing in unprofitable businesses,"" he said, adding that his proposed restructuring offers the carrier huge upside potential, given its solid core earnings power. 
The homegrown activist fund took a stake of just 9% in Hanjin in 2018, enough to ruffle its feathers. 
""They refused twice to meet us, effectively saying we were just one of ten thousand shareholders with whom they can't meet individually. That really disappointed me.""
Hanjin said many activist funds seemingly advocating shareholder rights ended up taking profit, and private funds' threats to management do not help long-term development. 
Events, however, took a dramatic turn after the family patriarch died last April, sparking a feud among the siblings over how best to manage the group that escalated into a proxy battle. 
""My campaign will be a catalyst for a more transparent and fair governance system. This is a good signal for foreign investors,"" he said, adding poor corporate governance has kept Korean stocks trading at a sharp discount. 
Investor scrutiny of Korea's family groups has grown since a 2017 corruption scandal involving South Korea's ex-president and Samsung chief and as succession looms for the third generation of founding families. 
""The third generation is taking over, but their abilities aren't proven, so the process of finding the most suitable CEO has become more transparent,"" said Lee Chang-min, a Hanyang University management professor, calling the proxy fight ""a turning point."" 
Kang said Walter, Hanjin CEO since 2014 and Korean Air CEO since 2016, should take responsibility for the airline's debt-to-equity ratio of more than 800% - one of the highest among airlines - which he blamed on decisions such as a takeover of doomed Hanjin Shipping in 2014 and aggressive fleet expansion. 
""Both the brother and sister are not good managers,"" he said. Heather was briefly jailed in 2015 over the nut rage incident. 
FIRST SUCCESS CASE?
Family-controlled conglomerates often lack checks by outside board directors, who ""may just say yes to the family,"" said Jamie Allen, secretary-general of the Asian Corporate Governance Association. 
""This is why we're interested in the work being done by KCGI, because it's been pushing for board improvements."" 
But the fate of Kang's bid remains uncertain, as both sides compete to build up stakes and doubts persist over the viability of the overhaul. 
One of Korean Air's employee unions said professional managers proposed by KCGI were no more than ""ceremonial figures"", and criticized Heather for joining hands with a speculative fund.
""It is like sleeping with the enemy. They have formed an alliance against a common foe,"" said Park Sang-in, a professor and chaebol reformist. ""(Heather) Cho is very unpopular, and she is a stumbling block to winning votes.""
Kang, who earned a business degree from the prestigious Seoul National University and wrote books on corporate governance, started KCGI in 2017 with some investors who had been rewarded by his successful exit from mid-sized builder Yonjin Construction & Engineering. 
Kang said KCGI wants to boost long-term corporate value and reiterated there would be no workforce restructuring if he won the battle, which he acknowledged would be uphill. 

""It is a miracle that we have come this far, given the situation in the Republic of Korea.""

Investing.com - It was a dismal end to the week for Asian markets, which took more hard hits after US markets tumbled in their worst session since the 1987 “Black Monday” crash.
With details still scarce on a stimulus package proposed by U.S. President Donald Trump and despite the announcement of a US$1.5 trillion injection from the U.S. Federal Reserve, U.S. markets fell almost into the double digits. The  Dow Jones Industrial Average  closed down 9.99%, the S&P 500  fell 9.51% and the NASDAQ Composite  lost 9.43%.
In Asia, Japan’s  Nikkei 225 tumbled 9.84% shortly into the morning session and South Korea’s  KOSPI  was down 8.14% by 9:44 PM ET (1:44 AM GMT). The plunge triggered circuit breakers in both markets soon after they opened. Australia’s ASX 200 tumbled 7.61%.
Hong Kong’s  Hang Seng Index  lost 7.39%. China’s Shanghai Composite  was down 3.37% and the Shenzhen Component was down by 2.31%.
The Fed announced the $1.5 trillion injection into the financial system on Thursday. This will incorporate purchases including bills, notes, Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities and other instruments. It will also begin purchasing coupon-bearing securities until April 13.
The move did not impress Whalen Global Advisors founder Christopher Whalen, who told CNBC the “virus [COVID-19] was the catalyst but it’s not the cause.”
“Both bonds and equities were inflated rather dramatically by our friends at the Fed. You’re seeing the end game for monetary policy here, which is at a certain point you have to stop. Otherwise you get grotesque asset bubbles like we saw, and the engine just runs out of fuel.”
“Markets remain in a free-fall as uncertainty persists without a reliable anchor which can create near-term stability,” Ben Emons, managing director of global macro strategy at Medley Global Advisors, told Bloomberg.

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Walt  Disney  Co (N:DIS) will close its theme parks in California and Florida and its resort in Paris from this weekend through the end of the month due to the global outbreak of coronavirus, the company said on Thursday. 
Disney Cruise Line will suspend all new departures starting Saturday through the end of the month, the company said.
""We are proceeding with the closure of our theme parks at Walt Disney World Resort in Florida and Disneyland Paris Resort, beginning at the close of business on Sunday, March 15, through the end of the month,"" the company said in a statement.
Disney earlier had said that its Disneyland and California Adventure theme parks in Southern (NYSE:SO) California would be closed from Saturday.
The hotels at both Walt Disney World and Disneyland Paris will remain open until further notice, the company added.
The company's theme parks in Hong Kong, Shanghai and Tokyo remain closed after being shuttered earlier this year in response to the coronavirus outbreak, which started in China.
Disney's stock ended down 13%, on a day when Wall Streets major indexes all slumped about 10%.
No cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, have been reported at the parks in Anaheim, California, a company representative said in a statement. The announcement coincided with statewide restrictions on public gatherings ordered by California Governor Gavin Newsom.
Comcast Corp's (O:CMCSA) Universal Studios theme park near Los Angeles also will close on Saturday with plans to reopen on March 28, the company said.
Newsom ordered a statewide ban on most non-essential gatherings of more than 250 people, including sporting events, business conferences and concerts, but his directive exempted casinos and theaters, as well as theme and amusement parks. 
Disney said it decided to voluntarily close its Southern California parks ""in the best interest of our guests and employees"" after reviewing Newsom's directive.
As of Thursday, 198 coronavirus cases have been documented in California, including four deaths, Newsom said. 
California is one of a handful of states, along with New York, that have adopted such drastic ""social distancing"" measures, designed to limit transmission of the highly contagious respiratory virus by curtailing close contacts among people. Ohio and Maryland have ordered statewide closures of public schools. 
Disney-run hotels in Anaheim will remain open through Monday to give guests time to make travel arrangements, the company said. Disney will pay its employees during the shutdown and refund payments for hotel bookings, it added.
Located about 30 miles (48 km) south of Los Angeles, the two Disney parks drew 28.6 million visitors in 2018, according to the Themed Entertainment Association. 
Disneyland, which opened in 1955, is nicknamed the ""Happiest Place on Earth."" The adjacent California Adventure park was added in 2001.
After Disney's announcement, S&P revised Disney’s credit outlook to negative from stable, citing event cancellations and travel restrictions due to coronavirus.
""The negative outlook on Disney reflects the increased uncertainty around the extent of the impact of the coronavirus crisis on the global economy,” S&P said.
It is unusual for Disney to close its theme parks. Brief shutdowns have occurred due to hurricanes and following the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks in the United States.
The company estimated in February that the shutdowns of Shanghai Disney Resort and Hong Kong Disneyland alone would cost $175 million if both remained closed for two months.

1507,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 12, 2020 08:00PM ET</span>",Ford takes aim at Jeep with new Bronco SUVs,"By Paul Lienert
DETROIT (Reuters) - Nearly 55 years after the debut of the original Ford Bronco — and 24 years after the demise of the last one —  Ford Motor Co . (N:F) is dusting off one of its treasured nameplates this spring in hopes of reviving a decades-old rivalry with  Fiat  Chrysler Automobile’s (MI:FCHA) popular Jeep brand.
Leading the charge is a trim new mid-size Bronco sport utility vehicle, based on the Ranger pickup. Ford insiders have hinted there are more Bronco models to follow, including a smaller, car-based Bronco Sport later this year, with rumors of a Bronco pickup and a high-performance Bronco Raptor said to be under consideration.
The automaker is slated to reveal details of the 2021 Bronco on March 17.
Since announcing the return of the Bronco three years ago, Ford executives have made it clear the latest edition is targeted at the long-lived Jeep Wrangler. The rivalry dates back to mid-1965, when the original Bronco was launched as a compact two-door SUV, aimed squarely at the Jeep CJ, the predecessor of the Wrangler.
But Ford does not intend to stop there. It sees the potential to build a franchise around the Bronco name, a feat accomplished by Jeep over a period of eight decades, though under at least six owners.
Beau Boeckmann, president of Galpin Ford in the Los Angeles area and one of the largest U.S. Ford dealers, said the return of the Bronco is the most exciting vehicle launch he has seen from Ford in a long time.
""I've had more people ask about this car than anything else we've launched,"" he said. ""I don't see why Bronco's potential wouldn't be the same as Jeep's.""
The Jeep family now includes six nameplates in North America, from the tiny Renegade to the new Gladiator pickup, with several additional models sold overseas and more coming.
The Jeep brand generates a huge share of Fiat Chrysler’s profit, analysts say. So much so that  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analyst Adam Jonas three years ago estimated the Jeep brand alone was worth 120% of the parent company’s market value — more than $20 billion at the time.
Last year, Fiat Chrysler sold 1.5 million Jeeps globally, down from 1.6 million in 2018. That seems like a distant target for the resurrected Bronco, for which Ford has relatively modest aspirations: About 125,000 sales in its first year, suppliers say. Sales of the earlier Bronco peaked in 1979 at around 100,000.
Ford hinted at the general shape and size of the new Bronco last fall when it revealed a racing version called Bronco R.

The new model goes into production this spring at Ford’s Wayne, Michigan, plant. The 2021 Bronco Sport, which shares underpinnings with the Ford Escape, is slated for production this fall at Ford’s Hermosillo plant in Mexico.

1508,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 12, 2020 07:51PM ET</span>",Wall Street dazed and confused after worst day since 1987,"By Noel Randewich
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - As trading ended on Thursday in Wall Street's worst day for three decades, shell-shocked investors had no idea how much further the market was likely to fall as the coronavirus pandemic spread fear of a global recession.
A 16-day drop of almost 27% in the S&P 500 has left portfolios in tatters. The suspension of professional sports games, canceled conventions and half-empty restaurants has raised fears - not about whether the longest U.S. economic expansion on record is ending - but about how deep a now presumed recession will be.
""This was worse than any day in 2008. It was worse than Sept. 11. I started in 1993 and this was the most panicked market I've ever seen,"" said Christopher Stanton, chief investment officer at Sunrise Capital Partners LLC in San Diego. ""People are just trading on conjectures stacked on additional conjectures.""
Drops of 10% in the Dow Jones Industrial Average and 9.5% in the S&P 500 were the worst for both since 1987. On Oct. 19, 1987, now known as ""Black Monday,"" the Dow crashed 22.6% in its biggest ever-single day decline.
Wall Street's most recent selloff comes as countries around the world grapple with how to contain the fast-moving coronavirus and its economic effects.
The velocity and depth of the drop has shocked investors accustomed to a decade of gains on Wall Street that were interrupted by only a handful of corrections.
""Fear of missing out has turned into fear of the unknown,"" lamented John McClain, fixed income portfolio manager at Diamond Hill Capital Management, in Columbus, Ohio. ""We haven't seen a situation like this before.""
(GRAPHIC: Bear Markets - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/3349/3310/Bear%20Markets.png)
The S&P 500's rout has left it trading at under 16 times expected earnings, its lowest level since early 2019, according to Refinitiv Datastream. But that figure offers little confidence because earnings estimates for companies are likely to fall as corporations provide more details about how badly they have been hurt by the virus that broke out in China late last year and has now spread across the globe.
""With a recession all but guaranteed at this point and the S&P 500 entering bear market territory today, one question worth asking is, how much is priced in?,"" Bespoke Investment Group wrote in a research note.
Reflecting that uncertainty, the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX), known as Wall Street's ""fear gauge,"" jumped on Thursday in its biggest-ever one-day surge.
""This is not an economic problem - there are ramifications of it that are economic - but the problem is this virus and the panic it is causing,"" said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment strategist at Inverness Counsel in New York. ""Is the panic overdone? I would say it is definitely overdone, but that doesn't stop people from being freaked out.""
That panic spread beyond stocks, with demand for dollars via the currency derivative market surging to its highest level for years in a sign that coronavirus-induced economic stress is starting to manifest itself in a broad scramble for greenback funding.
Among the victims of Wall Street's implosion is U.S. President Donald Trump, who touted a stunning run-up in the stock market as evidence of his success in the White House. Most of those gains have now evaporated.
(GRAPHIC: The Trump Slump - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/3342/3303/Trump%20Slump.png)
Investors are also becoming increasingly concerned that the coronavirus outbreak will hit U.S. corporate cash flow if it keeps workers at home or prevents companies from paying employees. Bond funds have taken a hit and companies including Boeing (N:BA) are drawing on credit lines.
Traders expect the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates again aggressively at its policy meeting next week to counter the coronavirus. That followed the Fed's surprise 50 basis rate cut last week, which failed to stabilize markets.
""We have to see coordinated fiscal and monetary policy, as well as government,"" said McClain. ""People need to know there's a plan in place. This isn't Twitter. You have got to have details."""

While Kroger placed a limit on the number of cold, flu and sanitary products per order, a spokeswoman for Walgreens said it was limiting disinfectant wipes and cleaners, face masks, hand sanitizers, thermometers and gloves to four each per customer.
Deerfield, Illinois-based Walgreens also said it is waiving delivery fees for all eligible prescription drugs during the outbreak and would offer free delivery on any purchase on Walgreens.com until further notice.

MONTREAL/BEIJING (Reuters) - New U.S. restrictions on Europeans entering the United States are fueling additional bookings for business jet flights, which were already in higher demand this year because of coronavirus, executives said on Thursday.
Travelers (NYSE:TRV) are rushing to return to the United States before a 30-day U.S. ban starts on Friday on foreign citizens entering the country if they have traveled to Europe in recent weeks.
The U.S. order, announced Wednesday to curtail the coronavirus outbreak, applies to citizens of 26 European countries but excludes Britain and Ireland as well as American citizens.
""We're seeing a significant number of requests in the past few hours from Americans currently in Europe, looking to fly back to the U.S.,"" said Adam Twidell, chief executive of Private Fly, a global booking service for charter flights.
While airlines hit by the outbreak are bracing for a further blow from the new restrictions, Private Fly and others have seen higher demand this year from affluent customers keen to avoid commercial flights and potential coronavirus exposure.
Given market turmoil, it is not yet clear whether demand for private flights will translate into new orders for planes from jet makers like France's Dassault Aviation (PA:AVMD), Canada's Bombardier (TO:BBDb) and Gulfstream (N:GD).
""Business aviation follows the economy. If the economy does well, we sell more business jets. If the economy performs badly, we sell less,"" Dassault Aviation Chief Executive Éric Trappier told reporters earlier this month in Montreal.
But given the outbreak, ""one would think that it’s safer to fly in a plane where there are fewer passengers than in a large plane with a lot of passengers,"" he said.
VistaJet said on Thursday that its total number of flights year-to-date have grown 16% on an annual basis, while private jet operator GlobeAir said on Wednesday its bookings jumped nearly 30% since the coronavirus started spreading widely in Italy and other parts of Europe.
Air Partner (L:AIRA) said on Thursday it has seen more requests for corporate shuttles due to coronavirus, while Canadian fractional charter company AirSprint has seen a 31% increase in flying in February, compared with the same month in 2019, said Chief Operating Officer James Elian.
Jackie Wu, president of Hong Kong-based JetSolution Aviation Group, said she is seeing more requests from companies and for longer-range travel from the United States.

(Reuters) - Growth in cloud business helped  Oracle Corp  (NYSE:ORCL) top quarterly profit and revenue on Thursday and said the coronavirus will have ""minimal impact"" on the fourth-quarter revenue, which is usually skewed toward software licenses rather than hardware.
""We expect minimal impact from the virus in the quarter, given that much of the subscription revenue is already contracted,"" Chief Executive Officer Safra Catz said on an earnings call with investors.
The business software maker's cloud services and license support unit, which accounts for more than half of its revenue, grew 4% to $6.93 billion in the third quarter.
Oracle has been trying catch up with rivals such as Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) in cloud business that helps companies save cost by renting data centers rather than owning them.
""It was the February quarter, so we didn't see the full impact of coronavirus but it is encouraging to see that there doesn't seem to have been a lot of impact so far,"" said Michael Turits from brokerage Raymond James. 
Oracle said last month it added new data centers in five countries and plans to add 36 locations by the end of the year.
Total revenue rose nearly 2% to $9.8 billion, beating analysts' average estimate of $9.75 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. 
Net income fell to $2.57 billion in the quarter ended Feb. 29, from $2.75 billion. But on a per share basis, it rose to 79 cents per share from 76 cents a year earlier.
On an adjusted basis, the Redwood, California-based company earned 97 cents per share, a cent above expectations.

1512,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 12, 2020 06:28PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch for March 13,"By Kim Khan 
Investing.com - Wall Street closed at its lows of the session Thursday, firmly in bear-market territory, with the Dow posting a whopping 10% drop. That’s the kind of plunge in the blue-chip index that can earn a day a nickname with “Black” in front, with the drop rivaled only by the crashes of 1929 and 1987.
And the week’s not over yet.
Investors face one more trading day – Friday the 13th – that could bring a host of more government restrictions to curb the spread of Covid-19. But any moves, especially in the U.S., to soften the economic impact of the virus could bring in some buyers.
Here are three things that could move markets tomorrow.
1. Watching Congress and News Tickers Closely
The U.S. House of Representatives is still planning on voting for a Democratic-authored legislative package in response to Covid-19 tonight, but any legislation will need Republican support in the Senate.
That’s looking unlikely as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell called it an “ideological wish list” for Democrats, the Louisville Courier Journal reported.
The package includes paid sick leave, enhanced unemployment benefits, supplement food assistance programs and free testing for the novel coronavirus.
But McConnell has said the Senate will not go into recess next week, so reports of progress in a deal the White House would be amenable to could lift sentiment. House Majority Leader Nancy Pelosi has been in contact about the legistlation with Treasury Secretary Stephen Mnuchin.
But that would be balanced by more headlines on the spread of the disease.
Late today, an Ohio health official estimated that as many as 100,000 people in the state have the virus, The Hill reported. Disney decided to close its California theme parks. And Belgium closed all schools, bars and restaurants.
2. More Fed Repo Action to Come
The Federal Reserve’s decision to provide $1.5 trillion in short-term funding was a brief ray of hope for bulls in today’s trading, but the selling soon resumed.
If the Fed wanted to boost asset prices with the decision it missed the mark. But it’s still fulfilling its repurchase agreement mission of providing liquidity to cash-strapped financial markets.
In its $500 billion repo operation today, dealers received $78.4 billion. Along with other repo programs, new operations totaled $276.5 billion, The Wall Street Journal reported.
On Friday the New York Fed will “further offer $500 billion in a three-month repo operation and $500 billion in a one-month repo operation for same day settlement.”
And with markets still swooning there will be some holding out for another Fed emergency rate cut tomorrow, bringing forth any action it may have planned at its meeting next week.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) said today it now expects the Fed to cut by 100 basis points at the meeting, down to a range of 0% to 0.25%, in “light of the continued growth in coronavirus cases in the U.S. and globally, the sharp further tightening in financial conditions, and rising risks to the economic outlook”.
3. Finally Some March Data
While the latest economic numbers have felt stale giving the changing environment around the coronavirus, tomorrow brings some insight into more recent conditions.
The University of Michigan will release its preliminary measure of March consumer confidence at 10 AM ET (14:00 GMT).
The consumer sentiment index is expected to drop (unsurprisingly) to 95 from 101 in February, according to economists’ forecasts compiled by Investing.com.
That would put the index around the same levels that it was at the end of last summer, which seems slightly incongruous.
Even more enlightening may be the expectations component, which is seen falling to 88.2."

(Reuters) - Workplace communication platform Slack Technologies Inc forecast a soft revenue outlook for the first quarter on Thursday, sending its shares down more than 20% aftermarket, on a day major U.S. stock indexes went into a tailspin amid coronavirus fears.
The company warned the coronavirus outbreak could hurt demand for its products as companies might cut back on technology spending and also forecast billings for fiscal 2021 well below analysts' estimates.
""Forward guidance is a little lighter than you'd expect out of a high-multiple name,"" said Rishi Jaluria from research firm DA Davidson and Co.
For the first quarter, Slack expects revenue of $185 million to $188 million, lower than analysts' average estimate of $188.4 million, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. 
The company said it expects billings of $970 million to $1 billion for fiscal 2021, lower than analysts' average estimate of $1.02 billion.
Slack, which has been called an ""email killer"", competes directly with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) Corp's workplace messaging platform, Teams, which surpassed 20 million daily active users in November last year.
Slack said it had over 110,000 paid users at the end of the fourth quarter, up 25% from last year. As a result, revenue rose 49% to $181.9 million, beating analysts' estimate of $174.1 million.

WASHINGTON/SEATTLE (Reuters) - Washington state on Thursday moved to formally repeal an aerospace tax break that benefited U.S. planemaker Boeing (N:BA) and avert looming European Union tariffs on U.S. goods.
Boeing said the move would bring the United States into compliance with World Trade Organization (WTO) rules, but Europe's Airbus said it marked only ""initial steps"" toward resolving a longstanding transatlantic dispute over aircraft subsidies.
The Geneva-based WTO has found that Boeing and Airbus (PA:AIR), the world's two largest planemakers, received billions of dollars of unfair subsidies in cases dating back to 2004. It has faulted both sides for failing to comply fully with previous rulings, opening the door to a tariff war.
The Washington state Senate voted on Thursday to remove the contested aerospace tax break for Boeing, sending the measure to Washington state Governor Jay Inslee for a potential signature.
""Today's repeal by Washington state of its aerospace business and occupation tax rate brings the United States into full WTO compliance by fixing the single finding against the U.S.,"" Boeing said in a statement.
The move came ahead of an expected decision this spring from the WTO that would allow the EU to impose tariffs on an as yet undetermined amount of U.S. imports. Makers of products ranging from luxury goods to whisky have raised concerns about a tit-for-tat tariff war spreading beyond the aerospace industry.
Airbus said it was up to the WTO to decide if the move got rid of all Washington state subsidies that were found to be illegal, but said the U.S. Trade Representative still needed to address billions of dollars in further subsidies provided to Boeing by the state of Kansas and federal agencies such as NASA.
""After 14 years of denial, finally there is a clear admission that there have been WTO-inconsistent subsidies from Washington State,"" said Airbus spokesman Clay McConnell.
The EU had challenged Washington state's preferential state tax rate for aerospace introduced 16 years ago and renewed in 2013 to help attract production work for Boeing's 777X.
If signed into law, the changes would remove the 40% saving on Business and Occupation tax, which saved Boeing some $118 million in 2018 based on published jetliner revenues.
The United States in February toughened its own tariffs on Airbus aircraft after winning approval last year from the WTO to penalize $7.5 billion in European goods over Airbus subsidies.

A ruling in the parallel EU case is expected in coming months.

(Reuters) - For three years, U.S. President Donald Trump has touted a stunning run-up in the stock market as evidence of his success in the White House. In the space of three weeks, most of those gains have evaporated. 
As the coronavirus pandemic spreads fear of a recession, the stock market's rise under the Republican president, a major part of his case for reelection in November, is now less than half of the gain of his predecessor and rival Barack Obama at the same point in his presidency. 
At its peak on Feb. 19, the S&P 500 (SPX) was up 58% from when Trump unexpectedly beat Democratic rival Hillary Clinton in November 2016. As of Thursday, Trump's stock market was up just 17%. The S&P 500 gained 41% in same number of days after Obama was elected president in 2008.
Measuring from Trump's inauguration on Jan 20, 2017, the S&P 500 is now up less than 10%, compared to a gain of 70% under Obama during the same span of his first term.

Trump, who has repeatedly boasted on Twitter and to reporters of the stock market's performance in recent years, on Thursday played down the carnage wracking Wall Street. 
""We have a lot of things that we're working on with the financial markets, and it's going to work out fine,"" Trump told reporters. 
""You have to remember the stock market, as an example, is still much higher than when I got here. And it's taken a big hit, but it's going to all bounce back, and it's going to bounce back very big at the right time.""
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) tumbled nearly 10% on Thursday, its worst day since 1987 after Trump announced a sweeping move to restrict travel from Europe. S&P 500 futures tumbled late on Wednesday, seconds after he announced the travel ban in a televised address.
As fears grew that Washington has not done enough to prepare for the growing pandemic, the S&P 500 on Thursday sank another 9.5% in a dramatic end to a bull market that started during Obama's presidency in the aftermath of the financial crisis, and that lasted 11 years.
In the early months of Trump's first term, Wall Street, led by banks, surged on expectations that Republicans would slash regulations, a promise Trump fulfilled. Later gains were driven by historic tax cuts that freed up money for companies to spend on dividends and stock buybacks, which reached record levels.

As of Monday, the recent sell-off had cost the average person in the United States about $16,000, mostly through retirement plans and not accounting for wealth disparities, according to a study.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazilian stocks recorded their biggest one-day fall since 1998 and the currency touched a historic low as fears over economic damage from the global coronavirus pandemic triggered widespread selling.
Markets rallied off their lows in afternoon trading after the U.S. Federal Reserve intervened with a dramatic injection of up to $1.5 trillion to stabilize the financial system, which has been rocked by the global coronavirus pandemic.
But that was after the real fell below 5.00 per dollar for the first time ever (BRBY), prompting more dollar-selling intervention from the central bank, and after stock trading had been halted twice as the Bovespa index plunged almost 20%.
The real closed down around 1% at 4.7857 per dollar, having traded as low as 5.0287 per dollar. Despite its impressive recovery in late trading, it is still one of the world's worst-performing currencies against the dollar, down 16% this year.
The benchmark Bovespa stock index closed 15.15% lower at 72,269 points (BVSP), its biggest fall since September, 1998. Trading was halted twice on Thursday as automatic circuit breakers were triggered as the index fell 10%, and then 15%.
At these levels, the Bovespa is firmly on track for its biggest quarterly fall since the Real Plan to kill off hyper-inflation in Brazil was introduced in 1994.

The volatility spread to fixed income and rates markets. Longer-dated rates futures jumped as much as 100 basis points to the highest in almost a year as traders bet the central bank will eventually be forced to jack up interest rates to protect the currency and maintain capital inflows from abroad.
""Things can get worse before they get better,"" said Rico Investimentos, a brokerage in Sao Paulo.
Currency market volatility soared, with one-month dollar/real implied volatility reaching 23.8% and 3-month implied volatility scaling 20%, both the highest since October 2018 .

In an effort to calm the market, the central bank put at least $3.5 billion of dollar reserves up for auction, selling $1.78 billion. The central bank also coordinated with the Treasury to hold a series of bond auctions and buybacks in the coming week.
Traders also noted that a deterioration in the domestic political scenario, marked by a shock congressional vote on government spending late on Wednesday, also soured investor sentiment on Brazil. [nL8N2B563J]
""Such a serious setback for the reform agenda along with a more-than-challenging global backdrop will keep Brazilian local assets under pressure in the weeks to come,""  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) wrote in a note to clients on Thursday."
1521,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 12, 2020 04:49PM ET</span>",Treasuries Fail to Hold Gains Spurred by Fed’s Rescue Attempt,"(Bloomberg) -- U.S. Treasury yields beat a retreat from session highs Thursday after the Federal Reserve brandished its most aggressive market support measures since it was digging the economy out of the last recession. It didn’t last.
Yields across the curve climbed to their highest levels of the U.S. session in late trading. At the time of the surprise announcement at about 12:45 p.m. in New York, the two-year note’s yield fell more than 10 basis points to 0.38%. By 3 p.m., it had backed up to 0.50%, suggesting there’s doubt the measures will work. The dollar, which had climbed nearly 2% against a basket of major currencies, halved its gain. The S&P 500 Index remains down more than 8% on the day.
“It prevents the market from going into 2008 mode, but the issue is that the cash flow of business and households is going to take a hit,” said Steven Englander, head of G-10 currency and rates strategy at  Standard Chartered  (LON:STAN). “If the economy is to recover when disease conditions improve they have to keep going concerns afloat -- very different than even 2008.”
Yields further out the curve also declined after the Fed’s action, richening the price of the 30-year Treasury bond auction that closed at 1 p.m.
The Fed, which has been buying Treasury bills at a pace of $60 billion a month since October to account for a shortage of bank reserves, said that beginning Friday it would conduct those purchases across the full range of Treasury securities to address “highly unusual disruptions in Treasury financing markets associated with the coronavirus outbreak.” The decision amounted to a conversion of the reserve management purchases “into an outright QE,” Jefferies economic Ward McCarthy said in a note.
The central bank struck as markets were showing new signs of stress. The climb in yields suggested traders were offloading their most liquid assets to meet other obligations as conditions in risk markets worsened.
The transmission mechanism for QE is the “portfolio balance channel” which is when investors buy risky assets,” said Subadra Rajappa, rates strategist at  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) SA. “We are not seeing that reflected in the equity markets, at least not as of yet.”"

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street tanked on Thursday, slamming the book on the longest-ever U.S. bull market after new travel restrictions to curb the coronavirus spread spooked investors and rattled world markets. 
President Donald Trump's Europe travel ban, announced late Wednesday, sent all three major U.S. stock indexes into a tailspin, with the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq confirming their first bear market since the financial crisis.
The blue chip Dow suffered its worst one-day loss since October 1987's ""Black Monday.""
The benchmark S&P 500 and the Nasdaq have lost over a quarter of their value since reaching record closing highs just 16 sessions ago, as nations around the world grapple with how to contain the fast-moving coronavirus and its economic effects. 
A bear market is confirmed when an index sinks 20% or more below its most recent closing high.
""The continued negative action in the market is telling us whatever's been done so far hasn't been enough,"" said Joseph Sroka, chief investment officer at NovaPoint in Atlanta. ""People can't point to a tangible outcome that's going to restore normal daily life, so uncertainty remains.
""Prominent organizations, educational institutions and even sports leagues are foregoing events out of caution,"" Sroka added. ""Leading institutions around the world are setting the tone. We're cautious because they're telling us to be cautious."" 
Trump's sweeping travel restrictions, limiting flights from continental Europe to the United States, sent European shares (STOXX) to a near four-year low and slammed airline stocks, already battered by the spread of COVID-19.
On Wall Street, airlines <.SPCOMAIR> plummeted 19.6%.
 Boeing Co  (N:BA) fell another 18.1% as J.P.Morgan abandoned its long-term backing for the company's shares, setting the planemaker on course for its worst week ever.
The U.S. Federal Reserve is expected to cut interest rates for the second time this month at the conclusion of its two-day monetary policy scheduled for next week. 
U.S. Treasury yields tumbled as anticipation grew for aggressive easing on the part of the Fed.
The New York Federal Reserve announced on Thursday that it would introduce $1.5 trillion in new repo operations this week.
""Any government action that has dollars tied to it that's actionable for the banking system would be viewed as a positive,"" Sroka said. ""But what the market is looking for is tangible evidence that the government is trying to stave off a recession."" 
Interest rate-sensitive bank shares <.SPXBK> dropped 10.5%, while corporate credit worries hit bond fund prices as companies began to draw on credit lines.
The CBOE Volatility index (VIX), a gauge of investor anxiety, shot up to levels not seen since November 2008, the height of the financial crisis. 
The Trump travel ban also hit oil prices, sending front-month Brent crude down 8.6%. Oil prices were already under pressure after Saudi Arabia and Russia vowed to boost production, flooding the market with supply despite plummeting demand.
The S&P 500 Energy index (SPNY) lost 12.3%
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) fell 2,352.6 points, or 9.99%, to 21,200.62, the S&P 500 (SPX) lost 260.74 points, or 9.51%, to 2,480.64 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) dropped 750.25 points, or 9.43%, to 7,201.80.
All 11 major sectors of the S&P 500 closed sharply lower.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 23.77-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 17.69-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
The S&P 500 posted no new 52-week highs and 336 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 3 new highs and 1,573 new lows.

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 18.54 billion shares, compared with the 12.49 billion average over the last 20 trading days.

1529,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 12, 2020 04:07PM ET</span>",Stocks - Dow's Worst Loss Since '87 Crash; Fed Bazooka Fails to Halt Bears,"By Yasin Ebrahim 
Investing.com – The Dow plunged to its biggest-one day percentage loss since October 1987 as fears the spread of the novel coronavirus will pick up pace and usher in a global recession overshadowed the Federal Reserve's bold new stimulus measures to calm funding markets.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell nearly 10%, or 2,352 points, it worst one-day percentage drop since Black Monday when it lost 22.6%. It was the fourth-largest percentage drop for the blue chip index in history, rivaling those seen in 1929.
The S&P 500 plunged 9.5% and the Nasdaq Composite slumped 9.4%.
The rout on Wall Street for the second-straight day comes as investors upped their bearish bets on stocks despite the Federal Reserve unveiling $1.5 trillion in fresh liquidity to combat ""temporary disruptions"" in funding markets.
The short-term pause in selling following the Fed announcement proved short-lived as investor sentiment on stocks continued to be swayed by the latest updates on the spread of the coronavirus, or Covid-19, which has killed nearly 5,000 people, with infections topping 133,000 worldwide.
In the U.S., where infections are feared to increase in the coming weeks, state-wide bans on large gatherings to limit the virus impact continued, with New York announcing announce a ban on gatherings of 500 or more people.
Against the backdrop of rising infections in the U.S., Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told a House committee he was ""hopeful"" the first trial patient will receive a coronavirus vaccine in a few weeks rather than in two to three months, as had been initially anticipated.
The sea of red on Wall Street was led by a slump in energy as concerns over demand  - as a result of the virus –  were exacerbated after President Donald Trump revealed a travel ban for non-citizens and non-residents from 26 European countries - excluding the U.K and Ireland - into the U.S.
""Instead of instilling confidence, based on the market reaction afterwards, [the speech] had the opposite effect,"" said Phil Flynn at Price Futures in Chicago. ""The talk of an EU travel ban was a blow for energy demand that is already grappling with the double assault of a Saudi Arabia versus Russia price war as well as concern for more coronavirus drop in demand.""
Travel and airline also fell heavily, with Norwegian Cruise Line (NYSE:NCLH) down 36% and Carnival (NYSE:CCL) down 31%. American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) slumped 17.7% and United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) fell 25%. 
In tech, FANG stocks came under heavy pressure, with Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) falling more than 9%, and Google and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) down about 8%. Among the big tech stocks, however, Facebook has been touted as the best bet to weather the storm, according to MKM Partners. But Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s exposure to travel-related ads, however, makes the search-engine giant the most vulnerable to downside pressures, as travel demand has soured in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak, which has seen governments restrict travel.

1536,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 12, 2020 03:06PM ET</span>",Stocks Drop With Investors Urging Broader Response: Markets Wrap,"(Bloomberg) --
The rout in U.S. stocks accelerated as investors signaled the Federal Reserve’s extraordinary bond-buying measures and Donald Trump’s economic proposals won’t be enough to counter the economic impact from the coronavirus.
The S&P 500 Index tumbled more than 8% as the Dow Jones Industrial Average headed to its biggest loss since Black Monday of October 1987. Ten-year Treasury yields declined as policy makers’ pledge of $1.5 trillion in liquidity recalled the quantitative easing used during the financial crisis. Oil and precious metals slumped, with palladium falling into a bear market.
The stock rout was worldwide, with Europe’s benchmark index down 11% in a record drop. Brazil’s Ibovespa tumbled as much as 20% at one point, extending this year’s loss to almost 50% in dollar terms, and Canada’s main gauge was off more than 12%.
Investors are trying to guess at the effectiveness of policy makers’ measures to curb the spread of the coronavirus and limit its economic damage after Trump’s travel ban and tepid fiscal measures failed to impress most observers. Spirits were further damped by new bans on public gatherings in the U.S. and professional sports leagues’ move to suspend operations.
“We need to see what is effectively a ‘declaration of war’ against the virus and full support to offset the economic damage that war will cost,” said Peter Tchir, head of macro strategy at Academy Securities LLC. “Whatever has gone on this week, it’s not a liquidity crunch.”
On another bruising day across markets:
The S&P 500, Nasdaq Composite and Nasdaq 100 indexes sank deeper into a bear market, with losses from February closing records extending well past 20%.The slump triggered the second 15-minute trading halt this week shortly after the U.S. open.The MSCI All-Country World Index extended losses to enter bear-market territory.The cost of insuring debt issued by Europe’s investment grade companies surged to the highest since 2013.Japanese stocks closed more than 4% lower even after another liquidity pledge from the country’s central bank. Australian shares sunk deeper into a bear market despite a stimulus plan there.Oil extended losses toward 5%. Bitcoin slumped. Gold fell below $1,600 an ounce.More bad news about the impact of the coronavirus further sapped investor spirits. The leading U.S. infectious-disease official said the testing system in the country is failing. The European Union warned of sickness threatens to exceed health-care capacity across the region “in a few weeks or even days.” The National Hockey League followed the National Basketball Association’s lead and suspended its season.
“Market moves suggest monetary stimulus has reached its limits,” said Lucas Bouwhuis, a portfolio manager at Achmea Investment. “Most of the stimulus needs to come from the fiscal side and we are just not seeing enough of that yet.”
Meanwhile, signs that companies in the hardest-hit industries were drawing down credit lines to battle the effects of the virus on their businesses added to anxiety.
“The risks have definitely risen,” said Chris Gaffney, president of world markets at TIAA. “The question is how long will this last and I don’t think anybody can predict that at this point.”
These are the main moves in markets:
Stocks
The S&P 500 Index declined 8% as of 2:44 p.m. New York time.The Stoxx Europe 600 Index fell 11%.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index dipped 5.3%.The MSCI Emerging Market Index sank 6.5%.Currencies

Investing.com – Wall Street is teetering on the brink of a historic percentage slump in the Dow, but for investors looking to stick with big tech, Facebook is likely the best bet, MKM partners said.
Megacap technology and internet stocks are ""significantly diversified"" businesses that are better able to weather uncertainty than in the past, MKM Partners said, singling Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) out as the stock with the least downside risk, followed by Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and then Alphabet I(NASDAQ:GOOGL).
All three stocks were down more than 6% on Thursday.
The diversified businesses of tech stalwarts, including Facebook, Amazon and Google, offer ""greater resilience and likely a greater ability to endure dramatic body blows,"" the firm added.

1538,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 12, 2020 02:39PM ET</span>",Stocks - Bears Resume Grip on Dow as Fed-Stimulus Optimism Runs out of Steam,"By Yasin Ebrahim 
Investing.com – Selling resumed on Wall Street Thursday as the wave of buying following the Federal Reserve's bold liquidity package ran out of steam amid fears that extra stimulus will do little stem the coronavirus-led blow to global supply chains.
The S&P 500 fell 8.2% after cutting losses to around 3% on the Fed announcement. The Dow was off 8.6% and the Nasdaq Composite fell 7.9%.
The Federal Reserve announced measures to combat ""temporary disruptions"" in funding markets, pledging $1.5 trillion in fresh liquidity.
The central bank said it would offer $500 billion in a three-month repo operation today, which would be followed up with $500 billion in a three-month repo operation and $500 billion in a one-month repo operation.
The Fed has been supporting the short-term funding market for months now in an effort to avoid a repeat of the liquidity crunch in September last year, when short-term funding rates surged, triggering a sharp selloff on Wall Street.
The central bank has railed against calls that its liquidity purchases mark a new form of quantitative easing, stressing that its $60 billion balance sheet expansion was not QE because the purchases were short-term securities. But the Fed on Thursday said it would now extend its purchases “across a range of maturities” to include bills, notes, Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities as well as other instruments. The purchases start Thursday and would continue through April 13.
Travel and cruise stocks were the worst hit, with Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings (NYSE:NCLH) down 25% and Carnival Corporation (NYSE:CCL) down 16%.  American Airlines Group  (NASDAQ:AAL) was down 8% and United Airlines Holdings (NASDAQ:UAL) slumped 17%.
In the U.S., New York became the latest state to announce a ban on gatherings of 500 or more people to limit the outbreak.

1542,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 12, 2020 02:01PM ET</span>",Fed Unveils Dramatic Measures to Ease Market Strain from Virus,"(Bloomberg) -- The Federal Reserve took aggressive steps Thursday to ease what it called “temporary disruptions” in Treasuries, flooding the market with liquidity and widening its purchases of U.S. government securities in a measure that recalls the quantitative easing it used during the financial crisis.
The Federal Reserve Bank of New York said in a statement that the “changes are being made to address highly unusual disruptions in Treasury financing markets associated with the coronavirus outbreak” and had been done at the direction of Fed Chairman Jerome Powell in consultation with the Federal Open Market Committee.
Under the Fed’s existing program to buy $60 billion a month in securities, the purchases will be widened to include coupon-bearing notes across a range of maturities to match the maturity composition of the Treasury market, it said.
Treasuries resumed rising and stocks pared losses after the surprise announcement, made about 10 minutes before the bidding deadline for $16 billion auction of new 30-year bonds. The current 30-year yield quickly shed about 10 basis points to 1.25% ahead of the auction as investors absorbed the Fed’s muscular move.
“This is a full-blown crisis response operation, intended to make it abundantly clear that the Fed will not allow liquidity to dry up,” said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist of Pantheon Macroeconomics. “We expect the Fed to purchase $60 billion of securities across the spectrum for the foreseeable future: QE4 is here.”
In addition, the New York Fed offered $500 billion in a three-month repo operation and said it would repeat the exercise tomorrow, along with another $500 billion in a one-month operation, and continue on a weekly basis for the rest of the monthly calendar. This adds a massive jolt of liquidity to financial markets that will also expand the Fed’s balance sheet for the duration of the operations.
The Fed has been under increasing pressure to act as investors lost faith the U.S. government’s ability to quickly produce a coherent policy response after President Donald Trump addressed the nation Wednesday with few details on fiscal stimulus plans but restrictions on travel from Europe to the U.S. that deepened the sense of alarm.
“President Trump set out to calm everyone’s concerns, and he added fuel to the fire,” said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer of Cresset Capital Management, a Chicago-based wealth-management firm. “Right now, if you look at the technicals, we had finally slipped into what I’d call panic.”
U.S. central bankers delivered an emergency half percentage-point cut last week and were expected to move again when they meet on March 17-18 in Washington, if not sooner, with some economists predicting they could slash rates to zero from 1% to 1.25% at the moment.
“Fed did its part today of helping with market functioning,” said Priya Misra, head of rates strategy at TD Securities. “We still need the fiscal help.”"

U.S. stocks extended declines as pessimism took hold after a brief respite when the Federal Reserve expanded plans to buy government bonds and alleviate what it called “temporary disruptions” in financing markets.
The S&P 500 Index tumbled about 7% after paring losses to as low as 3% in the immediate aftermath of the Fed’s announcement. Ten-year Treasury yields declined as the Fed’s announcement recalled the quantitative easing it used during the financial crisis. Oil slumped along with gold. European stocks tumbled 11% in a record rout.
Investors are trying to guess at the effectiveness of policy makers’ measures to curb the spread of the coronavirus and limit its economic damage after President Donald Trump’s travel ban and tepid fiscal measures failed to impress most observers. The European Central Bank couldn’t stem the rout after it left rates unchanged, though it temporarily increased its bond buying program and took steps to boost liquidity.
“We need to see what is effectively a ‘declaration of war’ against the virus and full support to offset the economic damage that war will cost,” said Peter Tchir, head of macro strategy at Academy Securities LLC. “Whatever has gone on this week, it’s not a liquidity crunch.”
On another bruising day across markets:
The S&P 500, Nasdaq Composite and Nasdaq 100 indexes sank deeper into a bear market, with losses from February closing records extending well past 20%.The slump triggered the second 15-minute trading halt this week shortly after the U.S. open.The MSCI All-Country World Index extended losses to enter bear-market territory.The Stoxx Europe 600 tumbled the most on record, with trading volumes more than double the 100-day average. The cost of insuring debt issued by Europe’s investment grade companies surged to the highest since 2013.Japanese stocks closed more than 4% lower even after another liquidity pledge from the country’s central bank. Australian shares were among the worst performing worldwide, sinking deeper into a bear market despite a stimulus plan there. India’s benchmark fell more than 8%.Oil extended losses toward 5%. Bitcoin slumped. Gold fell below $1,600 an ounce.Trump unveiled steps including lending aid for small businesses and asked Congress to pass undefined payroll-tax relief, but his Oval Office address gave the market little confidence that the U.S. is tightening its grip on the virus or its economic impact. America canceled more events, the basketball league suspended play and businesses ordered employees to work from home.
“Market moves suggest monetary stimulus has reached its limits,” said Lucas Bouwhuis, a portfolio manager at Achmea Investment. “Most of the stimulus needs to come from the fiscal side and we are just not seeing enough of that yet.”
Meanwhile, signs that companies in the hardest-hit industries were drawing down credit lines to battle the effects of the virus on their businesses added to anxiety.
“The risks have definitely risen,” said Chris Gaffney, president of world markets at TIAA. “The question is how long will this last and I don’t think anybody can predict that at this point.”
These are the main moves in markets:

The yield spread between 10-year Italian and German government debt had widened to its most in nine months during Lagarde's press conference, when she affected indifference to a selloff that has gathered pace in recent days as the coronavirus emergency has revived fears for the country's debt sustainability.
""We are not here to close spreads, there are other tools and other actors to deal with these issues,"" Lagarde had said. 
The comments contrasted sharply with the approach taken by her predecessor Mario Draghi, whose promise to do ""whatever it takes"" to save the euro was a direct response to markets driving the German-Italian yield spread to unsustainable levels for the Italian government and banking system. 
 ""I am really committed to avoid any fragmentation in a difficult moment for the euro area,"" Lagarde said later in an interview with CNBC, referring to Draghi's arguments that high spreads mean that the ECB is effectively no longer setting a single interest rate for the currency zone. ""The high spreads that we see due to the coronavirus clearly impair monetary policy.""
Lagarde also told CNBC that the ECB would use the measures it announced on Thursday, including the expansion of its bond-buying program, ""forcefully, with determination, and using the flexibility that we have.""
Markets were still only half-convinced by the clarification. By 12:04 PM ET (1604 GMT), the spread was back at 247 basis points, still 50 basis points wider than before the ECB announced its package of easing measures. In absolute terms, the Italian 10-year benchmark yielded 1.79%, up 60 basis points from Wednesday and its highest since last August.
Italian bank stocks, meanwhile, were still among the worst performing in Europe, losing between 15% and 18%. Italian bank stocks are closely correlated to the sovereign spread because of the enormous amount of Italian government bonds on their balance sheet.

The rout in global stocks deepened as investors showed a lack of faith in the U.S. and European policy responses to the worsening spread of the coronavirus. The dollar surged.
The S&P 500 Index plunged as much 8.5% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average posted its biggest loss since the flash crash in May 2010. European stocks tumbled 12% in a record intraday rout. The selling that started the U.S. day triggered a 15-minute NYSE-mandated halt, and trading will stop again if S&P 500 losses reach 13% any time before 3:25 p.m. in New York.
Ten-year Treasury yields declined, but came off their lows of the day. Oil dropped along with gold. Brazil’s currency fell to a record.
President Donald Trump’s travel ban and tepid fiscal measures failed to impress investors, sparking the latest leg down in risk assets. The European Central Bank failed to stem the rout after it left rates unchanged, though it temporarily increased its bond buying program and took steps to boost liquidity. The World Health Organization earlier called the outbreak a pandemic and other countries, such as the U.K., have taken more extreme measures to try to blunt the threat to growth.
“At this stage people are panicking,” said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist for MUFG Union Bank. “The other shoe keeps dropping in a way we can’t foresee.”
On another bruising day across markets:
The S&P 500, Nasdaq Composite and Nasdaq 100 indexes sank deeper into a bear market, with losses from February closing records extending past 20%.The MSCI All-Country World Index extended losses to enter bear-market territory.The Stoxx Europe 600 tumbled the most on record, with trading volumes more than double the 100-day average. The cost of insuring debt issued by Europe’s investment grade companies surged to the highest since 2016.Japanese stocks closed more than 4% lower even after another liquidity pledge from the country’s central bank. Australian shares were among the worst performing worldwide, sinking deeper into a bear market despite a stimulus plan there. India’s benchmark fell more than 8%.Oil extended losses toward 5%. Bitcoin slumped. Gold fell below $1,600 an ounce.Trump unveiled steps including lending aid for small businesses and asked Congress to pass undefined payroll-tax relief, but his Oval Office address gave the market little confidence that the U.S. is tightening its grip on the virus or its economic impact. America cancelled more events, the basketball league suspended play and businesses ordered employees to work from home.
“Market moves suggest monetary stimulus has reached its limits,” said Lucas Bouwhuis, a portfolio manager at Achmea Investment. “Most of the stimulus needs to come from the fiscal side and we are just not seeing enough of that yet.”
Meanwhile, signs that companies in the hardest-hit industries were drawing down credit lines to battle the effects of the virus on their businesses added to anxiety.
“The risks have definitely risen,” said Chris Gaffney, president of world markets at TIAA. “The question is how long will this last and I don’t think anybody can predict that at this point.”
These are the main moves in markets:

1560,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 12, 2020 11:56AM ET</span>",Coronavirus could cost U.S. advertising industry billions,"By Sheila Dang and Helen Coster
(Reuters) - The U.S. advertising industry could face steep losses as sports leagues cancel or postpone live events and consumers spend less while many stay at home during the coronavirus outbreak, experts said on Thursday.
With companies widely expected to slash marketing budgets, the ad industry could see nearly $26 billion in lost revenue, or a 10.6% decline, Michael Nathanson, an analyst at MoffettNathanson, estimated in a research note on Thursday.
The coronavirus effect on live sports, one of the last remaining categories that continues to attract large audiences and therefore advertisers to traditional television, could ""accelerate a meltdown"" for TV advertising, said Richard Greenfield, a media analyst at Lightshed Partners.
Ad revenue losses will likely be seen first in the digital market dominated by Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google and  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) because the spending is more easily adjusted, followed by traditional media like TV, according to Nathanson.
The National Basketball Association said Wednesday it was suspending the current season after a player was diagnosed with coronavirus, and the National Hockey League said it was ""evaluating the options"" and expected to have further updates on Thursday about its season, which begins in September.
The PGA began its Players Championship golf tournament on Thursday as usual, but said it would continue to review the situation and give an update later in the day.
""This is an unprecedented situation that media networks have not planned for,"" Greenfield said.
Most of the NBA season has been played, and what happens to the playoffs will be the question for AT&T Inc's TNT network and Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co's ABC and ESPN networks, which hold broadcast rights for NBA games. Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) Corp's NBC Sports airs NHL games.
Broadcast rights holders will likely still have to pay their fees to the NBA even if games do not air, and even though the NBA is required to compensate the networks for any lost advertising revenue and fees, those calculations will be complicated, Greenfield said.
The National Collegiate Athletic Association said Wednesday its March Madness basketball tournaments, which begin next week and will air on ViacomCBS Inc's CBS and AT&T's Turner networks, will be played without spectators.
The blow to the ad industry is not restricted to the United States, and China's advertising industry has been hit hard by the epidemic. According to a survey Chinese industry magazine Modern Advertising conducted with 112 advertising companies, 95% of respondents said their first quarter revenue would drop, and of those who said so, 53% described it as a severe decline or devastating blow.
Some analysts, however, believe the impact could be short-lived. ""While we expect an epidemic in the US will cause contraction in advertising revenues, we expect it to normalize after the threat passes."" wrote Moody's Senior Vice President Neil Begley in a report Wednesday, prior to the NBA announcement.
Although the extent and length of the virus's impact is hard to predict, Moody's forecast assumes economic activity will bounce back in the second half of the year if the spread of the virus in the Northern Hemisphere subsides in warmer weather and efforts to slow the virus globally succeed.
Nathanson did not put a specific time frame around his forecast for a nearly $26 billion decline in ad industry revenues."

PARIS/LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Airlines bore the brunt of a dramatic expansion of the coronavirus crisis on Thursday, as U.S. travel curbs on much of continental Europe deepened the sector's misery and piled more pressure on governments to offer emergency support.
The 30-day restrictions will badly disrupt transatlantic traffic key to the earnings of major European carriers and their U.S. airline partners, analysts warned, as the move hit travel stocks already battered by the virus outbreak.
Those routes account for 20-30% of large European operators' revenue and a majority of profit,  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) analyst Neil Glynn warned, ""highlighting the damage to revenue lines for the coming weeks and potentially well into the summer."" 
Glynn added: ""A ban on travel to the U.S. will likely mean heavier cuts"" than the drastic capacity reductions already ordered as airlines scrapped flights - first to China and then to other destinations including Italy as the virus spread.
Shares in European and U.S. airlines slumped in turn to new lows, with Delta (N:DAL) and United Airlines (O:UAL) down more than 13% and American Airlines (O:AAL) 7.2% lower.
Air France-KLM (PA:AIRF) was down 9.1% at 1506 GMT, with British Airways parent IAG (L:ICAG) down 10.7% and Lufthansa (DE:LHAG) 11.5% lower. Troubled Norwegian Air (OL:NWC) and U.S.-dependent Icelandair (IC:ICEAIR) both plunged more than 20%.
The U.S. curbs on travel from the 26-country Schengen Area - which excludes Britain and Ireland - are similar to restrictions on China that took effect on Feb. 1 and do not apply to U.S. residents or their immediate family.
""The ban effectively stops travel from the Schengen Area to the USA,"" said Bernstein analyst Daniel Roeska - predicting a ""more substantial"" earnings impact than European carriers had suffered from the earlier China flight suspensions.
U.S. airlines had already cut flight schedules to Italy and will take another hit from lower demand for flights from major destinations such as France and Germany.
Among them, American Airlines could be relatively spared by its alliance with British Airways (BA) and higher share of UK traffic, while Air France-KLM partner Delta and Lufthansa ally United Airlines are likely to suffer more, analysts say.
U.S. Vice President Mike Pence defended the travel curbs on Thursday, after the European Union complained they had been imposed ""unilaterally and without consultation"".
The virus has taken root in the United States after spreading from China to Italy, South Korea, Iran and elsewhere.
'TOTAL MELTDOWN'
Airlines had already been scrambling to respond to a global travel slump that looks increasingly likely to require government aid to avoid widespread insolvencies. The EU will publish new state-aid guidelines on Friday.
Germany may extend loans and other support to airlines, a government official said on Thursday. The French government also stands ready to help Air France-KLM, Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said.
""There is a need for measures from many governments,"" said Norwegian pilots' union president Yngve Carlsen. ""This could lead to a total meltdown.""
Scandinavian carrier SAS (ST:SAS) is in talks with the Swedish and Danish governments about potential support measures, a company spokeswoman said.
EU airlines have seized on the crisis to push back on green taxes designed to help the bloc meet climate goals - including proposals to end current tax exemptions on jet fuel.
""New fiscal burdens should be postponed until the industry is back on a sound operational and financial footing,"" lobby group Airlines for Europe said.
CRITICAL TIME
The latest travel clampdown could make coronavirus worse than previous aviation crises including the 9/11 attacks of 2001, UK-based consultant John Strickland said.
""It's coming at the end of the northern hemisphere winter, which is a weak period for airline finances (when) they should be sowing seeds of a strong summer season by getting the bookings in,"" he said.
Air France-KLM and Lufthansa said they were still studying the implications of the U.S. move for flight schedules. IAG is potentially less impacted thanks to BA's Heathrow base.
There were panicky European airport scenes as travelers scrambled to fly to the United States before the restrictions take effect late on March 13.
The fallout is also spreading fast from travel and tourism to aerospace and other industries.
 Safran  (PA:SAF), the world's third-biggest aerospace group, sees a growing threat to aircraft and engine order books, Chief Executive Philippe Petitcolin said on Thursday, adding more cost cuts were now being drawn up.
ADP (PA:ADP) declined to comment on a report it was preparing to close Terminal 3 at Roissy Charles de Gaulle, the French capital's main aviation hub. Norway may close several airports, operator Avinor said.
Italy announced the partial closure of Rome's main airports to commercial aviation in response to its own travel lockdown. Near-empty airports in Milan and elsewhere may follow, a government source told Reuters.
(GRAPHIC: European airlines crater - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/3299/3260/airlines.png) 
The travel curbs will also decimate European tourists' spending in the United States. In March 2019, European visitors accounted for 29% of arrivals and $3.4 billion in spending, the U.S. Travel Association said.

""Temporarily shutting off travel from Europe is going to exacerbate the already-heavy impact of coronavirus on the travel industry and the 15.7 million Americans whose jobs depend on travel,"" U.S. Travel Association President Roger Dow said.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - German carrier Lufthansa (DE:LHAG) has been forced by the coronavirus epidemic to halt the sale of the international operations of its airline caterer LSG, two people close to the matter said.
Airlines around the globe are feeling the pain as travel demand withers because of the coronavirus outbreak. Several have grounded many flights and ditched their financial outlooks.
European airline stocks plunged as much as 20% on Thursday after U.S. President Donald Trump said he would restrict travel from Europe to the United States for 30 days to try to contain the spread of the coronavirus.
The German government will meet representatives of airlines and labour unions on Monday to discuss the impact of the coronavirus outbreak and possible liquidity aid.
Even before the pandemic broke out, Lufthansa Chief Executive Carsten Spohr said that the airline's catering business faced challenges because of the large number of locations it serves, high staff costs and exposure to currency exchange rates.
However, Lufthansa managed to negotiate a deal to sell the European operations of LSG to Switzerland-based Gategroup, in December.
That deal is going ahead as planned, the sources said.
Lufthansa declined to comment.
The auction for the international business launched only weeks ago with information packages being sent out to prospective bidders, who were asked to sign confidentiality agreements.
Lufthansa has been hoping to reap a valuation of roughly 1 billion euros ($1.11 billion) from a sale of the international catering operations to a peer such as Gategroup, Dnata, SATS or private equity firms, people close to the matter have said.
""Lufthansa has to wait until it can fly normally again and define the virus impact on the catering unit before continuing with the auction"", one of the people said."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The New York Stock Exchange does not currently plan to close its trading floor and the markets are functioning as expected, even as concerns over the coronavirus cause sharp spikes in volatility, NYSE President Stacey Cunningham said on Thursday.
""If there is an outbreak, we can clean the floor pretty quickly and reopen as well,"" she told CNBC in an interview. ""We are not planning to close the floor at this time,"" she said of the NYSE, which is owned by Intercontinental Exchange Inc (N:ICE).
On Wednesday, the exchange operator outlined measures to reduce the chance that the virus will affect the trading floor, according to an internal memo. Steps included mandating separate entrances and eating spaces for floor traders and NYSE and ICE employees that work in the office tower at 11 Wall Street.
Futures exchange operator CME Group (NASDAQ:CME) said late on Wednesday it was closing its trading floor until further notice as a precaution and that all trading would be done electronically.
Concerns over how the fast-spreading coronavirus will affect the economy have pummeled markets, with volumes and volatility spiking to levels not seen since the 2007-2009 financial crisis.
Stock trading was temporarily halted market-wide shortly after the open on both Monday and Thursday as ""circuit breakers"" kicked in due to steep declines in share prices.
While most exchanges are fully electronic, the NYSE uses a hybrid model, with traders known as designated market makers deciding when to open stocks electronically, or through a more manual process if needed to dampen sharp price moves.
The exchange is prepared to run fully electronically if needed and stocks can be opened remotely, but right now the hybrid model is benefiting the market, Cunningham said.
""There are more stocks that we actually want to apply that human judgment to because they open with less volatility and investors get better prices,"" Cunningham said of the current trading environment."

1571,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 12, 2020 10:00AM ET</span>",European Stocks Plunge Most This Century After ECB Underwhelms,"(Bloomberg) -- European stocks posted their steepest drop this century as investors already reeling from the U.S. travel ban were left underwhelmed by the European Central Bank’s policy measures to combat the impact of the coronavirus.
The Stoxx Europe 600 Index dropped as much as 10% after the ECB’s decision to keep key rates unchanged, while boosting quantitative easing and liquidity tools. All 19 industry groups tumbled at least 9%, the travel and leisure extending its streak as the current sell-off’s biggest loser with a 13% drop.
European stocks have tumbled since last month’s record high, with the global policy response so far inspiring little confidence that the fallout from the spreading virus will be contained.
The ECB left its deposit facility rate and its main refinancing rate unchanged, while it added 120 billion euros ($135 billion) of net asset purchases through the end of 2020. Shares of banks nevertheless extended their drop to 12%.
U.S. stocks plunged at the open as President Donald Trump late Wednesday announced a sweeping 30-day ban on travel from Europe excluding the U.K., with the Department of Homeland Security later clarifying that the restriction applies generally to foreigners who’ve been in Europe within 14 days.
Here are further comments from market participants:
Holger Schmieding, Berenberg
“None of the ECB’s measures or any other monetary, fiscal or regulatory policy initiative can be the circuit breaker in the recession into which the eurozone seems to have fallen this month, in our view. But the ECB package, and further steps by bank supervisors as well as by fiscal policy, can limit second-round effects. The ECB today has made it even less likely that the severe Covid-19 shock to the real economy could morph into a financial crisis. The ECB package also raises the hope that, once the medical outlook has become clearer, the Eurozone economy will be in a better position than otherwise to recover from the current severe shock to supply and demand.”Manish Singh, Crossbridge Capital
“It’s not a liquidity problem. This battle is for Merkel to step up and fight, Lagarde is the foot soldier in this coronavirus war. Market needs to see decisive and effective political and fiscal leadership from the EU. Good first step but not enough to lift the mood and change sentiments. We need strong fiscal response. Monetary policy bullet is spent and just a band-aid.”Sebastien Galy, Nordea Investment Funds
“The fact that the ECB didn’t go for more negative interest rates tells you about the complete lack of coordination between the United States and the EU. More negative interest rates are likely seen as a devaluation by the US at the time of heavy trade negotiations and a travel ban.”David Holohan, Mediolanum
“While the initial reaction of banks and broader equities was lower, I suspect bank investors will quickly see that the ECB actions are aimed at supporting banks and their investment cases are improved in light of Temporary Capital and Operational Relief as opposed to lower interest rates.”Thomas Gitzel, VP Bank
“The ECB is trying to do its part to manage the crisis. The deposit rate was not further reduced, but other means are in focus. Small and medium-sized businesses in particular now need access to liquidity. The banking sector cannot help in all cases due to strict regulations. The ECB’s decision to relax regulations for banks’ capital ratios is therefore correct. In addition, however, flanking government special credit programs are now needed.”Neil Birrell, Premier Miton
“The ECB has stepped up to the plate and joined other major central banks with measures to try and stabilise the economic shock being caused by COVID-19. The fact that rates haven’t been cut doesn’t really matter as it wouldn’t have made much difference, but the market will be disappointed by that. It’s all about the liquidity package, which at first glance looks to be the targeted response that was promised.”Phil Smeaton, Sanlam Investments
“So far we have seen numerous easing measures from central banks, but markets have yet to respond positively as we have not yet, outside the UK’s budget yesterday, seen the fiscal response which is expected. The market remains focused on the short term cash flow problems that the economic lock downs will create and debt markets are pricing in a deterioration of credit quality and rise in defaults and downgrades. For companies with strong balance sheets this provides good opportunities for long term investors, and for companies with weak balance sheets they should grab the loans while they can. I expect stronger and more coordinated fiscal measures to be deployed soon.”Uwe Maderer, LBBW Asset Management
“We are at the lower bound and the ECB can’t do much more. I think the package is sensitive and gut as it provides more liquidity and a reduction in capital requirements. Very balanced. Risk assets should now stabilise at this level.”"

Investing.com - European stocks plunged to session lows Thursday as trading on Wall Street was halted again shortly after the open, with investors desperate to get rid of shares.
The Euro Stoxx 50 tumbled 10% in afternoon trading. Germany’s DAX sank 9.8%, the U.K.’s FTSE100 fell 9.2% and France’s CAC shed 10.3%
U.S. stock index futures dove during President Donald Trump’s Oval Office speech late Wednesday, with investors clearly deciding a partial travel ban on European citizens was far from the bold action many hoped would be taken by the U.S. to combat Covid-19 and help stabilize financial markets.
Stocks in the U.S. fell 7% at the opening bell, triggering circuit breakers that halt trading for 15 minutes.
European investors also gave thumbs down to the European Central Bank keeping rates unchanged, although it did increase quantitative easing."
1573,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 12, 2020 09:47AM ET</span>","U.S. Stocks Plunge, Trigger Trading Halt: Markets Wrap","(Bloomberg) --
The rout in global stocks deepened after the U.S. and European policy responses to the worsening spread of the coronavirus rattled investors pining for more. Treasuries and haven currencies rallied.
U.S. equities plunged 7%, triggering a NYSE circuit breaker that halts trading for 15 minutes for the second time this week. Futures also fell 7% and were halted. European stocks tumbled more than 8%. The 10-year Treasury yield slid to 0.65%.
President Donald Trump’s travel ban and tepid fiscal measures sparked the latest leg down in risk assets, while the European Central Bank failed to stem the rout after it left rates unchanged, though it temporarily increased its QE program and took steps to boost liquidity.
On another bruising day across markets:

The S&P 500 headed for a bear market, with losses from its February closing record to 25%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average sank deeper into bear territory after its record bull run ended Wednesday.
The MSCI All-Country World Index extended losses to trade more than 20% below last month’s peak, putting it in on track for the same distinction.
The Stoxx Europe 600 tumbled almost 8%, with most industry sectors down 5% or more and trading volumes more than double the 100-day average. The cost of insuring debt issued by Europe’s investment grade companies surged to the highest since 2016.
Japanese stocks closed more than 4% lower even after another liquidity pledge from the country’s central bank. Australian shares were among the worst performing worldwide, sinking deeper into a bear market despite a stimulus plan there. India’s benchmark fell more than 8%.
Treasury yields resumed their retreat, sliding by almost 20 basis points. Oil extended losses by more than 5%. Bitcoin slumped.

Trump unveiled steps including lending aid for small businesses and asked Congress to pass undefined payroll-tax relief, but his Oval Office address gave the market little confidence that the U.S. is tightening its grip on the virus or its economic impact. The World Health Organization earlier called the outbreak a pandemic and other countries, such as the U.K., have taken more extreme measures to try to blunt the threat to growth.
“Market moves suggest monetary stimulus has reached its limits,” said Lucas Bouwhuis, a portfolio manager at Achmea Investment. “Most of the stimulus needs to come from the fiscal side and we are just not seeing enough of that yet.”
Meanwhile, signs that companies in the hardest-hit industries were drawing down credit lines to battle the effects of the virus on their businesses added to anxiety.
“The market will need much more to get its confidence back,” said Mohit Kumar, managing director at Jefferies International Ltd. “The economic slowdown is because consumers won’t spend as they don’t go out or travel -- you can’t make them spend by giving cheaper money. What you need is fiscal stimulus.”
These are the main moves in markets:

1574,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 12, 2020 09:34AM ET</span>",Stocks - Wall Street Plummets at Open as Trump Blast Triggers Panic,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets fell further into bear market territory at the open on Thursday, after President Donald Trump failed late on Wednesday to provide a detailed package of economic policy stimulus to address the impact of the spreading coronavirus.
By 9:35 AM ET (1335 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 1,729 points or 7.3%. The S&P 500 was down 6.4% and the Nasdaq Composite was down 6.5%.
“The market conclusion would appear to be that the U.S. President’s approach does not represent the clear and coherent economic plan that investors wish to see,” said Paul Donovan, chief economist with UBS Global Wealth Management, in a morning briefing.
Speaking after the market close on Wednesday, Trump had announced a somewhat haphazard cocktail of measures including a ban on foreign nationals arriving from continental Europe, but not from the U.K. and Ireland, a measure that dealt another blow to airline and travel-exposed stocks.
The news also sent U.S. crude oil prices spiralling lower again as markets priced in another big cut to fuel demand from the air and road transportation sectors.
In addition, Trump announced that the April 15 tax deadline would be deferred, giving an effective bridging loan of $200 billion to households and businesses struggling with short-term cash flow issues, but there was no mention of state-subsidized sick pay or of any expansion of testing for the disease within the U.S., despite increasing signs of the virus spreading within the community.
“The further characterization of this as a ‘foreign virus’ seems an unrealistic assessment of the domestic U.S. risks,” Donovan said.
The market was unmoved by the European Central Bank’s decision to increase its quantitative easing program and offer cheap targeted loans to banks for the next year. The ECB kept its key interest rates unchanged.

The Stoxx Europe 600 Index slid 7.4% as of 12:50 p.m. in London, adding to worries about the virus impact after U.S. President Donald Trump’s speech restricting travel from the region had already spooked traders.
The ECB left its deposit facility rate and its main refinancing rate unchanged, while it added 120 billion euros of net asset purchases through the end of 2020. President Christine Lagarde will hold a press conference at 2:30 p.m. CET.
U.S. index futures slid as Trump late Wednesday announced a sweeping 30-day ban on travel from Europe excluding the U.K., with the Department of Homeland Security later clarifying that the restriction applies generally to foreigners who’ve been in Europe within 14 days. Futures on the tech-heavy Nasdaq Index dropped as much as 5% overnight, triggering a limit-down level that doesn’t allow them to fall too much in a particular session.
“Trump undelivered woefully on market expectations and inspired little confidence that the U.S. administration had the situation under control,” said Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets.
European stocks have tumbled since last month’s record high, with the global policy response so far inspiring little confidence that the fallout from the spreading virus will be contained.
All 19 Stoxx 600 industry groups slid 6.4% or more on Thursday. The biggest losers were travel and leisure shares, already the worst hit in the sell-off since worries about the outbreak outside of China gripped markets last month."

LONDON (Reuters) - Global stocks plunged into a bear market and oil slumped on Thursday after U.S. President Donald Trump banned travel from Europe to stem the spread of coronavirus, threatening more disruption to the world economy.
With the pandemic wreaking havoc on the daily life of millions, investors were also disappointed by the lack of broad measures in Trump's plan to fight the virus, prompting traders to bet on further aggressive easing by the U.S. Federal Reserve.
""He (Trump) did not announce any new concrete measures such as a large-scale payroll tax cut to buffer the economy against the impending coronavirus slowdown,"" said Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst at OANDA.
""That has probably disappointed markets more than anything.""
European shares (STOXX) plummeted to their lowest in almost four years, with the benchmark STOXX 600 index falling 6% by midday in London. Travel and leisure stocks shed 9.9%, hitting their lowest in more than six years. (SXTP)
The falls pushed the MSCI All-Country World Index (MIWD00000PUS), which tracks stocks across 49 countries, into bear market territory, down 20% from its 52-week peak.
The index was down over 2% on the day.
Investors also rushed into safe-haven assets, from bonds to gold to the yen and the Swiss franc. Bitcoin plunged 25%, amid wild volatility in cryptocurrency markets.
U.S. S&P 500 futures (ESc1) plummeted as much as 5% in European trading hours, a day after the S&P 500 (SPX) lost 4.89%, leaving the index on the brink of entering bear market territory, defined as a 20% fall from a recent top.
The VIX volatility index (VIX) -- Wall Street's ""fear gauge"" -- and an equivalent measure of volatility for the Euro Stoxx 50 (V2TX) hit their highest levels since the 2008 financial crisis.
Japan's Nikkei (N225) crumbled 4.4% to a trough last seen almost three years ago, while MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan (MIAPJ0000PUS) fell 5%.
Australian shares (AXJO) plunged 7.4% to their lowest level in more than three years while Seoul's Kospi (KS11) fell 4.8% to 4-1/2-year lows, with massive selling prompting a brief trade halt. Thai shares (SETI) sank 10.8% to eight-year lows.
Trump announced on Wednesday the United States will suspend all travel from Europe, except the United Kingdom and Ireland, to the United States for 30 days starting on Friday. He said trade will not be affected by the restrictions.
Trump also announced some other steps, including instructing the Treasury Department to defer tax payments for entities hit by the virus.
""The travel ban from Europe has definitely taken everyone by surprise,"" said Khoon Goh, head of Asia Research at ANZ in Singapore.
""Already we know the economic impact is significant, and with this additional measure on top it's just going to multiply the impact across businesses. This is something that markets had not factored in ... it's a huge near-term economic cost.""
In the money market, traders further raised expectations of another U.S. rate cut, even after the Fed's emergency cut last week.
Fed fund rate futures are now pricing in a large possibility of a 1.0 percentage point cut, rather than 0.75, at a policy review on March 17-18.
PANDEMIC
The World Health Organization (WHO) described the outbreak as a pandemic for the first time on Wednesday.
The highly infectious coronavirus that shut down most of China for much of February is spreading rapidly in Europe and increasingly in the United States, disrupting many corners of life from education to sports, entertainment and dining.
Investors worry how much of an effect policies can have in turning around the global economy given the restrictions on daily life, travel and business.
A case in point was Britain, where the FTSE stock index (FTSE) hit near four-year lows on Wednesday as investors doubted whether the $39 billion government spending plan and 0.5 percentage point Bank of England rate cut announced on Wednesday would be enough to counter the shock from the outbreak.
The index fell even further on Thursday, down 5.75%.
The British pound last stood at $1.2722 , down 0.6% on the day.
Gold fell 0.6% to $1,624.16 per ounce but still stood well below Monday's high above $1,700.
The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield fell to 0.6861% (US10YT=RR) -- still above a record low of 0.318% touched on Monday. The two-year yield (US2YT=RR) fell to 0.3898%, but stood well above Monday's low of 0.251%.
In commodities, oil prices were also hit, compounded by an intensifying price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia, on top of fears of a sharp slowdown in the global economy.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude (CLc1) shed 6.06% to $30.98 per barrel. Brent crude fell 6.5% to $33.46. (LCoc1)
Copper, seen as a gauge of global economic health because of its wide industrial use, fell to over three-year lows. [MET/L]
In the currency market, the dollar slid against the safe-haven yen and Swiss franc.
The U.S. currency fell 0.89% to 103.60 yen and lost 0.14% to 0.9366 francs .
The euro traded at $1.1243 (EUR=), down 0.2% ahead of the European Central Bank's policy meeting later in the day.
The ECB is all but certain to unveil new stimulus measures, including new, ultra-cheap loans for banks to pass on to small and medium-sized firms."
1587,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 12, 2020 08:23AM ET</span>",Corporate credit risk heightens as coronavirus impact spreads,"By Megan Davies and Kate Duguid
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investor worries about corporate credit are heating up as the coronavirus spreads, with the prices of bond funds taking a hit, companies starting to draw on credit lines and some market watchers warning of the possibility that investors pull out of products. 
Investors are growing increasingly concerned that the coronavirus outbreak will hit U.S. corporate cash flow if it keeps workers at home or prevents companies from paying employees.
""The problem for this cycle in corporate credit risk is that's where you had the greatest excess - where you had the biggest build-up in leverage, the biggest deterioration in underwriting standards,"" said Troy Gayeski, co-chief investment officer of SkyBridge, an alternative investments firm. ""When you have a growth shock like we are clearly having, then the more vulnerable areas of the economy have less ability to manage their balance sheets.” 
Closed-end high-yield bond funds fell on Wednesday - some by nearly twice as much as the broader high-yield market - as investors wary of risk pulled out of the leveraged products.
""There are asset managers that hold relatively illiquid assets like high-yield bonds or loans, and the risk is that the investors in those asset managers might decide to redeem their shares quickly,"" Tobias Adrian, director of the International Monetary Fund's Monetary and Capital Markets Department, said in an interview. 
The worry was at the riskier end of the fixed-income space, including high-yield bonds, leveraged loans and emerging markets debt, Adrian said.
Zoltan Pozsar at  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) wrote in a research note last week of the risk that many corporations draw on their credit lines at the same time, and what could be an idiosyncratic shock becomes systemic.
The underlying funding mechanics of such a massive liquidity call could be ""overwhelming for the repo and FX swap markets,"" Pozsar wrote. 
Higher demand for dollar funding has investors on guard for the kinds of money market stresses that tend to exacerbate cross-border financial crises.
Among corporations that are feeling the strain is  Boeing Co  (N:BA), which is planning to draw down the rest of a $13.8 billion loan it agreed last month, a source told Reuters on Wednesday.
Bloomberg reported that Hilton Worldwide plans to draw down a portion of its $1.75 billion loan. Hilton did not respond to a Reuters request for comment. 
Bloomberg also reported that private equity firm Blackstone Group Inc (N:BX) is asking companies it controls to draw down their credit lines, citing people familiar with the matter. 
Blackstone said in a statement: “There is no firmwide directive to our portfolio companies to draw upon credit lines. We are evaluating the financing needs of certain companies directly impacted by COVID-19.”
""The fact that Hilton and Boeing are drawing on credit lines is indicative of poor sales, and we look for credit spreads to blow out, especially in the BBB- or lower credits,"" said John Lekas, chief executive and senior portfolio manager at Leader Capital. 
Junk bonds are pricing in a higher level of default and spreads over safer Treasuries widened this week to levels not seen since 2016, using the ICE/BofA high yield index. 
An index for credit insurance protecting against exposure to junk bonds  - widely used as a gauge of sentiment about high-yield debt - surged as insurance costs mounted on Monday to the highest level since February 2016. It has since come off those highs, though spreads were trading slightly wider on Wednesday. 
Boeing's credit default swap  jumped to an all-time high after news of the drawdown. 
The spread between one-day commercial paper rate for high-grade AA non-financial borrowers versus the next tier down - where Boeing sits - is the highest in about two years. 
(Graphic: Commercial paper - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/3254/3215/Pasted%20Image.jpg) 
S&P said it did not believe that Boeing drew on the facility because it had an immediate need for the cash, ""but to just have it in the bank in case the current market disruptions for some reason made it difficult for them to access it in the future.""
That would not cause a change in the rating, S&P said.
David Erickson, a senior fellow and lecturer at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School who previously worked on Wall Street in equity capital markets with Lehman Brothers and  Barclays  (LON:BARC), compared the situation to late-2008 when ""given the uncertainty of the time we were in at that time, a lot of companies that needed access to liquidity drew down the banks lines.""

Trump announced on Wednesday the U.S. will suspend all travel from Europe, except from the U.K. and Ireland, for 30 days starting on Friday. However, he tweeted that trade will not be affected by the restrictions, contradicting earlier remarks made during his televised address.
He also announced some other steps, including instructing the Treasury Department to defer tax payments for individuals and businesses hit by the virus, but hopes for a massive stimulus package were dashed.
The president also continued to downplay the severity of the virus, insisting the risk was “very, very low” for most Americans.
The World Health Organization (WHO) described the outbreak as a pandemic for the first time earlier on Wednesday.
Investors worry how much of an effect policy can have in turning around the global economy given the restrictions on daily life, travel and business.
Trump’s appearance came just hours after the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged into bear market territory, defined as a 20% fall from a recent high.
In the money market, traders further raised expectations of another U.S. rate cut, even after the Fed's emergency cut last week. Fed fund rate futures are now pricing in a large possibility of a 1.0% cut, rather than 0.75%, at the Fed’s upcoming meeting next week.
The European Central Bank is all but certain to unveil new stimulus measures at its meeting later in the day, pushing policy closer to its limits to help cushion the economic blow of the pandemic.
Safe-haven assets were in high demand, with the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield falling to 0.69%, still holding above a record low of 0.32% touched on Monday.

Gold was trading at $1,639.15 per ounce, still well below Monday's high above $1,700.

1590,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 12, 2020 06:36AM ET</span>","RBC Cuts S&P 500 Target, Seeing ‘Flat or Lost Year’ on Virus","(Bloomberg) -- RBC Capital Markets has taken its first stab at accounting for the impact of the coronavirus in its expectations for U.S. stocks, paring back its targets as a result.
The S&P 500 is now expected to end the year at 3,279, versus a prior forecast of 3,400, according to strategist Lori Calvasina. Full-year earnings per share will be $165, she predicted, from a prior $174. She is also shifting to neutral on growth-versus-value, from a prior bias toward value, upgrading health care to overweight from market-weight and downgrading financials to market-weight from overweight.
This will be “a flat or lost year for the index,” Calvasina wrote in a note Thursday. “The brunt of the pain that the U.S. equity market will experience due to the coronavirus will occur early in the year, with the bulk of the economic impact coming mid-year, and a recovery trade taking hold once the news flow around the coronavirus improve and/or the valuation appeal of stocks becomes more clear.”
Calvasina isn’t the only strategist reassessing in light of the coronavirus-induced market meltdown.  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Group AG’s Jonathan Golub lowered his year-end target to 3,300 from 3,600;  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS).’s David Kostin cut his to 3,200 and called for an end to the bull market.  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) SA’s Sophie Huynh now has hers at 3,500 -- but sees the lion’s share of the rally later in the year after the gauge languishes for some time due to the current uncertainty.
Going forward, Calvasina said she’s watching for evidence of investor capitulation, a “necessary though not sufficient condition” for a bottom. In terms of key downside levels, if investors price in a recession, the S&P 500 could fall to around its December 2018 low of 2,351, she said. If the gauge’s price-to-earnings ratio drops to the December 2018 trough of 14.4, the index would be at 2,381, she said.
“The median and average drop in the S&P 500 associated with recessions dating back to the 1930s has been 24% and 32%, which would take the S&P 500 down into the 2300-2600 range,” Calvasina wrote. However, she added that “we think it’s important to keep in mind that the recessionary drawdowns of the Financial Crisis and Tech bubble were more extreme than the historical norm, and we do not see the same kinds of excesses today.”"

The cost to insure against defaults of Europe’s riskiest companies surged to the highest since 2012 and spreads on euro investment-grade bonds widened, adding to a 50% surge this week. Borrowing costs in Asia’s dollar bond market also rose overnight.
Spreads on euro bonds of high quality corporate borrowers have climbed 30 basis points this week to 158, the highest for more than a year, according to a Bloomberg  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Index. The gauge saw its biggest one-day spike since 2001 on Monday, when it leapt nearly 25%.
The U.S. announcement of scattered stimulus measures and restrictions on travel from Europe followed the World Health Organization’s declaration that it now regards the outbreak as a pandemic.
Investors are now waiting to see whether the European Central Bank will follow the lead of the U.K. and announce a hefty economic stimulus package.

“The issue for markets is that as you move from a ‘containment’ effort to a delay effort in order for health systems to stay functional, you simply prolong the economic pain that stems from widespread social distancing,” said Gerry Fowler, global multi-asset strategist at Aberdeen Standard Investments.
ECB Eyed
The ECB is set to unveil its monetary response to the crisis today and it is expected that central bank president Christine Lagarde will seek to prevent the virus from sparking a repeat of the 2008 financial crisis. She has already effectively pre-committed to action this week when she told European leaders that the region risks an economic shock similar to the global financial crisis unless urgent action is taken.
“This is not the time for the ECB to be tinkering around the edges with a paltry move,” said Suki Mann, founder of Creditmarketdaily.com. “A combined fiscal and monetary package will be well received.”
Debt-laden global companies are facing a two-pronged assault from the coronavirus threatening profits just as the cost of rolling over borrowings soars. Firms from Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co. to Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. are preparing to draw down billions of dollars in loans as they grapple with the impact of the pandemic.

There are no new bond sales being offered in Europe on Thursday, leaving sales for the week so far at little over 4 billion euros ($4.5 billion) from just four offerings. There were no new dollar-denominated sales in Asia overnight.

1592,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 12, 2020 05:42AM ET</span>",StockBeat - Trump's Travel Ban Deals Another Crushing Blow to Europe Markets,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- Europe’s stock markets were on course for another day of catastrophic losses on Thursday after U.S. President Donald Trump announced a 30-day ban on accepting flights from Europe, another devastating blow to a battered travel sector, and one that raises the risk of a recession on both sides of the Atlantic.
Selling was, as usual, worst in the most directly affected sectors, and again it was those with the weakest finances that suffered most.
That said, the market wasn’t much kinder even to those with stronger balance sheets. The sharp gap down forced investors to sell what they could. As such, even balance sheet stalwarts like Nestle (SIX:NESN) and Novartis (NYSE:NVS) were down 5.3% and 6.2%, respectively. Energy supplier RWE (MI:RWE), which had been a relative haven for German investors, also finally capitulated, falling 9.4%.
By 5:40 AM ET (0940 GMT), the benchmark Stoxx 600 was down 6.2% at 312.52, its lowest since September 2013. The German DAX was down 6.7%, below 10,000 points, while the U.K. FTSE 100 was down 5.7%.
Among the biggest losers was Cineworld (LON:CINE) shares, which fell 34% after it admitted that it could breach its debt covenants if things turn really bad this year.
“Under the specific downside scenario…of the Group losing the equivalent of between two and three months' total  revenue across the entire estate there is a risk of breaching the Group's financial covenants, unless a waiver agreement is reached with the required majority of lenders.”
The movie theater operator borrowed heavily to finance acquisitions over the last two years, aiming to improve its competitive heft vis-à-vis AMC. It now faces months of sharply-reduced revenue, as consumers stay home rather than risk infection.
Norwegian Air Shuttle  (OL:NWC) shares also fell another 16% as Trump’s travel ban stopped a further vital source of revenue for the struggling airline, while upstream oil specialist  Tullow Oil  's  (LON:TLW) shares fell another 12.7% after it warned that it wouldn’t generate any cash this year below an average oil price of $45 a barrel.
Tullow also slashed its capital spending forecast by 30% to $350 million and said it had available liquidity of $700 million. 
A quieter, but nonetheless more ominous, warning came from FTSE-listed middle eastern hospital operator NMC Health (LON:NMC). It admitted on Thursday that independent investigators appointed to look into its finances had found “evidence leading to suspected fraudulent behaviour in relation to some elements of NMC's previous financial activities.”
The company, which had previously described reports detailing apparent irregularities in its accounts as “malicious” inventions, had announced last week that it had discovered nearly $3 billion in debt that it. NMC’s shares are already suspended from trading but the last two announcements appear to raise the risk that existing shareholders may be wiped out."

The bank, which now rates Boeing ""neutral"", said the added hit from the coronavirus to airlines made it impossible to stick with its call that investors should wait out the grounding of the company's 737 MAX planes this year.
Boeing said on Wednesday it was freezing new hiring and overtime except in certain critical areas to preserve cash, and the company is also moving to draw down funds from existing loan facilities as it battles the worst crisis in its history.
""Our desire to hang in with Boeing until the return of the 737 MAX has worked out poorly, both regarding the timeline for re-certification and now more importantly with the impact of COVID-19 on aircraft demand,"" JPM analyst Seth M. Seifman said.
He said he still expects Boeing to be able to wade through the stressful time for airlines as well as manage its own balance sheet. His price target, while now Wall St's lowest and $140 below the median of all major analysts, was still $21 above Wednesday's closing prices.
Boeing shares fell 18% on Wednesday and are down 58% since the second of two fatal MAX crashes last March."

HONG KONG/BEIJING (Reuters) - Chinese non-life insurers are discovering a silver lining to the cloud spreading over China's economic performance from the coronavirus outbreak - a sharp drop in car accident claims.
Beijing's efforts to contain the new coronavirus have included widespread travel and quarantine restrictions across the country and although these are now being lifted, the loss of economic and social activity meant there were few cars on the road in late January and February.
""There's certainly a decline in auto insurance claims and the settlement ratio due to less traffic and activity amid the virus outbreak,"" said a senior Beijing-based executive at  China Pacific  Insurance Group Co Ltd (SS:601601).
A senior PICC executive based in Ningbo in China's northeast Zhejiang province, the second worst-hit by the virus outbreak, said he expected auto insurance claims and settlements to drop in the first quarter in his city.
The executives declined to be identified as they were not authorised to speak to the media. Representatives for China Pacific Insurance and PICC did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Such is the expected drop in motor accident claims, several brokers have raised target share prices for the likes of PICC Property and Casualty Co Ltd (HK:2328) and  ZhongAn Online  P & C Insurance Co Ltd (HK:6060).
Motor insurance accounts for about three quarters of Chinese non-life insurers' business while health insurance - where virus-related claims would fall under - accounts for less than 5%, according to Swiss Re.
In contrast, for the non-life insurance sector globally, motor and health insurance each account for about a third of premiums.
While the insurance executives predicted claims from buses, trucks and taxis would rebound as people returned to work in China, brokers still expect the virus-related drop in claims will be enough to boost full-year earnings despite a slowing economy.
ZhongAn's mean target price this month has been raised to HK$26.84, up from HK$24.22 in January, according to a Refinitiv poll of 15 brokerages.
Nomura analysts also lifted their PICC target share price last week by 0.7%. Shares in PICC, the biggest non-life insurer in China, have fallen 15% since the Lunar New Year break, compared to a 12% fall for a broader gauge of Chinese stocks in Hong Kong (HSCI)."
1595,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 12, 2020 04:45AM ET</span>",Cineworld could breach debt terms in worst case virus scenario,"LONDON (Reuters) - British cinema operator Cineworld (L:CINE) said on Thursday it could breach the terms of its existing debt arrangements under a worst case scenario for the impact of the coronavirus over the next few months, sending its shares down 20%.
The company, whose biggest shareholder sold a part of Cineworld's stake last week to refinance debt, has been grappling with worries about the potential impact of the coronavirus on box office attendance as the epidemic shows no signs of slowing.
The company said the downside scenario, in which it would close all cinemas for between one and three months, was currently considered unlikely but ""would indicate the existence of a material uncertainty which may cast significant doubt about the Group's ability to continue as a going concern.""
The company said the analysis did not take account of the fact that in case of widespread site closures, films scheduled to be released during this period could be moved to later in 2020.
Cineworld is saddled with $3.5 billion in debt, excluding leases, as it begins to pay for its takeover of Canadian chain Cineplex (TO:CGX). 
It reiterated that it had not yet seen any material impact on its movie theatre admissions from the outbreak, but the company still faced the possibility of fewer movie-goers from the delay of the new James Bond film. 

Analysts at brokerage Jefferies had previously estimated that the company was burning around $115 million monthly and had $470 million in readily available cash and could deal with four months of the unlikely scenario of all cinemas being closed completely.

1601,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 12, 2020 02:54AM ET</span>","Seeking to avoid EU tariffs, Washington state House passes bill to drop Boeing tax break","By Eric M. Johnson
SEATTLE (Reuters) - Washington state's House of Representatives passed a measure on Wednesday night that removes a key tax break for  Boeing Co  (N:BA) and other aerospace firms, in a bid to head off possible European tariffs on U.S. goods and ease a transatlantic trade dispute over aircraft subsidies.
""This measure is important to protect our state's economy,"" House Democratic Majority Leader Pat Sullivan said by phone. ""We don't want tariffs levied by the European Union on the aerospace industry but also on other key industries in the state like wine and agricultural products.""
The measure passed 73-24 after winning approval on Tuesday in the Senate, a spokeswoman for House Democrats said.
However, late changes to the legislation means it must be put to another vote in the Senate before it can go to Washington state Governor Jay Inslee's desk for signing.
The World Trade Organization has found that Boeing and Europe's Airbus (PA:AIR), the world's two largest planemakers, received billions of dollars of unfair subsidies in cases dating back to 2004. The global trade body has faulted both sides for failing to comply fully with previous rulings, opening the door to a tariff war.
After years of debate, the focus of the European case against the United States involves a preferential state tax rate for aerospace introduced 16 years ago and renewed in 2013 to help attract production work for Boeing's 777X.
The planned law changes would remove the 40% saving on Business and Occupation tax, which saved Boeing some $118 million in 2018 based on published jetliner revenues.
""We applaud the House for its commitment to full WTO compliance,"" a Boeing spokesman said by email on Wednesday evening. ""We support this legislation and look forward to the Senate concurrence vote.""
The United States in February toughened its own tariffs on aircraft built by Boeing's arch-rival Airbus after winning approval last year from the WTO to penalize European goods over Airbus subsidies.
The European Union is widely expected to win approval to use a similar trade weapon to penalize imports of U.S. goods when a parallel case over U.S. support for Boeing comes to a head during the spring.

Makers of products ranging from luxury goods to whisky have raised concerns over the impact of a tit-for-tat tariff war spreading beyond the aerospace industry.

1603,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 12, 2020 01:26AM ET</span>",Virus volatility a shot in the arm for China's dormant derivatives market,"By Samuel Shen and Andrew Galbraith
SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Trading in China's equity derivatives has hit a five-year high, with some products seeing record volume, in a sudden comeback for a market considered essential in other major economies but shunned in China following a crash in 2015.
Panic about the economic impact of the coronavirus outbreak and a huge drop in oil prices has sparked extreme market volatility, encouraging investors to find ways of hedging risk with products such as stock index futures and equity options.
Trading in stock index futures has hit its highest since the end of 2015 with nearly $70 billion worth of contracts changing hands each day, while stock option trading has set records with the number of open contracts exceeding 5 million on the Shanghai Stock Exchange.
Futures based on the small-cap CSI 500 index (CICc1) are especially hot, with the daily volume of traded contracts since the market reopened in February following the Lunar New Year holiday more than doubling from the same period a year earlier.
""The entire market is panic everywhere,"" said Hong Kong-based portfolio manager Yun Xiong at Green Harmony Capital. ""This market definitely increased the importance of derivatives in China as hedging tools. We see good growth in this field.""
A futures contract allows an investor to buy or sell an asset such as stock at a predetermined price and at a specific time. An options contract gives the investor the right, but not the obligation, to trade an asset at a stated price within a specified period.
Trading in such products, however, has been restricted since the securities regulator partly blamed them for a stock market crash in 2015. Two years later, China's broader financial market deregulation saw those restrictions ease - including loosening trading limits on futures contracts whose prices are derived from stock indexes.
China's stock market is dominated by quick-trading retail investors and so typically experiences big price swings. However, such swings are being exacerbated by uncertainty surrounding the virus, which originated in China where the government closed businesses to slow its spread.
""Emotional"" investors are pushing prices ""too far in one direction or the other"", said Phillip Wool, Managing Director of Rayliant Global Advisors.
For instance, tech board ChiNext (CNT) experienced a 31% swing last month, compared with 19% in U.S. counterpart Nasdaq. Such volatility is encouraging investors to defend against daily swings by hedging spot trading with futures and options.
COMPETITION
The securities regulator has been slowly easing rules in China's derivatives market, weighing what it has said is distrust of speculation purely to make a quick profit, against a desire to attract foreign investors who regard derivatives a normal part of their toolkit to mitigate risk.
At the same time, the market is widely expected to become increasingly important to the competitiveness of local brokerages, who face the inevitable arrival of more experienced foreign finance houses.
Under the Sino-U.S. trade agreement signed in January, foreign brokerages and mutual fund managers can apply to own 100% of their Chinese operations from April 1, from 51% at present. Ownership caps for foreign futures firms were scrapped in January.
Chen Hongting, head of options at trading consultancy AlgoStar, said China was beginning to realize that a vibrant derivatives market could help the real economy by providing much-needed risk-mitigating tools.
""Regulators naturally don't like speculation,"" said Chen, whose clients include both those trading to hedge risk, and those speculating for swift gains.
""But if some people want to avert risk, there have to be other people willing to take on that risk - and those people are speculators."""

Investing.com - Softbank Group Corp. (T:9984)’s CEO Masayoshi Son said he is reconsidering his earlier proposal of free virus testing as his offer drew criticism. 
 
Son proposed earlier this week to provide 1 million free home tests for COVID-19 as he was “worried about the situation” and that many people were not able to test if they were infected. 
 
However, he withdrew the plan merely hours later amid concerns that the Japanese health care system could be overwhelmed by such a huge influx of people with light symptoms.
 
One comment on Son’s Twitter feed pointed out that the tests involved are way too complicated, as they require the users to take a swab from deep in the nasal cavity and that a deluge of useless samples would actually impede detection.
 
“I started the plan because I heard that many people couldn’t take the tests even if they want to,” he said.
 
SoftBank’s shares dropped 4.7% to 4,040 yen by 12:05 AM ET (04:05 GMT).

(Reuters) - Canada's  Bombardier Inc  (TO:BBDb) said late Wednesday Chief Executive Officer Alain Bellemare would step down and be replaced by former company executive and Hydro-Quebec CEO Eric Martel.
Bellemare, who took over the top job at Bombardier in 2015, has steered the company through some of its biggest challenges, including a brush with bankruptcy due to its costly C Series jet program.
Under his watch, the company has narrowed its focus on making business jets, after offloading its stake in the A220 passenger jet program - formerly known as the C Series - to Airbus SE (PA:AIR) and selling the rail division to France's  Alstom  SA (PA:ALSO) earlier this year.
""With the five-year turnaround plan nearing completion, the board, including Mr. Bellemare, unanimously concluded that it was the appropriate time for a new leader to take the helm of the corporation,"" Bombardier said in a statement.

Martel had worked with Bombardier for 13 years and was the president of its business aircraft unit before joining the hydropower producer as CEO in 2015.

Rio Tinto's board and Walsh agreed to defer incentive payments from Walsh's time as chief executive in 2017 while regulators in the United Kingdom investigated payments to a consultant in relation to a Rio iron ore project in Guinea when Walsh was the head of Rio's iron ore group.
Rio sought to continue to defer payments owed to Walsh on Dec. 31, 2018, while investigation continued, though the two sides could not agree on a deferment.
The dispute resolution process determined that under the initial deferment deed Walsh's payments should not be held up any longer, Rio said in a statement.
""Payments will be made by Rio Tinto to Sam Walsh of all deferred incentive plan awards which would have been payable on 31 December 2018 together with associated dividends and interest,"" it said.
In a separate statement, Walsh said Rio will pay him A$6.8 million ($4.40 million) related to a portion of his long- and short-term incentive awards, plus interest. Two more payments are still to be made, one in December 2020 and another in May 2021.
The payments scandal related to $10.5 million in payments to a consultant linked to the Simandou iron ore project in West Africa when Walsh headed the iron ore division in 2011.
Rio became aware of emails relating to the payments and self reported to regulators in 2016 after which the UK's Serious Fraud Office opened up an investigation.
Sam Walsh helmed the iron ore giant from 2013 to 2016."

Icahn, who held a roughly 2.5% stake in Occidental as of end-2019, has previously criticized its $38 billion deal for rival Anadarko Petroleum (NYSE:APC) as a misplaced bet on oil prices rising, and has promised a proxy fight to win control of the company. 
Oil prices have plunged more than 40% this year, straddling Occidental with a debt pile of about $40 billion from the Anadarko deal. 
The Houston-based company on Tuesday slashed its dividend and announced cost cutting measures to allay investor concerns over profitability, saying the cuts would help it finance expenses, with oil hovering near the $30-a-barrel range.
Shares of Occidental closed about 18% lower on Wednesday and have plunged 71.4% this year, as of the previous close. 
Icahn, who has been pushing the company to consider putting itself up for sale, is seeking to replace Occidental's entire board, the WSJ report said. 
Occidental's other large shareholders, including T.

1610,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 11, 2020 07:50PM ET</span>","As S&P 500 selloff approaches 20%, what next?","By Noel Randewich
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Fear about the coronavirus has pulled the S&P 500 down nearly 20% from its record high. So what? 
For many investors, Wall Street's recent deep losses are marking the end of the longest S&P 500 bull market on record, and their question now is, how deeply will a new bear market fall before recovering? 
Following three weeks of volatility on Wall Street, the S&P 500 (SPX) will be confirmed to be in a bear market - by a traditional definition - if the benchmark extends its decline to 20%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) on Wednesday tumbled 5.86%, bringing its loss from its Feb 12 high to 20.30%, confirming it has entered a bear market. The S&P 500 fell 4.89%, extending the loss from its Feb 19 record high to 19.04% for the first time.
The Nasdaq dropped 4.70% and is now down 19.0% from its high, also on Feb 19. 
The latest investor pessimism came after the World Health Organization classified the coronavirus outbreak as a pandemic, and after Reuters reported that the White House had ordered top-level coronavirus meetings to be classified.
Further deep declines on Wall Street may depend on whether the health crisis pushes the U.S. economy into its first recession in over a decade.
(Graphic: Bear markets and recessions - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/3253/3214/Bear%20markets.png)
Many investors generally consider a bear market to be marked by a 20% drop in a security or benchmark from a major high, a development often accompanied by long-term pessimism and more declines. By that measure, the S&P 500 has experienced eight bear markets since the 1960s, according to Yardeni Research. 
However, strategists warn the arbitrary 20% definition of a bear market is more useful for examining history than for making predictions in the midst of a dramatic selloff. A 20% decline in and of itself does not necessarily mean things are about to get even worse.
""A 20% drop is somewhat arbitrary. It's useful for bucketing things so that historians can go back and label environments. But it's not really useful in the here and now,"" said Willie Delwiche, an investment strategist at Robert W. Baird. Delwiche is counseling his clients not to panic about the recent volatility.
Factors like the speed of the market's decline, how much average stocks have suffered, and the reasons behind the selloff also contribute to whether investors view a deep downturn as a turning point in sentiment or a short-term interruption in a long-term bull market. Historically, more intense bear markets have been accompanied by recessions.
For example, the S&P 500's 15-day selloff from its record highs to its current level has been the fastest since 2009, according to Refinitiv data. 
Less than three months into 2020, the S&P 500 has already seen 11 days of declines of greater than 1%, compared to 15 such days in all of 2019. (For a graphic showing recent market volatility, click here)
(Graphic: Volatility is back on Wall Street - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/3235/3196/Pasted%20Image.jpg)
Delwiche said he views market slumps in 2011 and 2018 as bear markets, based on the intensity of those declines, even though the S&P 500 fell less than 20%.
Since the S&P 500 hit a record high on Feb 19, the median change of its components has been a drop of almost 21%. Stocks down that amount include Alphabet (O:GOOGL) and  Universal Health Services  Inc (N:UHS). 
Bear markets that coincided with U.S. recessions saw 37% declines in the S&P 500 on average, before bottoming out, while bear markets unrelated to recessions on average brought falls of 24%, according to LPL Financial. 
In an analysis of bear markets, LPL included selloffs that fell just short of 20%. Overall, seven out of 15 selloffs on its list, going back to 1946, were accompanied by recessions.
Strong U.S. February employment data and other recent economic indicators likely do not capture the impact of the coronavirus, leaving financial markets and economists to anticipate severe economic disruptions in the months ahead. Many economists believe the virus, which causes a flu-like illness, may be the catalyst that interrupts the longest economic expansion on record, now in its 11th year. In that case, the stock market could continue to decline.
""If China truly has seen its coronavirus cases stabilize, if we see something similar, this could be a fairly short-lived bear market,"" said Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel in Charlottesville, Virginia. ""If we do not see that, this could last for many months.""
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) said on Wednesday the S&P 500 bull market is likely to end soon, forecasting a 28% slump from its February peak as the coronavirus takes a toll on corporate profits.

""We're aware that the forward data is going to fall off a cliff, with the coronavirus taking hold,"" said LPL Financial senior market strategist Ryan Detrick. ""But we don't think the end of the world is coming and that the coronavirus will have a lasting effect on the economy.""

1611,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 11, 2020 06:37PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Boeing to separate 737 MAX wire bundles before jet's return to service - sources,"By Eric M. Johnson and David Shepardson
SEATTLE/WASHINGTON (Reuters) -  Boeing Co  (N:BA) plans to separate 737 MAX wiring bundles, flagged by regulators as potentially dangerous, before the jet returns to service, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters on Wednesday.
The decision to change clusters of wiring that control key aircraft systems marks a reversal from the U.S. planemaker's initial recommendation to the Federal Aviation Administration and poses a fresh hurdle to the jet's already-delayed return to service.
The FAA and Boeing first said in early January they were reviewing a wiring issue that could potentially cause a short circuit on the 737 MAX, and in certain remote circumstances lead to a crash if pilots did not react in time.
Earlier on Wednesday, FAA chief Steve Dickson confirmed that the agency had rejected Boeing's initial proposal to leave wiring bundles in place and said the decision on next steps was up to the planemaker.
Pending final approvals from the FAA, Boeing will move to physically separate the wiring bundles before the MAX is cleared for service, two people familiar with the matter said. 
Boeing does not view the retrofits as delaying the plane's estimated return to service in the middle of the year at the earliest, one of the people added. Boeing expects changes to take roughly one week per aircraft, but it will do some of the work as it goes through the process of removing aircraft from storage, he said.
Representatives for Boeing and FAA declined to comment on whether the planemaker intends to separate the wiring bundles. 
Boeing has noted in talks with the FAA that the same wiring bundles are in the 737 NG, which has been in service since 1997 and logged 205 million flight hours without any wiring issues.
Boeing's 737 MAX was grounded worldwide a year ago after two crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia killed 346 people within five months.
The worldwide safety ban wiped billions off the company's value and sparked hundreds of lawsuits from bereaved families.
Boeing has spent months updating the stall-prevention software known as MCAS linked to both crashes, but fresh issues have surfaced during intense scrutiny on the aircraft, pushing back regulators' re-approval of the plane by months. 
Wiring was one such issue. 
There are more than a dozen different locations on the 737 MAX where wiring bundles may be too close together. Most of the locations are under the cockpit in an electrical bay.
Boeing was already weeks into developing a backup plan in case the FAA rejected its arguments, the people said.

1614,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 11, 2020 06:13PM ET</span>","Coronavirus raises fears of U.S. auto sales slowdown, but production not suffering yet","By Ben Klayman
DETROIT (Reuters) - Fears of a U.S. sales slowdown in auto showrooms due to the coronavirus outbreak that has spread globally are appearing in analysts' forecasts, but industry executives said the pandemic has yet to affect demand or factory production.
Officials with Detroit automakers General Motors Co (N:GM),  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) and  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles NV (MI:FCHA) (N:FCAU) on Wednesday said there has been no disruption to U.S. production. 
Automakers and their suppliers have avoided shutdowns in the United States so far due to parts already en route, as well as suppliers resorting to air shipments or resourcing the supply of parts to different plants, supplier executives and industry consultants said.
GM Chief Executive Mary Barra said last week the No. 1 U.S. automaker's vehicle production was secure from parts shortages ""quite far into this month."" Suppliers and industry consultants contacted by Reuters echoed that there should be no issues through at least the end of the month. 
The coronavirus outbreak, which originated in China last year and causes the sometimes deadly respiratory illness COVID-19, has killed more than 4,300 globally and been reported in about 120 countries.
In Wednesday trading, shares of GM and Ford fell 4.1% and 5.5%, respectively, on a day when the broad S&P 500 Index (SPX) fell nearly 5%.
Kalitta Air, an international air cargo carrier in Michigan that counts auto companies among its clients, is operating its planes 25% more than usual due to heavier demand from customers and the near-term schedule is filled, said Chief Operating Officer Pete Sanderlin. ""We're booking business towards the end of April.""
Suppliers echo that sentiment.
""Dana hasn’t had any significant interruptions up to this point, and we have 149 facilities globally,"" Dana Inc (N:DAN) CEO James Kamsickas said in an email statement. 
However, that situation could change quickly for suppliers and their customers, said Dan Hearsch, managing director in the auto practice for consultancy AlixPartners.
""You need all 9,000 parts that go into a car. If you only have 8,998 of them, you're got a problem. You can't make the car,"" he said. 
Meanwhile, analysts are reducing their 2020 sales forecasts for the U.S. market due to the outbreak.
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analyst Adam Jonas said on Wednesday in a research note he expects the outbreak to send U.S. auto sales down 9% this year as ""demand shock"" causes consumers to delay large purchases. Before the outbreak, he had expected a decline of 1-2%. 
Jonas cut price targets on GM and Ford, as well as on publicly traded dealer groups AutoNation Inc (N:AN),  Lithia Motors Inc  (N:LAD),  Sonic Automotive Inc  (N:SAH) and  Group 1 Automotive Inc  (N:GPI). He also trimmed his 2020 profit forecasts for GM and Ford. 
However, auto dealers from across the United States said last week it was business as usual with strong customer traffic in their showrooms, and the situation had not changed so far this week. 
""Thankfully, we are well. Nothing has changed with our dealers with respect to the coronavirus,"" Evelyn Cardenas, CEO of the Central Florida Auto Dealers Association in the Orlando area said on Tuesday. Those sentiments were echoed by the National Automobile Dealers Association.
While sales data from J.D. Power for the first full week of March showed a decline of about 10%, a drop was expected and was not attributable to the epidemic, said Tyson Jominy, a vice president at the research firm.
But where the coronavirus has hit hardest, the pain has been felt, as auto sales last week slid 20% in Seattle - a region badly affected, he added. New York, another state with a high number of infections, has not been hurt yet. 
Automakers are due to report first-quarter sales in early April.

1615,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 11, 2020 06:03PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch for March 12,"By Kim Khan
Investing.com - As the World Health Organization officially declared Covid-19 a pandemic, the Dow officially closed in bear market territory, down 20% from recent highs.
There was late buying to support the broader market slightly today, but there’s little doubt now stocks will keep sliding until investors can really get their arms around how much impact this disease will have.
That means virus-related headlines will be setting the tone of trading again, which are coming apace. Less than an hour after the close of trading Italy announced it would be closing all shops except groceries and pharmacies. In the U.S., the NCAA announced its March Madness basketball tournament would be played without spectators.


Here are three things that could move the markets tomorrow.
1. Trump Set to Speak
President Donald Trump will address the nation from the Oval Office about Covid-19 at 9:00 PM ET today (01:00 GMT Thursday).
From a market perspective any measure the federal government will be taking to prevent the spread of the virus, such as further air travel restrictions, will be as closely watched as any mention of fiscal stimulus.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Stephen Mnuchin spoke by phone today, but there were no reports of any concrete moves to help the economy.
Movement in stock index futures as the president speaks will be an interesting barometer of how much Wall Street believes Trump’s statements, which have often conflicted with those of his health officials.
For those scoring at home, for the S&P 500 to enter into a bear market (the measure of whether the 11-year bull run is over), it would have to close below 2,714.82. It got there intraday today but closed higher.
2. ECB Expected to Ease
The European Central Bank’s governing council will meet tomorrow, with a package of stimulus measures expected.
Its monetary policy statement will arrive at 8:45 AM ET (12:45 GMT).
The “fact that they have negative yields is not dissuading investors to expect additional cuts,” Marvin Loh, Global Macro Strategist at  State Street  (NYSE:STT) Global Markets, said in a note.
The Bank of England cut rates by half a point today and the ECB should compare and contrast the analyses of the BoE and the Federal Reserve, “focusing in particular on the range of tools deployed and why, the overall framework, the communication, and the coordination,” Allianz (DE:ALVG) Chief Economic Advisor Mohamed El-Erian tweeted.


3. Wholesale Inflation on Tap
On the economic calendar there’s more inflation data to be had, although it's again looking a little stale for the current market-moving crowd.
The Labor Department will issue the latest producer price index (PPI) at 8:30 AM ET (12:30 GMT).
Economists expect that the February PPI fell 0.1%, compared with a rise of 0.5% the month before, according to forecasts compiled by Investing.com.
The core PPI, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, is expected to have risen 0.1%.

1616,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 11, 2020 05:56PM ET</span>",Cost of General Electric credit insurance rises along with coronavirus concerns,"By Alwyn Scott
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The cost to insure  General Electric  Co (N:GE) debt has shot up to levels last seen in 2018, possibly reflecting concern about the company's exposure to coronavirus-induced declines in interest rates, air travel and global growth.
GE credit default swaps, a measure of confidence in a company's capacity to repay debt, were priced at 200.7 basis points on Wednesday, up 119% from 91.67 a week ago, according to data from Markit.
It was their highest level since December 2018, just after GE's credit ratings were cut and investors worried its debt might become non-investment grade. A comparable credit default swap index of investment-grade companies is up about 60% over the same period.
A GE spokeswoman on Wednesday pointed to Chief Executive Larry Culp's remarks that coronavirus and last week's U.S. interest rate cut had not altered GE's 2020 debt-reduction goal.
""Things are volatile ... but given what we know today, we'll stand by that answer,"" Culp said of GE's forecast.
The spokeswoman also noted GE's cash assets. ""We have a strong liquidity position with more than $17 billion at GE Industrial, nearly $19 billion at GE Capital, and access to more than $35 billion of available credit facilities,"" she said. GE expects to receive about $20 billion in cash this quarter when its biopharma business sale to Danaher Corp (N:DHR) closes, she added.
The maker of jet engines, power plants and other industrial goods is struggling to generate profit and cash flow after ill-timed acquisitions and poor strategy moves in recent years. GE said last week that coronavirus could cut first-quarter cash flow by $500 million.
Culp told investors last week that GE is sensitive to interest rates. A 25 basis-point rate decline raises GE's pension obligation by $2.3 billion, he said. Lower rates also increase GE's liability on long-term care insurance policies.
The higher liabilities likely would cost GE billions, and it has limited funding to pay down debt, said John Inch, an analyst at investment firm Gordon Haskett in New York.
""That is the squeeze: Sell more business into weak markets? Tap into revolver?"" he said, referring to GE's $35 million revolving credit facility.
Other analysts cautioned about reading too much into CDS prices, and said virus effects may dissipate by the time GE's pension and insurance obligations are calculated this year.
""The key risk we see from the coronavirus issues is the impact on the economy and its effect on GE's cash flow and margins,"" said Eric Ause, a GE credit analyst at Fitch Ratings in Chicago. ""We're monitoring it.""
GE's total borrowings were $91 billion at the end of 2019. Its credit ratings were cut in late 2018 to three notches above non-investment grade levels at Fitch, Standard & Poors, and Moody's Investors Service."

(Reuters) - Investors are scrambling to adjust their portfolios to a surge of volatility in foreign exchange markets, as the coronavirus outbreak and massive swings in oil prices roil currencies around the globe.
Some of the recent moves in currencies have been among the most dramatic since the financial crisis. The Japanese yen notched a 5% price rise against the dollar between last Thursday and Monday, its largest three-day rally since 2008. Meanwhile, the Mexican peso and the Russian ruble are off 13% and 16% from their highs of the year, highlighting how the tumble in oil has hit emerging market currencies. 
The  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) FX Volatility Index <.DBCVIX> stood at 9.72 late on Wednesday after hitting a three-year high of 10.18 earlier in the week. Its rise follows a record low of 4.9 reached just a month ago, reflecting an upsurge of volatility that took most investors by surprise.
""The coronavirus and the oil price war (between Russia and Saudi Arabia) were both exogenous shocks - neither were in market pricing ... prior to occurring,"" said Simon Harvey, a London-based market analyst at Monex Europe.
(GRAPHIC: Deutsche Bank Currency Volatility Index - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/3170/3135/Pasted%20Image.jpg)
Some welcomed the turbulence, which comes after a long period of sleepy trading in foreign exchange markets that had smoothed out the price swings investors need to make money. 
""You are seeing stronger, more consistent trends in the currency market,"" said Kathy Lien, managing director of currency strategy at BK Asset Management. ""We've been trading actively.""
Lien has been selling the U.S. and Australian dollars, betting that these currencies will underperform the Japanese yen because the United States and Japan are delivering less stimulus to their economies than some investors expected. 
Momtchil Pojarliev, head of currencies at BNP Asset Management, earlier this year used options on the yen to bet on a rise in volatility, which was low by historical standards in January. 
""That was a good decision,"" he said. ""This is a great environment for us. We are saying, 'FX is back,'"" Pojarliev said.
The yen - a popular destination for nervous investors – is up about 7% from its lows against the dollar this year.
Elevated price swings have also hurt traders who had been wrongly positioned or taken on too much risk. 
Shares in the French bank  Natixis  SA (PA:CNAT) slumped on Wednesday on news its H20 Asset Management unit suffered ""surprisingly large"" losses because of bets on bonds and currencies that turned sour during the volatile market swings in recent days. 
The elevated volatility has also upended bets on emerging market currencies, where some investors seek to collect yields through a strategy called a carry trade, which tends to prosper when markets are placid. 
The MSCI EM Currencies Index (MIEM00000CUS) is off 3.7% from its January highs.
The rapid decline in the dollar ""strangled"" investors who had piled into the currency in recent months looking to take advantage of comparatively high U.S. yields, said Ugo Lancioni, head of global currency at Neuberger Berman.
The U.S. dollar index (=USD) is off about 3.4% from a nearly three-year high hit in late February as market participants rushed to price in plunging Treasury yields and expectations of more rate cuts from the Federal Reserve. 
As a result, ""the U.S. dollar has failed to provide the risk-off protection that it has provided in the past"" in the recent sell-off, Lancioni said. 
The euro, meanwhile, has rallied from multiyear lows and moved in opposition to U.S. stock markets in recent weeks, squeezing investors out of bets that the currency would continue to decline.
Net bets on a weaker euro in the futures market stood at about 86,000 contracts, after rising to a more than three-year high of 114,000 contracts in late February, data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) showed.

The company, which has liquidated 19 stores in partnership with financial services firm Tiger Capital Group, said it will start closure sales at its remaining stores beginning Friday.
Traditional brick-and-mortar retailers in the United States have been under immense pressure, as consumers increasingly prefer to shop from online giants such as Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) and Walmart Inc (N:WMT).
The privately owned Modell's, which calls itself the oldest U.S. family owned and operated sporting goods retailer, said it will also continue to explore recapitalization through a potential sale of some or all its assets.
Chief Executive Officer Mitchell Modell has in recent interviews said a warmer-than-normal winter hurt sales of cold-weather merchandise, while the New York Yankees' failure to make the baseball World Series and the New York Jets and Giants football teams' losing records hurt jersey sales.
Several sporting goods retailers have gone out of business over the last five years, including City Sports, Sports Authority, Sports Chalet and MC Sports.
Modell's, which was founded in 1889 by Morris Modell as a single store on Cortlandt Street in lower Manhattan, operated over 140 stores across several northeastern and mid-Atlantic U.S. states. 

Some stores, including in Manhattan, had already been undergoing closing sales.

Investing.com – The Dow closed in bear-market territory Wednesday, led by a slump in energy and industrials, as coronavirus infections continue to rise worldwide, threatening to push the global economy into a recession.
The World Health Organization declared the coronavirus a global pandemic, sending the market into a selling frenzy.
The S&P 500 slumped 4.9%, though had entered a bear market intraday, but managed to close above those levels thanks to some late buying. The Nasdaq Composite lost 4.7%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 5.9%, or 1,465 points, putting it more than 20% below its recent highs, constituting a bear market.
Industrials fell 6%, paced by a slump in Boeing (NYSE:BA) after the aircraft maker reported weak orders and detailed plans to draw down the rest of a $13.8 billion loan facility. Boeing closed below $200 for the first time since July 2017.
Energy also fell 6% as oil prices slumped 4% amid ongoing fears of an oil price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia. In further signs of fears over slowing oil demand, OPEC and the Energy Information Administration cut their 2020 global oil demand forecasts.
“This energy bear market is unique in that it is both a demand and supply event,” said Bob Yawger at Mizuho. “The market is trending lower on coronavirus concerns and it is lower on Russia and Saudi Arabia adding supply for size to the market.”
In tech, meanwhile, chip stocks came under heavy selling pressure, with the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index falling 5.7%.
Despite the sea of red on Wall Street, some market observers have warned the correction has further room to run as investors worry the stimulus efforts from global institutions may not offset the impact of the coronavirus.  
 ""Investor sentiment has adjusted lower, but risk premia are likely to remain elevated amidst concerns on the efficacy of potential policy responses,"" strategist Daniel Grosvenor said.

1624,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 11, 2020 04:11PM ET</span>","Boeing to freeze hiring as cash woes mount over coronavirus, 737 MAX","By Eric M. Johnson and Tim Hepher
SEATTLE/PARIS (Reuters) -  Boeing Co  (N:BA) is freezing new hiring and overtime except in certain critical areas to preserve cash, the U.S. planemaker's CEO said on Wednesday, as the coronavirus outbreak compounds the fallout from a year-old grounding of its money-spinning 737 MAX.
The twin global crises, and news that Boeing is planning to draw down the rest of a $13.8 billion loan it took last month, sent shares down more than 14% to almost a three-year low on Wednesday amid a broader market dip over the spreading virus.
Boeing Chief Executive Dave Calhoun told employees on Wednesday the company was taking steps to address the business pressures that result from ""the pain our customers and suppliers are feeling.""
""It's critical for any company to preserve cash in challenging periods,"" Calhoun wrote in a memo seen by Reuters.
Layoffs or furloughs were also a ""real possibility"" but were seen as a separate, later action, one person familiar with the company's thinking said. A second industry source said job cuts were likely as the aviation industry is squeezed by plummeting travel demand and a safety ban on the 737 MAX after two fatal crashes hit the one-year mark.
A Boeing official said there were no plans at this time for job cuts but the company was closely monitoring business conditions. 
The cash preservation strategy comes as Boeing scrambles to curb fallout from the year-old grounding of the 737 MAX jet after crashes in Ethiopia and Indonesia killed 346 people five months apart. 
The worldwide safety ban wiped billions off the company's value and sparked hundreds of lawsuits from bereaved families.
Boeing took in 18 new orders for widebody planes in February but saw more customers cancel 737 MAX orders. 
Separately, a person familiar with the matter said Boeing was drawing down the loan because of overall market volatility and not due to the changing of the return to service date for the 737 MAX, which has been pushed back for months and is now expected at earliest mid-year. 
Boeing took the extraordinary step of preserving production staffing levels when shutting down 737 MAX production earlier this year in order to be ready to ramp back up when the 737 MAX wins regulatory approvals to return to service. 
But the depth of the coronavirus outbreaks and the demand by airlines to defer orders and delay pre-delivery payments has increased pressure on Boeing and forced it to consider tougher steps to reduce cash outflow, the people said.
United Airlines (O:UAL), for example, slashed its 2020 capital expenditure on Tuesday, a move that will halt jet deliveries and push back its timeline for future deliveries.
""To be clear, we will not be taking delivery of even a single aircraft in that CapEx forecast unless it is fully financed until the crisis is over,"" United President Scott Kirby told investors.
As of Jan. 21, United's main 2020 aircraft delivery commitments were with Boeing, including two 777-300s and 15 787s. It was also due to receive 28 737 MAXs, pending regulatory approval.
Boeing will want to avoid cutting into the resources needed for a smooth ramp up in 737 production, however, the people said. Losing workers to other companies in a tight labor market or training new ones would complicate such efforts.

""You'll hear from us often through this uncertain period ahead,"" Calhoun told employees. ""We'll be clear about the challenges. And we'll be transparent as we consider additional affordability measures.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. passenger railroad Amtrak said on Wednesday that bookings had plunged 50% since the coronavirus outbreak and that it now expected significant service reductions and losses of hundreds of millions of dollars.
Amtrak Senior Vice President Stephen Gardner told employees in a memo seen by Reuters that service ""reductions have accelerated in recent days and will likely continue for some time. Our future bookings are down 50% year-over-year and our cancellations are up more than 300%.""
He added that ""as people reevaluate and change their travel plans ... . At this rate, we believe we will likely suffer the loss of several hundred million dollars in revenue during this fiscal year – and we might lose more.""
Amtrak is launching aggressive measures to cut costs and Gardner said it would need to do more, including plans for ""significant reductions in train service across portions of our network in response to the sharp drop in ridership."" Amtrak will also offer voluntary leave for non-critical employees.
On March 2, Amtrak said was on pace this year to achieve operational breakeven for the first time in the company’s 49-year history even as it invests billions in new high-speed Acela trains and other capital assets.
It said in November it had set records for ridership, revenue and financial performance for the year ended Sept. 30, 2019, including 32.5 million customer trips, a year-over-year increase of 800,000 passengers.
Amtrak reported a loss of $29.8 million in its last fiscal year compared with a loss of $170.6 million in the prior fiscal year.
Amtrak said it had been in talks with Congress about the drop-off in ridership. On Friday, Amtrak cut three non-stop Acela trains from New York to Washington, citing lower demand."

(Reuters) - Brian Lesser, chief executive of AT&T (NYSE:T) Inc's advertising unit Xandr, has resigned, a source familiar with the matter said on Wednesday, raising questions about the future of its advanced advertising strategy. 
A spokesman for AT&T declined to comment. Lesser was not immediately reachable. 
Lesser had interviewed for the CEO role at WarnerMedia, AT&T's media unit, but received an indication that he would not be selected, the source said.
A replacement at Xandr is not yet known.
AT&T has spent a combined $134 billion to buy satellite TV provider DirecTV and media company Time Warner to take on Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) and then craft a digital and TV advertising strategy that would make use of the combined companies' assets. 
The company launched Xandr in 2018 to offer partners a better way to target ads to consumers using data collected from phone, internet and TV services. 
Lesser felt comfortable stepping down because Xandr is in a good position and its first quarter results are expected to show significant growth, the source said.
A long-time advertising executive, Lesser joined AT&T in 2017 and was previously CEO of ad agency GroupM North America. Lesser also founded Xaxis, an ad technology company. 
At Xandr, he oversaw the purchase of ad tech companies AppNexus and clypd to give Xandr the technical capabilities of selling digital and TV ads.
However, ad agency executives who spoke with Reuters earlier this year have viewed Xandr's progress as slow, citing few new product offerings for advertisers since its launch.
A spokeswoman for Xandr did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
News of Lesser's resignation came on the same day the company announced a move toward its long-stated goal of changing how TV ads are purchased. 
On Wednesday, Xandr launched a TV ad-buying tool in partnership with Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co, AMC Networks and WarnerMedia that would allow advertisers to target certain viewers across the networks using AT&T data.
One ad agency executive who did not want to be named said the timing of Lesser's resignation was a surprise. The executive added that clients would be advised against using Xandr's new ad buying tool until there was more clarity surrounding the company's technology strategy.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The top U.S. securities regulator has increased its scrutiny of private funds that make higher-risk loans over the last two years, according to a Reuters review of SEC actions and industry and regulatory sources -- just as fears of a global recession hit the booming private credit market.
The intensified oversight from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) could have deeper consequences as the financial turmoil wrought by the coronavirus and an oil price war increases the risk of corporate and individual defaults and raises pressure on fund managers to hide losses.
A spokesman for the SEC declined to comment. A Commission staffer who spoke on condition of anonymity confirmed that private debt funds were an area of increased focus given money pouring in to them, increased risk in their loans, and room for pricing manipulation, especially in a recession.
""We've had a lot of concerns over private lending,"" the person said. 
Private debt funds manage hundreds of billions of dollars globally but, unlike banks, are not subject to the same stress tests and capital requirements. This, combined with relative opacity -- the loans are negotiated in private or purchased through intermediary platforms -- mean there is more room for abuse of fiduciary duties to investors, market analysts said.
Scrutiny of once-hotshot lender Brendan Ross is indicative of the SEC's new focus.
Ross' Los Angeles-area firm, Direct Lending Investments LLC (DLI), quickly amassed nearly $1 billion under management after years of unbroken monthly profits from loans to small businesses. Ross was a frequent public champion of direct lending in appearances on CNBC, Fox Business and at the Milken Institute's Global Conference, popular with Wall Street financiers.
DLI's marketing materials said it was ""unique in its ability to deliver double-digit, unlevered returns"" with little risk of default. 
The results were too good to be true, according to the SEC. In March 2019, it charged DLI with a multi-year fraud, alleging that Ross had engineered falsified payments on bad loans in order to prop up returns, thereby overcharging investors on fees.
Ross has departed DLI, which is now in receivership with an expected recovery of no more than 40% of its par value.
An attorney for Ross, Jahan Raissi, said in a statement that his client denies the SEC’s allegations and ""very much regrets that investors - of which he is one - are likely to suffer a loss.""  
Raissi added that Ross ""strongly disagrees with any implication that he was the cause of DLI’s business failing"".
DLI is not the only private debt fund to have drawn SEC scrutiny of late.
After a scattering of previous cases, the markets watchdog has asked questions of at least eight private debt fund managers over the past two years, resulting in four public enforcement actions or settlements for infractions such as ignoring loan losses or falsifying borrower payments, according to public disclosures, as well as information and documents reviewed by Reuters.
""These funds are obvious targets for SEC action given the strong temptation for accounting shenanigans on loans,"" said Howard Fischer, a former senior SEC enforcement attorney now working at law firm Moses & Singer LLP.
""A recession and its ripple effects on borrowers would only accelerate financial games.""
BOOMING BUSINESS
As banks retreated from risky lending in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, investors, both small funds and major Wall Street money managers, filled the gap in search of returns (story here https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-funds-lending-idUSKBN1A90CJ). 
Private debt funds managed a record $812 billion globally --more than double the amount in 2012 -- with nearly $500 million in North America as of June 1, 2019, according to data provider Preqin. Direct lending is the largest sub-strategy, followed by distressed debt-focused funds.
Jiří Król, deputy CEO and global head of government affairs at trade group Alternative Investment Management Association, said private credit funds were crucial for smaller businesses but they needed the right internal controls. 
""The name of the game is industrial grade infrastructure and those who don't reach that level will struggle to satisfy not just investors but borrowers and regulators alike,"" Król said in a statement.
While large money managers including Blackstone (NYSE:BX) Group, Ares Management LP and BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK) control the bulk of the assets in private debt, the SEC's recent enforcement activity has focused on smaller privately-run players.
Like DLI, Miami-area direct lender TCA Fund Management Group Corp. marketed a multi-year run of uninterrupted profits from lending to small businesses. 
In January, TCA disclosed to investors that it was the subject of an SEC probe and was liquidating its main fund (story here https://www.reuters.com/article/hedgefunds-tca-sec/sec-probes-florida-private-lender-over-accounting-questions-idUSL1N29S114). TCA employees have filed multiple whistleblower complaints to the SEC over the firm's accounting practices, including papering over loan losses and booking phantom fees for advisory work, according to a person familiar with the situation and an NBC News report https://www.nbcnews.com/business/markets/whistleblowers-say-florida-investment-firm-has-inflated-value-earnings-its-n1120746.
The whistleblowers allege that TCA has far less than the nearly $500 million in assets it reported in an SEC filing last year, the person said based on knowledge of the complaints.
Founder Robert Press and TCA attorney Carl Schoeppl did not respond to multiple requests for comment. Schoeppl said in January that TCA “treats this matter very seriously” and had offered full cooperation with the SEC.
Other SEC enforcement actions include International Investment Group LLC, which consented to a settlement over charges it hid losses in its main hedge fund and sold at least $60 million in fake loans; LendingClub Asset Management LLC, which agreed to settle over charges of propping up bad loans with related-party money; and Prosper Funding LLC, which paid a $3 million penalty for “materially overstating” returns to investors without admitting or denying the findings.
There are also signs the SEC is testing lending businesses even if it does not lead to an enforcement action.
Ranger Alternative Management LP, an investment firm in Dallas, was found to have “deficiencies and weaknesses in controls,"" including transparency around its direct lending positions, according to a post-examination letter from March 2018 sent to the firm’s general counsel and reviewed by Reuters. 
One of those positions, New Jersey-based direct lender Princeton Alternative Income Fund LP, filed for bankruptcy protection around the same time and was itself the subject of an SEC investigation into ""certain pre-bankruptcy transactions and practices,"" according to a September 2018 court filing by the SEC. 

The SEC has taken no public action on the matter against Princeton or Ranger, which is winding down its direct lending bets. Representatives for Princeton did not respond to requests for comment. A spokesman for Ranger declined to comment.

(Reuters) - Warren Buffett plans to wait until around April 1 to decide whether the coronavirus pandemic will require changes to Berkshire Hathaway Inc's (N:BRKa) annual shareholder weekend a month later, Omaha, Nebraska's mayor Jean Stothert said.
The pandemic appears increasingly likely to disrupt a weekend that Buffett, who is Berkshire's chairman and among the world's most revered investors, calls Woodstock for Capitalists and is corporate America's largest gathering.
Speaking at a news conference to discuss the impact of the outbreak on Omaha, Stothert said the billionaire called her on Monday night, and said his ""preference"" was to wait until a month before the May 1-3 weekend to evaluate the situation and recommendations of health and other public officials.
The weekend includes Berkshire's annual meeting, scheduled for May 2.
""He said that, he's a very responsible person, and public safety is a priority for him,"" Stothert said.
Buffett's assistant did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The World Health Organization on Wednesday declared the coronavirus outbreak that began in China a pandemic.
Berkshire's shareholder weekend typically attracts 40,000 or more people to Omaha, including 5,000 from China.
Events that normally draw large crowds of people include the annual meeting, a cocktail reception, a picnic, a 5-kilometer (3.1-mile) run, and shareholder shopping discounts.
Buffett, 89, routinely mingles with shareholders and fans, sometimes with a horde of reporters, photographers and TV staff in close proximity.
The meeting features Buffett and Berkshire Vice Chairman Charlie Munger, 96, answering several hours of shareholder questions in an arena that holds close to 19,000 people and is normally filled at the start.
Health experts consider elderly people the most at risk of dying from the coronavirus. 
Berkshire said last week that the meeting, which is being live-streamed by Yahoo (NASDAQ:AABA) Finance, will occur ""irrespective of conditions at that time,"" but other events may be changed.
Many companies are moving annual meetings online to help contain the coronavirus outbreak, and a growing number of countries and cities worldwide are banning or recommending the curtailing of large events.
Hotels in downtown Omaha normally sell out nearly a year in advance for Berkshire's weekend, but a handful that were fully booked last month now have vacancies.

Within Omaha, the outbreak caused the scrapping of this weekend's baseball series between Creighton University and Central Connecticut State University, and may affect the College World Series of baseball, scheduled for June 13 to 24.

It also extended the suspension for some destinations in South Korea and Japan to the same date and said it will reduce planned capacity by 15%.
The airline sector has been hit hard by the rapidly spreading coronavirus, which has forced tourists and businesses to cancel trips, sparking a string of steps by carriers to tackle the impact of the outbreak.
Delta said it has frozen hiring, offered voluntary leave option to staff and was planning retire older aircraft ahead of time to limit the fallout of a drop in net booking by as much as 25% to 30%.

Shares of the company fell as much as 8.2% to $41.73, in line with the broader selloff in the sector on Wednesday. The stock has fallen nearly 30% so far this year.

1637,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 11, 2020 02:31PM ET</span>",UK debt agency sees risk 2020/21 gilt issuance will need to rise further,"By David Milliken
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain is likely to need to issue even more debt on top of the big increase announced on Wednesday for the coming financial year, as the full cost of measures to fight the coronavirus was not included, debt agency chief Robert Stheeman said.
Shortly after finance minister Rishi Sunak's first budget speech, the UK Debt Management Office said gross gilt issuance would need to rise to 156.1 billion pounds ($200.7 billion) this year from 136.9 billion pounds the year before.
This is the highest amount since 2012/13, when the cost of the financial crisis bumped up Britain's budget deficit, though below the median 166.6 billion pounds predicted by gilt dealers polled by Reuters before the budget.
Stheeman, who heads the DMO, said his agency and forecasters at the Office for Budget Responsibility did not have Sunak's final budget figures when they estimated the borrowing needs.
The OBR's growth figures also do not factor in the likely full impact of the coronavirus on economic growth.
Sunak announced 5 billion pounds of extra funding for the National Health Service and up to 7 billion pounds for businesses in tax breaks and compensation for staff sick pay, which were not included in the main budget figures.
""When things become clearer, I would not want to rule out that the Treasury revises our remit,"" Stheeman told Reuters, referring to the amount of money the DMO is tasked to raise by selling debt.
It would be ""reasonable"" to expect an upward revision, he added, without giving a figure.
Investors have so far taken the rise in British government borrowing needs in their stride. Gilt prices were little changed by the budget plan on Wednesday.
Fears about the economic impact of the virus on businesses have boosted demand for safer assets such as government bonds. On Monday, two-year gilt yields briefly turned negative and the 10-year benchmark yield hit a record-low 0.074%.
Stheeman described this pricing as ""extraordinary"".
Extra issuance next year will focus more heavily on short-dated gilts, the most liquid part of the market, which Stheeman said was best-placed to absorb Britain's higher borrowing needs.
Gilt dealers have told the DMO that the market turmoil was hurting liquidity, though a 10-year gilt auction on Tuesday passed smoothly.
""My guess is that perhaps until the full extent of the economic impact of the coronavirus in particular is clear, we are probably going to go through quite an illiquid patch,"" Stheeman said.
The DMO has no plan to postpone future gilt auctions if the coronavirus outbreak worsens, and Stheeman said the DMO and dealers had contingency plans - including separate sites - to reduce the chance of this being necessary.
""We like others in the market ... are obviously taking whatever precautions we can to ensure that we remain fully operational.""

Washington state Gov. Jay Inslee placed a ban on large gatherings in several counties across the state to limit the spread of Covid-19.. San Francisco health officials, meanwhile, announced that they are also banning gatherings of 1,000 or more to contain the virus.
The World Health Organization declared Covid-19 a global pandemic as the virus has spread globally, with infections now topping 120,000.
Investor hopes of U.S. stimulus measures to boost economic growth, meanwhile, were given a boost amid reports that White House is in favor of declaring a national disaster under the Stafford Act to free up to $40 billion in immediate aid, Politico reported. 
Trump a day earlier floated the idea of temporarily suspending payroll taxes to cushion the economic blow from the virus outbreak. "

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration is set to discuss new travel restrictions on European countries at a meeting on Wednesday in response to the coronavirus pandemic, sources familiar with the discussions said.
The plan could mirror a ban on travel to the United States placed on foreigners who visited China in the prior two weeks, which was later extended to Iran, three of the sources said. Advisories recommending Americans cancel travel to certain European countries is also under consideration, said the people, who requested anonymity because the talks were sensitive.
It was not immediately clear whether the administration would reach a decision or make an announcement on Wednesday. Additional restrictions have been discussed routinely for weeks but have fresh urgency as the number of cases and the death toll outside of China have soared in the United States and abroad.
The U.S. State Department is also considering raising the travel advisory for potentially all of Europe to ""Level 3: Reconsider Travel,"" airline and U.S. officials confirmed.
Robert Redfield, the head of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), told a congressional hearing that Europe was a rising source of U.S. coronavirus cases.
""Where our real threat right now is Europe. That's where the cases are coming in,"" Redfield said. ""If you want to just be blunt, Europe is the new China.""
Two weeks ago the State Department raised the travel advisory level for Italy and South Korea, calling on U.S. citizens to reconsider travel there and avoid trips to the regions hardest hit by the respiratory illness. It has also coordinated efforts to screen would-be travelers to the United States from those countries before boarding. 
But the administration has credited the ban on travel from China - imposed in late January - with slowing the spread of the virus, prompting questions about why it has not yet extended the measure to cover other hard-hit countries. 
Vice President Mike Pence was to meet later at the White House with members of the coronavirus task force, which has been deliberating on a wide variety of related issues. 

Pence said in a news briefing on Tuesday that the coronavirus task force had a thorough discussion earlier in the day about the prospect of recommending further travel advisories to President Donald Trump.

1642,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 11, 2020 02:01PM ET</span>",Britain plans to apply Basel bank capital rules in full,"By Huw Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain said on Wednesday it plans to fully implement globally-agreed bank capital rules that were a response to the financial crisis a decade ago.
Tougher Basel capital rules were devised by global financial regulators to prevent a repeat of the 2008 crisis when taxpayers had to bail out undercapitalized banks.
Much of the package has been implemented but some remaining elements will come into force over the next few years and European banks have been lobbying to water some of them down.
Britain's finance ministry said it intends to implement recent revisions to the Basel capital rules to demonstrate ""the government's ongoing commitment to implementing leading global standards in financial services"".
Bank of England Deputy Governor Sam Woods has singled out European banks for wanting to set off investment in software against capital requirements, a step he does not want Britain to take.
The ministry said it wants a ""flexible approach"" to rulemaking that ensures continued ""proportionality"" for non-systemic investment firms and supports UK competitiveness in global financial services.
The ministry said there would be public consultations on implementing the remaining Basel rules.
RULES ""GRID""
The ministry said a regulatory initiatives ""grid"" would be launched over the summer to give a two-year heads-up on what new rules are coming up.
This is in response to the financial sector saying it is often faced with a plethora of new rules at same time from different regulators, making it hard to comply in a timely way.
""The grid will be published twice a year and will set out an indicative timetable for each regulatory initiative,"" the ministry said.
It will include all of Britain's main financial regulators along with the Competition and Markets Authority, with a ministry official as an observer.
Stephen Jones, CEO of UK Finance, said the announcement of the grid was a positive step and showed the government had taken on board the finance industry's concerns.
“Good coordination between regulators helps to ensure the flow of regulatory activity is manageable for firms and avoids unintended interactions and unnecessary costs,"" he said.
“We look forward to working closely with the Treasury and regulators on the detail of these measures.”"

1645,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 11, 2020 01:36PM ET</span>",U.S. states struggle to expand coronavirus testing despite federal push,"By Carl O'Donnell and Nathan Layne
NEW YORK (Reuters) - New York and Washington, the U.S. states hit the hardest by the coronavirus outbreak, are struggling to make testing for the virus widely available, with local officials estimating it could take weeks more to reach peak testing capacity.
While 1,039 people have been confirmed to have the virus in the United States - and 29 have died - according to data from Johns Hopkins University, experts estimate the real number of cases may be far greater.
An unidentified flaw in test kits distributed by the federal government in February, which gave some false results, has set the country back in containing an outbreak that has infected more than 121,000 people worldwide.
Boosting testing is crucial, disease experts say, to assessing the scope of the U.S. outbreak and identifying where it is spreading most rapidly.
Vice President Mike Pence said on March 4 that roughly 1.5 million tests would be available by the end of that week, while President Donald Trump told reporters on Friday that ""anyone who wants a test, gets a test"". 
But more than a week later, the ramp up has been much slower due to regulatory hurdles at the federal and state level, as well as logistical and technical challenges, according to healthcare providers, public health officials and test makers.
SUPPLY CHAIN ISSUES
Nowhere illustrates the constraints on testing more than an outbreak at the Life Care Center nursing home in Kirkland, Washington, which alone accounts for 19 of 24 coronavirus-related deaths in the state.
Despite huge concern over how quickly the virus could spread there, about 150 of the 180 staff have not been tested. Life Care Center spokesman Tim Killian said the problem was a lack of kits to test employees.
Vanessa Phelps, whose 90-year old mother is a resident at the nursing home, was tested twice for coronavirus in a single week because she had been a frequent visitor. She cannot understand why all people affiliated with Life Care have not undergone testing.
""If they don't test everyone, one worker could still have it and be passing it around because people are still dying,"" said Phelps, who ultimately tested negative. 
The state has increased capacity to about 1,000 tests per day at the University of Washington School of Medicine, and local officials say they are ready to help.
Alex Greninger, assistant director of UW Medicine Clinical Virology Laboratories, said the lab was not being fully utilized due to supply-chain issues as simple as there not being people to pick up specimens and take them to the lab.
""HEIGHTENED ANXIETY""
New York has 176 confirmed coronavirus cases, second only to Washington's 273, according to data from a interactive map compiled by John Hopkins. 
On Tuesday, Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that schools, houses of worship and large gathering venues in the Manhattan suburb of New Rochelle would shut down for two weeks. In New York City, more than 2,000 people are in self-isolation over concerns they were exposed to the virus.
Cuomo said that as of last week, the state was able to run 500 tests per day and wants to increase that capacity to 1,000 daily.
The state now provides testing at two public health labs and announced on Sunday an agreement with non-profit healthcare system Northwell Health to expand testing capacity.
New York's Department of Health has prohibited hospitals from testing patients unless they meet strict criteria, such as having traveled to a country with a high risk of infection or having contact with an infected person. 
Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan has tested about 10 people so far, nearly all of them since the weekend after the lab at Northwell began taking samples, said Dr. Marta Feldmesser, the chief of infectious diseases.
The Northwell lab can provide results in a day, whereas the city health department was having difficulty keeping up with demand, Feldmesser said.
""The issues around testing are a lot of the reason for the heightened anxiety that we see. Because we haven't really been able to identify who has it,"" Feldmesser said. ""I wish we could test anybody who wants to be tested."" 
LOSING COUNT
U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar told CNN on Tuesday that current testing capacity was roughly 10,000 tests per day nationwide. 
Azar also said the federal government has lost the ability to keep exact count of tests as local and commercial labs play a larger role in testing. 
The introduction of tests by Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings (N:LH) and Quest Diagnostics Inc (N:DGX), two of the nation's largest diagnostic companies, is expected to greatly expand capacity beginning this week.
Quest said that it anticipated performing several thousands tests by the end of the week. LabCorp also said it can now conduct several thousands tests daily. Another major lab test provider, BioReference Laboratories, a subsidiary of OPKO Health Inc (O:OPK), told Reuters that it expected to be able to conduct as many as 2,000 tests per day nationwide by the week's end. 
""Our door is open for any developers who want to have a test for use in the U.S.,"" the Food and Drug Administration said in an emailed statement. The agency said it had received dozens of requests from parties interested in developing their own tests.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The New York Stock Exchange is taking steps to separate traders on the floor of its iconic 11 Wall Street building and employees of the NYSE and its parent Intercontinental Exchange Inc (N:ICE), to reduce the risk of spreading coronavirus, according to an internal memo sent Wednesday.
The steps, which include mandating separate entrances and eating spaces for floor traders and staff, are aimed at reducing the likelihood that an event in the building's office tower will impact operations on the trading floor, NYSE Chief Operating Officer Michael Blaugrund, said in the memo, seen by Reuters.
Non-working visitors to the NYSE floor have been kept to a minimum this week, the building has intensified overnight cleaning efforts, and an outside vendor will provide extra deep cleaning on weekends, it said.
""Given the critical work by our NYSE and NYSE American floor communities to underpin the orderly function of global markets, all of these efforts, and others, will remain ongoing until further notice,"" the memo said.
Concerns about how the fast-spreading coronavirus will affect the economy have led to global stock market routs, with volumes and volatility spiking to levels not seen since the 2007-2009 financial crisis.
While nearly all U.S. stock trading is done electronically, the NYSE says its hybrid electronic and floor broker model helps keep trading more orderly.
But even the Big Board can operate fully electronically if the floor needs to be shut. The NYSE and exchange operators Nasdaq Inc (O:NDAQ), Cboe Global Markets Inc (Z:CBOE), and IEX Group have all said they have regularly tested contingency plans in place to ensure continuous trading if the coronavirus leads to some facilities being temporarily shuttered.
To reduce the chance of that happening, only NYSE and ICE staff who work in the 11 Wall Street's office tower will be able to eat in the NYSE cafeteria, the memo said. Those who work on the floor will have access to a special food service from NYSE's Trading Floor Coffee Kiosk.
A restaurant on the exchange's 7th floor named 1792, after the year the NYSE was founded under a buttonwood tree on Wall Street, will be temporarily closed."

Several have grounded many flights and ditched their financial outlooks.
Below is a list of how the world's biggest airlines have responded to the sharp drop in travel demand since the outbreak forced a multitude of cancellations.
AIR FRANCE KLM (PA:AIRF)
Air France expects to cancel 3,600 flights in March, including cutting 25% of its European capacity and a 13% reduction in long-haul flights. Its Dutch arm KLM expects to reduce long-haul capacity by a similar amount.
The group carried just under 7 million passengers in February, down 0.5% from a year earlier, but warned the impact of the outbreak would show up more in the coming months.
AIR NEW ZEALAND (NZ:AIR)
Air New Zealand has withdrawn its full-year earnings outlook, frozen hiring, offered unpaid leave to staff and said it would cut more capacity.
The airline said its network capacity would fall by 10% between February and June, including a 26% cut to Asia, 7% to Australia and 4% in the domestic market.
ALASKA AIR GROUP (N:ALK)
The U.S. carrier has seen 270,000 cancellations for February.
For March, departures bookings fell by 265,000 since Feb. 24 and it is aggressively monitoring loss-making flights while considering cutting capacity by 3%.
AMERICAN AIRLINES INC (O:AAL)
American Airlines is cutting domestic capacity by 7.5% in April and international by 10% for the summer season.
Chief Executive Officer Doug Parker said his airline had $7.3 billion in available capital and was eyeing cost savings such as reduced pilot training classes.
BRITISH AIRWAYS (L:ICAG)
IAG-owned British Airways canceled all fights to and from Italy on Tuesday after the country was put on lockdown until next month.
Parent company International Consolidated Airlines Group, which also includes Iberia, said last month that the virus would hit earnings this year, but it could not tell by how much.
DELTA AIR LINES (O:DAL)
Delta said it has seen net bookings fall by 25% to 30% and expected the situation to worsen further.
The airline is cutting domestic capacity by 10% to 15% and international by 20% to 25%, freezing hiring, offering voluntary leave options to staff and looking at early retirement of older aircraft.
JETBLUE AIRWAYS CORP (O:JBLU)
JetBlue, which pulled its first-quarter and 2020 earnings forecast, said it was adjusting schedules between March and early May and was considering more flight cancellations.
JetBlue said the outbreak is expected to make at least a six percentage-point dent in its total revenue per available seat mile in the first quarter.
The carrier was considering voluntary time-off programs for employees, delaying some hiring and increasing the frequency with which it cleans aircraft.
DEUTSCHE LUFTHANSA AG (DE:LHAG)
The German carrier is cancelling up to 25% of flights across the group up to the end of March and will slash up to half the flights across its stable of airlines from April.
The company, which includes Swiss International Air Lines and Austrian Airlines, also said it was considering temporarily grounding its entire fleet of 14 Airbus SE (PA:AIR) A380 superjumbos in Frankfurt and Munich, out of total fleet of 763.
Lufthansa said other measures included offering staff unpaid leave, reduced hours or bringing forward annual leave.
NORWEGIAN AIR (OL:NWC)
Norwegian Air will lay off staff and cut around 3,000 flights between mid-March and mid-June corresponding to around 15% of its capacity. The cancellations add to an already difficult financial situation at Norwegian, which last week scrapped its 2020 outlook and has lost 70% of its market value this year.
QANTAS AIRWAYS (QAN.AX)
Qantas Airways will cut its international capacity by nearly 25% over the next six months and delay an order for Airbus A350 planes.
Qantas' chief executive Alan Joyce will take no salary for the rest of the current financial year, the management team will receive no bonuses and all staff are being encouraged to take paid or unpaid leave.
The airline said it could no longer provide guidance on the outbreak's financial impact, which at the time of its half-year results on Feb. 20 it had estimated at A$100 million to A$150 million hit to underlying core earnings this financial year.
SOUTHWEST AIRLINES CO (N:LUV)
Chief Executive Officer Gary Kelly is taking a 10% pay cut and was quoted in a media report as saying the carrier may ground airplanes and furlough employees, if conditions continue to worsen.
Southwest will take other steps to reduce costs, such as freezing hiring for non-frontline workers, according to the report. (https://on.wsj.com/2wLtuvs)
SPIRIT AIRLINES (N:SAVE)
The U.S. airline said it was cutting fares by up to 70% and trimming April capacity by about 5%.
TURKISH AIRLINES (IS:THYAO)
Turkish Airlines sees 5% decline in bookings for the coming months, with flights to Asia most affected. It said that 2020 targets will have to be revised and that several scenarios, including decreasing the frequency and capacity of flights, were being evaluated.
UNITED AIRLINES HOLDINGS INC (O:UAL)
The Chicago-based airline will not take jet deliveries or add capacity until it sees demand returning, which it said could take 18 months.
The airline expects to report a first-quarter loss and revenue to fall as much as 70% in April and May and 20% in November and December.
It said on March 10 it had raised $2 billion in new capital to bring liquidity to $8 billion and slashed its 2020 capital expenditure by more than a third to about $4.5 billion."
1654,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 11, 2020 12:07PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Europe plans multi-million-euro loans for coronavirus-hit firms: sources,"By John O'Donnell and Francesco Guarascio
PARIS/BRUSSELS (Reuters) - European companies grappling with the impact of Coronavirus could soon qualify for multi-million-euro loans backed by the European Union and big banks in a scheme poised to get waved through in days, according to people familiar with the matter.
The blueprint would see the release of hundreds of millions of euros of affordable loans for small companies, such as hotels, to tide them over while they recover from a trough in sales as the virus spreads, three people said.
This could form a central pillar of European governments' anxiously-awaited response to a crisis that has seen public life in Italy grind to a near halt, schools shut from Spain to Greece and sent financial markets into a spin.
It would complement other support measures expected to be announced by the European Central Bank on Thursday, to bolster the economy.
The plan, which is under discussion and has not been finalized, would revolve around the European Investment Bank (EIB), a powerful institution backed primarily by Germany, Italy and France as well as the other 24 EU members.
One option under consideration would see the EIB team up with some of Europe's biggest banks to jointly provide hundreds of millions of euros of affordable loans, the people said. Discussions with those banks are now under way. 
To solve the risk of default rebounding on the EIB, which could tarnish its top-notch credit rating, the project could draw on the EU bloc's joint budget to cover potential losses if, say, a hotel taking the loan went bust, two of the people said.
The European Commission said ""helping hard-hit businesses ... to provide short-term liquidity is a key part of the EU's economic policy response to the Coronavirus crisis"".
A spokeswoman said it was working on options with the EIB that could be implemented immediately. The EIB declined to comment. 
European Union finance ministers could consider whether to give the plan a thumbs up when they gather for meetings slated for Monday and Tuesday in Brussels, one of the people said. 
This guarantee would make it easier for banks to lend. They would do the credit checking and give the loan, said two people, and could also bear some of the loss if the company who takes the credit cannot repay.
French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire, who has led calls for a coordinated European response to the crisis, put pressure on the EIB ahead of a meeting on Monday with its head Werner Hoyer saying it must ""mobilise resources"".
The scheme would be part of a wider plan to help the European economy recover from the impact of Coronavirus. The EU's executive Commission will this week review rules on borrowing and state subsidies, making it easier for Italy, the worst-affected country in Europe, to spend.
It has also said it wants to redirect billions of euros of EU funds, typically used for infrastructure, to coping with the crisis. 
The lending-to-companies scheme echoes similar moves made by the EIB after the financial crash more than a decade ago.
It is modelled in part on an existing offering described by the bank as ""intermediated loans"" made available to companies both very small and large to finance investments in their business.

1655,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 11, 2020 12:07PM ET</span>","Adidas sees $1.1 billion coronavirus hit to China sales, Puma warns on profit","By Emma Thomasson
BERLIN (Reuters) - German sportswear makers Adidas (DE:ADSGn) and Puma (DE:PUMG) warned on Wednesday of a major decline in sales in China due to the coronavirus and said while there were early signs of improvement there the impact had spread to other markets.
Shares in Adidas and Puma, already pummelled in the last few weeks, were down 10% and 3.2% respectively at 1509 GMT. Shares in market leader  Nike  (N:NKE), which also warned last month of an impact from the virus, were down 3%.
Adidas said it expected first-quarter sales to drop by up to 1 billion euros ($1.1 billion) in greater China, and overall to fall more than 10%, including a drop of about 100 million euros in Japan and South Korea.
Chief Executive Kasper Rorsted, noting that the higher-margin China business is usually a major contributor to profits, told analysts that group operating profit will fall by more than 500 million euros in the same period, 
Adidas and Puma make almost a third of their sales in Asia, which has been a major growth market for sporting goods in recent years. The region is also the main sourcing hub, with China a major producer for the industry.
""The virus hit looks worse than feared,"" Jefferies analyst James Grzinic wrote in a note on Adidas, adding that the news from Adidas and Puma pointed to the likelihood of major earnings downgrades for other retailers.
Puma said it no longer expected its business would return to normal soon, despite encouraging signs coming out of China, adding it was abandoning the 2020 guidance it gave on Feb. 19 that had assumed the crisis would be short-lived.
""Given the duration of the situation in China, the negative impact in other Asian countries and now also the spread to Europe and the U.S., we unfortunately have to conclude that a short-term normalization will not occur,"" it said.
Since emerging in China late last year, the new coronavirus has spread around the world, infecting around 120,000 people, killing nearly 4,300 and sending markets into a tailspin.
SPORTS EVENTS DISRUPTED
Sporting events around the world have been cancelled, postponed or played without spectators, with the virus's spread raising questions about the viability of the upcoming Olympic Games in Japan and Euro 2020 soccer championship.
While the Olympics is not usually a major driver of sales for the sporting goods industry, Euro 2020 is more important for sales of replica jerseys and balls.
If both events are postponed, Adidas could lose up to 70 million euros of sales, Rorsted told journalists, but added he was upbeat about the underlying health of the business and was not planning any job cuts.
Adidas, which last month warned its business in the greater China area had dropped by about 85% year-on-year in the period since China's Lunar New Year on Jan. 25, said about half of its 12,000 stores in China were open again.
But both companies noted a deterioration in markets such as Japan and South Korea, where Chinese tourists often travel to shop, and in Europe.
Adidas Finance chief Harm Ohlmeyer said he expects a return to normal in the second half of the year, adding that the company had not yet cut orders to factories. 
Adidas and Puma said most of their factories in China were operating again. Puma said its outbound logistics from China were also mostly in operation, so its global supply chain was only seeing some minor delays.
Excluding the impact from the virus, Adidas forecast currency-neutral sales to increase by between 6% and 8% for the full year and for its operating margin to rise by between 10.5% and 11.8%.
Fourth-quarter sales - covering a period before the coronavirus took hold - rose a currency-adjusted 10% to 5.84 billion euros, while operating profit came in at 245 million euros, missing analysts' mean forecasts.
Currency-neutral sales grew 18% in greater China, 10% in North America and 14% in Europe, the latter a big rebound from declines in the first half of 2019 after the firm took steps to reduce its reliance on its Originals fashion line.

Investing.com - Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) is calling for an end to the bull market that’s been running for more than a decade.
David Kostin, Goldman Sachs Resarch’s chief U.S. Equities strategist, said Wednesday stocks will enter a bear market by the middle of this year.  
“After 11 years, 13% annualized earnings growth and 16% annualized trough-to-peak appreciation, we believe the S&P 500 bull market will soon end,” Kostin wrote in a note. “The deterioration in fundamentals is visible.”
He predicts the S&P 500 will drop to 2,450 by mid-2020, which would be 28% down from its peak in February, constituting a bear market.
Earnings will be down 12% or more in each of the next two quarters as a dive in oil prices and disruption by Covid-19 continues to impact the economic landscape.
But Kostin isn’t pessimistic for long, saying that a new bull market will be “born later this year.""
His end target for the S&P is 3,200. It was trading around 2,770 midday."

(Reuters) -  Boeing Co  (N:BA) is planning to draw down the rest of a $13.8 billion loan it agreed last month, a source told Reuters on Wednesday, as the coronavirus outbreak adds to pressure on the U.S. plane-maker due to the grounding of its 737 MAX jets.
The source said that the company was taking the step because of overall market volatility and not due to the changing of the return to service date of its 737 MAX aircraft, which has been steadily pushed out and is now expected at earliest mid-year.
Boeing's shares fell as much as 11% to $205.56 on news of the loan drawdown, initially reported by Bloomberg News, broadly in line with a collapse in airline and other aerospace shares across the board.
The planemaker may draw down the money as early as Friday, the source said. 
Boeing had no immediate comment. 
U.S. companies have been rushing to borrow more money and boost their cash coffers this week, as market turmoil fueled by a plunge in oil prices and the coronavirus outbreak raised the prospect of an economic downturn.
Airlines have been among the worst hit, as a collapse in bookings and business travel forced radical cuts in flight schedules, capacity and annual results forecasts.
Boeing's total debt nearly doubled to $27.3 billion in 2019, as it compensated airlines and grappled with additional production costs for the 737 MAX even as the grounding prevented it from delivering the aircraft to buyers.
Media reported last month that the planemaker had raised a total of $13.825 billion in a fund raising round from lenders including Bank of China and PNC. Analysts estimated last year that the company was leaking around $1 billion monthly as a result of the MAX grounding. 
Boeing, which has seen orders collapse in the face of the MAX crisis, said separately on Wednesday that it won 18 new orders for wide-body planes in February although MAX cancellations meant overall it lost 28 orders last month.
The planemaker has been encouraging customers to swap the MAX for more expensive 787 or 777 planes, but analysts say the cuts in capacity by airlines may weaken any such demand.

Boeing, which has said it expects the 737 MAX to be recertified by the middle of this year, is also facing the possibility of additional delays after it failed to win the backing of U.S. aviation regulators earlier this week to leave wiring bundles in place on the grounded plane.

1659,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 11, 2020 11:36AM ET</span>",Deutsche Bank holds off repaying $1.25 billion of debt in volatile market,"By Abhinav Ramnarayan and Tom Sims
LONDON/FRANKFURT (Reuters) -  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) will delay repayment on $1.25 billion (966 million pounds) of bonds when they become redeemable next month, a rare move in the industry that could pave the way for other lenders to follow suit in a market shaken by the coronavirus outbreak.
With the appetite for risky debt severely hit by recent market volatility, Germany's biggest bank said on Wednesday it would hold on to $1.25 billion of so-called Additional Tier 1 (AT1) bonds rather than repay it.
AT1 bonds - more commonly known as a type of contingent convertible, or CoCo, bonds - are the most risky debt banks can issue. They are designed to be perpetual in nature, though banks can repay them after a specified period - in this case, Apr. 30.
It is usual for banks to repay them at the first opportunity rather than risk stoking speculation over their cash and solvency positions.
But this could change now given the recent blowout in CoCo debt after the coronavirus outbreak hampered risk sentiment and economic expectations. Deutsche Bank could be the first of many to take this option, according to analysts.
""If the market conditions persist like this, we may start seeing bank treasurers start to look at this option more and more,"" said Filippo Alloatti, senior credit analyst at Federated Hermes. ""I don't love it as an investor, but as long as there an economic justification for this and the chain of reasoning is clear, we can live with it.""
AT1 securities were designed in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis to try to ensure investors, rather than taxpayers, would be on the hook if a bank ran into financial difficulties.
Banks have almost always redeemed them at the first opportunity, though  Banco Santander  (MC:SAN) was one high-profile exception last year, though the Spanish lender did eventually repay bondholders.
""Because of the blowout in this market, there's a lot more expectations that borrowers will leave AT1s alone and not redeem them,"" said a banker who manages bond sales for European companies, including Deutsche Bank. ""It is much cheaper for them to hold on to it than to call it.""

1661,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 11, 2020 11:13AM ET</span>","Boeing scores widebody orders in February, MAX cancellations mount","By Rachit Vats and Eric M. Johnson
(Reuters) -  Boeing Co  (N:BA) said on Wednesday it took in 18 new orders for widebody planes in February but saw more customers cancel orders of its grounded and previously best-selling 737 MAX jet, as it faced another blow to demand from the coronavirus outbreak.
The U.S. planemaker, which had failed to secure any order in January for the first time in decades, said some customers swapped 737 MAX orders in favor of more expensive wide-body planes.
Boeing had received 49 new orders in the first two months of 2019.
The company, struggling with a crisis that started a year ago following the second of two fatal crashes involving the 737 MAX, said it delivered just 30 planes to customers in the first two months, down from 95 a year ago.
The aviation industry is also facing fresh disruptions as the fast-spreading coronavirus outbreak cripples air travel, with airlines seeking to postpone aircraft deliveries and cash downpayments to Boeing and rival Airbus SE (PA:AIR).
U.S. airlines on Tuesday ditched 2020 forecasts and unveiled significant capacity cuts and cost-saving measures, with Chicago-based United Airlines (O:UAL) warning it could take 18 months for demand to recover.
Airbus failed to secure any new aircraft orders in February.
After an accounting adjustment representing jets ordered in previous years but now unlikely to be delivered, Boeing's net total for orders in February sank to a negative 28 airplanes.
The orders included what Boeing called a ""conversion"" by  Air Lease Corp  (N:AL) of nine MAX orders into three 787s, reflecting greater demand from airlines for the wide-body 787.
Oman Air converted 10 737 MAXs into four 787s, while Boeing attributed one 767 for  Fedex Corp  (N:FDX) and 10 787s to ""unidentified customers"".
Air Canada and Japan Investment Advisors canceled 11 and 10 MAXs planes, respectively, from the order book."

(Reuters) - PepsiCo Inc (O:PEP) on Wednesday made its biggest bet in the energy drinks market with a $3.85 billion deal to buy Rockstar Energy Beverages, opening a new front in its long-running battle with  Coca-Cola Co  (N:KO).
The deal is also the latest move by PepsiCo's new chief executive officer, Ramon Laguarta, to reduce the company's dependence on its core sugary drinks and salty snacks, which have been increasingly shunned by health-conscious consumers.
Pepsi last July announced the acquisition of South African maker of cereal and fruit juice Pioneer Food Group, a few months after closing its $3.2 billion buyout of carbonated drink-machine maker SodaStream.
The Rockstar deal comes about two months after Coca-Cola, which owns a stake in  Monster Beverage  Co (O:MNST), rolled out Coke-branded energy drinks in the United States, after launching in European markets last year.
PepsiCo, which already distributes Rockstar products in some markets, has a smaller presence in the energy space with its Mountain Dew Kickstart and Mountain Dew Game Fuel brands.
""With Rockstar underneath their wings, they'll have a family of energy drinks... they can coordinate the activity of an entire family of brands to meet a variety of needs of people,"" Edward Jones analyst John Boylan said.
Laguarta has previously said the company was looking to expand its presence in the caffeinated beverages market, as longer working hours in the United States was helping increase demand for a quick energy fix.
Spending by consumers globally on energy drinks rose 9.9% to $12.72 billion for the year ended February 2020, compared with a 2.6% increase in sales of soft drinks to $26.96 billion, according to market research firm Nielsen.
 Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) analyst Kaumil Gajrawala said PepsiCo's previous distribution deal with Rockstar limited its ability to participate more meaningfully in the energy drink category.
Founded in 2001, Las Vegas-based Rockstar initially aimed straight for major player Red Bull, by having a wider variety of flavors and selling cans twice as big for the same price.
However, the brand, whose bright yellow logo can be seen on extreme sports teams and at music festivals, still remains far behind the Austrian giant, as well as Monster.
Monster and Red Bull, together accounted for over a third of the global energy drink market in 2019, according to data from Euromonitor International.
Pepsi said the deal is not expected to impact its revenue or earnings per share in 2020.

1671,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 11, 2020 10:10AM ET</span>",Goldman Manager Says Virus Hit May Be Worse Than Market Expects,"(Bloomberg) --
A  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). asset manager who correctly predicted last year’s rally in stocks says the equity market is overly complacent about the possible damage from the coronavirus and could face more declines.
“We don’t think the stock market has priced in the worst outcome of the virus as containment measures may continue to extend, reflecting what we’ve seen in China and Italy,” Shoqat Bunglawala, who heads the global portfolio solutions group for Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Asia Pacific at Goldman Sachs Asset Management, said in an interview. “So we recognize there are still downside risks from here.”
Goldman’s global portfolio solutions group cut its exposure to global equities to neutral from overweight in recent weeks as the virus quickly spread outside China, hitting Europe and the U.S., threatening global growth and crimping earnings. The investment unit is keeping its overweight position in fixed income and allocating to such alternative strategies as trend-following, taking a long position in rates and a short position in stocks.
The $1 trillion fund manager is the latest among major investors and strategists to turn cautious on risk assets in the face of growing uncertainty. While the combination of coronavirus fears and an oil price war has wiped out as much as $11 trillion from the MSCI All-Country World Index, equities are coming down from record highs and U.S. stock valuations are still above their historical average. This is making some market players worried that more losses are possible.
“Essentially, we’re getting a shock to profits and we entered this period when valuations were already quite high,” said Bunglawala. “If this virus continues to spread and containment measures are prolonged and extend further, that’s clearly going to have more of an impact on global growth and earnings.”
Major companies, including Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)., BASF SE (DE:BASFN) and Adidas AG (DE:ADSGN), have warned about the profit hit as a lockdown in Italy and canceled flights across the world hurt sectors such as luxury and travel. Goldman now expects earnings per share growth in the U.S. to be zero to 2% this year and forecasts an EPS contraction of 6% for Europe.
Bunglawala says that economic data are going to be too delayed to reflect the full extent of damage from the epidemic, so it’s very important to track other factors, such as the speed of the spread of the virus, containment measures and signs of stress in financial markets.
Anticipation is rising for global monetary and fiscal officials to step up their support for the economy, and the U.S. Federal Reserve and Bank of England have already cut interest rates. However, according to Bunglawala, the already low rates limit the scope of potential monetary responses and government leaders might need to come up with their own fiscal measures.
U.S. President Donald Trump is currently pursuing an economic stimulus plan, which may include a payroll tax holiday. Meanwhile, Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte’s government is ready to spend as much as 25 billion euros ($28.3 billion) on stimulus measures and the U.K. on Wednesday announced total fiscal stimulus of 30 billion pounds ($39 billion).
While Goldman Sachs Asset Management’s global portfolio solutions group is currently cautious on equities, it is monitoring the virus outbreak and the market for entry points.
“If we see a stabilization in the spread of the virus, we could move from defensive positioning and take advantage of tactical opportunities,” Bunglawala said."

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets fell again at the open on Wednesday amid concerns about delays in the U.S. government and Congress agreeing stimulus measures to support the economy in the face of a spreading coronavirus outbreak. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average initially fell 700 points, and by 9:37 AM ET (1337 GMT) had recovered marginally to be down 608 points, or 2.4%, while the S&P 500 was also down 2.4% and the Nasdaq Composite was down 2.0%
All three major indices had risen nearly 5% on Tuesday in anticipation of President Donald Trump's promised stimulus package. Trump had failed to present his promised measures after the close of trading on Tuesday, after flagging what he said would be a “very major” package a day earlier.
Instead, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi reportedly begun talks on what would amount to a bipartisan package of measures, which Senate Leader Mitch McConnell said his party would likely support.
The stop-start nature of the U.S. response has made it appear unfocused by comparison with the likes of China, where government authority is not constrained by democratic checks and balances.
European governments have meanwhile begun taking more and more drastic steps to support their economies, with the U.K. announcing a combined fiscal and monetary stimulus package on Wednesday and Italy signalling over 16 billion euros ($17.8 billion) in new measures. 
 Among individual stocks, PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) stock fell 3.0% after agreeing to buy energy drink maker Rockstar for $3.5 billion up front in cash, with further conditional payments over the next 15 years. 
Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) stock fell another 3.1% as crude oil prices slid further in response to signs of Saudi Arabia ramping up output even as global demand falls due to the coronavirus. 
Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) stock fell 4.2% after a report saying it may suspend the accounts of drivers who test positive for, or come into contact with, the coronavirus - a move that may lead to hefty compensation payments. 
 Nike  (NYSE:NKE) stock fell 5.4% after German rival Adidas (DE:ADSGN) warned of a 1 billion-euro hit to sales in the first quarter due to the virus. Adidas ADRs (OTC:ADDYY) were down 12.8%.

Investing.com - U.S. stock futures pointed to a sharply lower open on Wednesday after strong gains in the previous session, amid doubts over what U.S. President Donald Trump said would be “major” fiscal stimulus measures to counter the economic impact of the coronavirus outbreak.
By 07:50 AM ET (1150 GMT), Dow futures dropped 632 points, or around 2.5%. S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq 100 futures were both down around 2.6%. 
Wall Street reversed course on Tuesday, with the three main indexes all rising by nearly 5%  in anticipation of a major policy announcement. That pulled them back from the brink of a bear market.
But while Trump met with fellow Republicans in the U.S. Senate on Tuesday, he did not outline any measures to offset the economic fallout from the virus outbreak. A scheduled news conference took place without the President.
Futures received only a temporary lift from the Bank of England, which earlier joined other central banks in cutting interest rates, as part of a broader package of measures to support bank lending in order to cushion the economy.
With the Federal Reserve having already cut rates this month, the pressure is on the European Central Bank to act when it meets on Thursday.
Benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury yields were down 4 basis points to 0.71%, more than double Monday's record low yield of 0.32%.
Market participants largely expect the Fed to cut interest rates for the second time this month at the conclusion of next week's regularly scheduled policy meeting, after it surprised investors last week with a 50-basis-point cut.
Elsewhere, crude oil futures turned lower again after Saudi Arabia ratcheted up its price war, asking national oil company Aramco (SE:2222) to increase its production capacity to 13 million barrels a day from 12 million currently. U.S. crude futures were down 2.9% at $33.37, while Brent was down 2.5% at $36.28 a barrel.

""As a result of taking these actions the company will, where necessary, make temporary closures of its plants across Italy,"" it said.
The spokesman said affected plants were Pomigliano, Melfi, Atessa and Cassino, each of them halted for two or three days between Wednesday and Saturday.
FCA said that to allow greater spacing of employees at their workstations, ""daily production rates will be lowered to accommodate the adapted manufacturing processes"".
However, a source close to the matter said FCA did not expect an impact on overall production rates.
The source added that temporary closures were in no way linked to disruptions of auto parts supplies following anti-virus measures imposed by Rome all over Italy."

LONDON (Reuters) - European stocks rose on Wednesday after the Bank of England joined other central banks in cutting interest rates, raising hopes for more co-ordinated monetary and fiscal stimulus to counter the economic shock from the coronavirus outbreak.
The surprise move from the BoE which - on the day that Britain's budget is set to open the taps on spending - also announced measures to support bank lending, lifted shares after a lacklustre session in Asia.
Wall Street had rallied significantly on Tuesday, helping reverse some of Monday's brutal losses, but that failed to translate into improved sentiment on Wednesday as scepticism grew about the stimulus package announced by Washington to fight the epidemic.
By 0855 GMT, the FTSE 100 had risen 1.73%, the Euro Stoxx was 2.67% ahead and Germany's DAX was 2.65% higher.
U.S. stock futures were down 1.2%, although that was up from the 3% losses before the BoE's 50-basis-point cut in the base rate to 0.25%. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 1.05%.
With the Federal Reserve having already cut rates this month, the pressure is on the European Central Bank to act when it meets on Thursday.
The BoE did not announce any new quantitative easing but it did launch a new scheme to support lending to small businesses. The UK finance minister is due to present his first annual budget shortly after 1230 GMT.
""It is the only thing central banks can do in a public health crisis,"" Neil Dwane global strategist and portfolio manager at Allianz (DE:ALVG) Global Investors. ""They are trying to take the shackles off the banks to ensure we don't get a cash crunch.""

1679,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 11, 2020 05:20AM ET</span>",StockBeat: Adidas Plummets After Grim China Sales Update,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- Sportswear company Adidas (DE:ADSGN) fell to the bottom of the German DAX on Wednesday after revealing the scale of the impact it’s facing from the coronavirus.
In what’s becoming a pattern, the company was unable to say how badly it expected this year’s business to be hurt by an outbreak. And understandably so, given that the European soccer championships and the summer Olympic games – both of which traditionally give a significant boost to sales – may be disrupted by the disease.
Adidas stock fell 6.0% at opening, before recovering to be down only 5.2% by 4:15 AM ET (0915 GMT). The DAX was up 1.9% in line with other European markets as the Bank of England’s emergency rate cut and loosening of prudential policy strengthened belief in a coordinated global policy response to the economic impact of the crisis. The Stoxx 600 and U.K. FTSE 100 were up 1.2%.
As with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), another company that was unable to say how bad things would get in the first quarter, Adidas has a two-fold problem: China, where the outbreak began and which implemented the most drastic quarantining measures to stop the disease, is both a major market and a key part of its supply chain.
Sales in Greater China were down by anything between 800 million and 1 billion euros from a year earlier in the first two months of the year, the company said in an update on Wednesday. That alone translates into a hit of between 400 million and 500 million euros on operating profit.
“In addition, the company has started to observe traffic declines with a corresponding negative business impact in Japan and South Korea,” it added, without providing further details.
That is causing some big problems in inventory management, raising the risks of discounting later in the year. The company said it canceled all shipments in February and faces “a significant amount of product takebacks, which the company plans to clear through its own channels throughout the remainder of the year.”
On the plus side, Adidas said most of its factories in China are operational again and added that its global sourcing activities have not been hit yet.
Adidas’ stock was arguably riding for a fall, after rising relentlessly over the last year in the face of economic slowdowns in both China and Europe, its most important market. Even after falling by one-third from its January peak, the shares are still not cheap at 24.7 times trailing earnings, although a strong secular outlook for sportswear, a powerful brand and one of the continent’s most respected CEOs in Kasper Rorsted all argue for a premium valuation.
Rorsted told Bloomberg TV with refreshing honesty that he doesn’t expect sports gear to be at the top of people’s priorities as they emerge from quarantine, and that, as such, he expects the recovery to take “some time.”
The company said Wednesday it delivered a 6% rise in currency-adjusted sales and a 12% increase in net profit in 2019. Its baseline expectation for this year – not factoring in Covid-19 is a sales increase of between 6% and 8%.  The stock has now priced in a sizeable uncertainty discount. If the world can get the virus under control in time for the key summer sports events, this may represent a rare opportunity to get exposure at an acceptable price."

Investing.com -- Europe’s stock markets opened higher on Wednesday, after the Bank of England announced an emergency half-point interest rate cut and other measures, strengthening hopes of a coordinated policy response to tackle the economic impact of the coronavirus outbreak.
The Bank of England’s measures turned markets round, reversing premarket losses as Europe prepared to follow the after-hours move in U.S. stocks.
U.S. indices had reversed after President Donald Trump failed to show up to a scheduled press conference where he was expected to unveil a raft of supportive fiscal policy measures.
By 3:10 AM ET, (0810 GMT), the benchmark Stoxx 600 was up 1.1% to 340.78. The U.K. FTSE 100 was up 1.7% and the German DAX was up 1.4%.
The BoE had also announced a new lending scheme targeted at helping small and medium-sized enterprises and waived its 1% countercyclical capital buffer, a move that will allow banks to run temporarily with lower levels of capital and reduce the need for them to restrict lending to the real economy.
Royal Bank of Scotland (LON:RBS) was the biggest gainer from the measures, rising 2.2%. HSBC shares 1.8% while  Barclays  (LON:BARC) shares rose 1.0%.
Elsewhere, Adidas (DE:ADSGN) stock opened down 6.0% after the sportswear maker said it expects a 1 billion-euro hit to revenue in the first quarter due to the coronavirus. It said Chinese sales were down by over 80% in the first two months of the year and CEO Kaper Rorsted told Bloomberg TV that he expects the recovery to take some time, as sports gear is unlikely to be top of consumers’ list of priorities as they emerge from quarantine.
In other markets, crude oil edged lower after  Saudi Aramco  (SE:2222) said it had been instructed by the government to raise its output capacity to 13 million barrels a day. The company had said on Tuesday that it expects to pump more than 12 million b/d from April, up over 2 million b/d from previous output levels. Brent crude futures were down 0.4% at $37.08 a barrel."

Contracts on the S&P 500 Index fell more than 2% after the U.S. administration failed to offer details on what President Donald Trump said would be “major” measures to combat the economic impact of the coronavirus. European futures rose after the near 5% rally on Wall Street Tuesday. Asian equities fell, while the yen surged and crude oil held most of Tuesday’s rebound.
The pound reversed an earlier gain to edge lower after the Bank of England cut interest rates.
Australia joined peers from Japan to Brazil to Italy that have sunk into a bear market this month.
“We saw a relief rally yesterday that just hasn’t been sustainable,” Kerry Craig, global market strategist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Asset Management in Melbourne, told Bloomberg TV.

1683,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 11, 2020 03:10AM ET</span>",Japan Inc tightens wage purse strings as coronavirus clouds gather,"By Tetsushi Kajimoto and Naomi Tajitsu
TOKYO (Reuters) - Against the backdrop of the coronavirus epidemic and a looming global economic slowdown, major Japanese firms are tightening their belts in influential annual wage deals that were hammered out with unions on Wednesday.
Setting the tone, bellwether Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203) said on Wednesday it had agreed to give workers an average monthly pay raise that's 20% lower than last year's hike. What's more, base pay will not rise for the first time in seven years.
Major steelmakers followed suit and shelved base pay hikes, threatening Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's lofty goal of generating a self-sustaining growth cycle - a key plank of his 'Abenomics' policies to stimulate the world's third-biggest economy.
Over the past six years, major firms raised wages more than 2% each spring as Abe pressured businesses to boost pay to put an end to deflation and stagnation that has dogged Japan for two decades.
BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda has said he would closely watch the outcome of the wage talks for a clue to gauge the price trend, as the central bank may expand monetary stimulus next week to counter the fallout from the spread of the coronavirus.
""Substantial wage increases cannot be expected in 2020 as base pay won't rise much,"" said Yoshiyuki Suimon, senior economist at Nomura Securities. He was referring to base pay hikes, which determine regular pay that accounts for most of monthly salary.
NO BASE PAY HIKE
Rather then lifting base pay, Toyota agreed to an average rise of 8,600 yen ($82.31) per month for all employees, a portion of which will be invested in steps to enable workers to advance their careers such as work experience in other sections and regions.
The average increase in the fiscal year starting April compared with last year's 10,700 yen raise.
""Any negative impact to our current situation could have a significant impact on our workforce,” Masanori Kuwata, Toyota's deputy chief human resources officer, told reporters after reaching the agreement with its union.
""Because of this, we opted to forgo raising base salaries this year,"" Kuwata said, adding that Toyota's base salaries are already among the highest in Japan.
Japanese major steelmakers - Nippon Steel (T:5401), JFE Steel, a unit of JFE Holdings (T:5411) and Kobe Steel Ltd (T:5406) - said they agreed with unions to freeze base pay raises for two years from fiscal 2020, the Nikkei business daily said. It marks the first time these firms have not hiked wages.
""Companies are turning cautious about base pay hikes as the new virus outbreak will exacerbate declines in profits,"" said Koya Miyamae, a senior economist at SMBC Nikko Securities.
""As the virus outbreak deepens, labour unions are also losing momentum towards base pay hikes, and both manufacturers and non-manufacturers become half-hearted about wage hikes.""
FIXED COSTS
With the economy already teetering on the brink of a recession, Japanese firms have become wary about wage hikes that commit them to higher fixed costs.
Companies have begun to take a varied approach, with more withholding blanket pay hikes and shifting to merit-based wages rather than seniority-oriented pay in an effort to attract young and skilled workers, while restraining wages for the middle-aged and older employees.
Wage strategies have also been affecting by diversification in Japan's work structure.
About 40% of workers are now lower-paid part-time staff and contract workers - double the proportion seen in 1990, just before the Japan's asset bubble burst, ushering in deflation.
The growing army of low-paid workers has led unions to prioritise addressing the income gap between permanent employees and others, rather than broad uniform pay raises."

Business travel to Asia has been the worst hit, with at least three out of every four companies reporting they have canceled or suspended all or most business trips to China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and other Asia-Pacific countries, according to a survey by Global Business Travel Association (GBTA).
The industry group's latest estimate is sharply above its February forecast of a $560 billion hit.
The fast-spreading virus, which originated in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, has killed more than 4,000 people, mostly in China, while disrupting businesses globally. 
""Coronavirus is significantly impacting the business travel industry's bottom line,"" GBTA Chief Operating Officer Scott Solombrino said in a statement. 
""The impact to the business travel industry – and to the broader economy – cannot be underestimated.""
China, which has seen a 95% drop in business travel since the outbreak, is expected to lose $404.1 billion in revenue from corporate travel, followed by $190.5 billion in loss for Europe.
Airline and hotel industries, which typically are the biggest beneficiaries of corporate spending, have taken a major hit to their revenue as the virus continues to spread, the industry group said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Major banks are at risk of losing billions of dollars of fee-based retail revenue as they face increased regulatory pressure and growing competition from new entrants offering no-fee services, Accenture Plc (N:ACN) said on Wednesday.
Revenues derived by banks across 12 markets globally through overdraft fees or other charges for services like cross-border payments and foreign transactions will erode on average by 5% over the next three to five years, it said in a study.
The research is based on quantitative analysis of banks' revenue pools in 12 countries, including the United States, United Kingdom, Australia and Hong Kong and a survey of nearly 15,000 bank customers.
It comes as tech-savvy start-ups seek to secure market share from big banks by offering a wide range of financial services, including checking accounts and international money transfers with lower or no fees.
In the United States, for example, digital bank Chime offers fee-free overdrafts for up to $100, while London-based Revolut allows users to transfer money abroad at the interbank exchange rate.
""These players are acting as a catalyst to force the industry to change,"" said Alan McIntyre, global head of Accenture's banking practice. Banks will not be able to be as reliant on non-transparent fee-based revenues as they have been doing in the past, he added.
The report also said banks' revenues may shrink because regulators are starting to mandate simpler fee structures to protect consumers.
The study suggests that banks make use of technology such as artificial intelligence and predictive analytics to gain more of their customers' trust and capture more revenue growth.

For example, banks could use predictive analytics to provide advice on which payment option would generate more rewards, it said. More than half of the consumers surveyed said they would pay fees for relevant add-on services from their bank.

1687,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 11, 2020 02:10AM ET</span>","Air freight rates skyrocket amid passenger flight cuts, Chinese factory restarts","By Lisa Baertlein and David Kirton
LOS ANGELES/SHENZHEN (Reuters) - Air freight rates are skyrocketing after the grounding of many passenger flights in Asia has left shippers scrambling to book limited spots on cargo planes as Chinese industrial production restarts, according to industry insiders.
About half of the air cargo carried worldwide normally flies in the belly of passenger jets rather than in dedicated freighters. But deep flight cuts in response to the coronavirus outbreak have made the market more dependent on freight haulers.
Freight forwarder Agility Logistics said on its website that China's air cargo capacity was down 39% in February relative to last year because of the passenger flight cuts. 
Shippers wishing to rush products out of China by air face sticker shock, said Refael Elbaz, chief executive of Israel-based Unicargo, which specializes in freight forwarding for Amazon.com sellers. 
""The price is three times higher – at least - because there is just no capacity,"" Elbaz said. 
Freight Investor Services said in an update to clients on Monday that cargo pricing on China-to-U.S. routes had reached ""abnormal highs"" and that intra-Asia traffic was up by 22% over the previous week. TAC Index data shows China-U.S. cargo rates have risen by 27% over the last two weeks to $3.50 a kilogram.
The price surge will benefit freight haulers and help cargo-heavy Asian airlines like Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd (HK:0293),  Korean Air Lines Co  Ltd (KS:003490) and Japan's ANA Holdings Inc (T:9202) offset some of the steep revenue losses from halting many of their passenger flights.
Chris Mu, who runs a small logistics company in Shenzhen, China, that often uses air transport to supply Amazon (O:AMZN) sellers in Europe and to transport UK-made car parts for assembly in China, said prices had tripled since before the Lunar New Year and are rising by the hour. 
""With reduced options, we have to take whatever we can get, flying goods from the UK to the Netherlands, then from Liege in Belgium to Nanchang in Jiangxi province, just to get them to a factory in Shanghai,"" Mu said. ""For the airlines, it's fine because they're still making money, but it's the middlemen like us who are bearing the costs, and we don't like to go to our customers every day and tell them the price has gone up.""
DHL's express volumes have started to recover in China and the company is putting planes back into the network,  Deutsche Post  AG (DE:DPWGn) finance chief Melanie Kreis said on Tuesday, noting that its fleet is a major asset given the grounding of many passenger planes.
In mainland China, the number of freighter arrivals has increased in recent weeks as factories resumed production. China's aviation regulator said the number of freighter flights was expected to reach 870 this week, up from 788 in the week starting Feb. 17.
""The number of air charter requests we've gotten in the past week are more than the number we've received in a normal quarter,"" said Brian Bourke, chief growth officer at SEKO Logistics, a Chicago-based freight forwarder. 
Most of those requests involved moving goods from China to the United States, he said.

1690,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 11, 2020 12:41AM ET</span>",Tesla on the Hunt for Cybertruck Plant Location in Central U.S.,"(Bloomberg) -- Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc. will build its in-development Cybertruck at a new plant in the U.S., Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk tweeted Tuesday, likely triggering a state-by-state competition similar to one he set off six years ago.
The factory will build both the electric pickup and the Model Y crossover for customers on the East Coast, the chief executive officer wrote. He didn’t elaborate on which states Tesla is considering beyond saying Tesla will pick a location in the central U.S.
Musk unveiled the Cybertruck in November and positioned it as a radically different option for buyers of pickups, a highly lucrative segment dominated by Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co., General Motors Co (NYSE:GM). and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV. A botched demo in which Tesla’s design chief cracked supposedly shatter-proof glass generated enormous buzz and prompted the company to sell T-shirts featuring the broken windows.
By publicizing Tesla’s plans to construct a factory for the truck slated for production late next year, Musk, 48, is repeating a strategy used in 2014 to score a $1.3 billion incentive package from Nevada. The state lured the company’s massive battery factory there after Musk held a bake-off in which Arizona, California, New Mexico and Texas were the finalists that came up short.

States with right-to-work laws that prohibit unions from requiring prospective hires to join their membership are likely going to be contenders for Tesla’s facility, said John Boyd, principal of a manufacturing site-selection firm based in Princeton, New Jersey.
“I’d put Tennessee, Indiana, Kentucky, Texas and Michigan on the list,” Boyd said. “This will be a trophy project for the automotive sector.”
Government incentives will play a role in Tesla’s decision-making, along with logistics costs, access to big, talented workforces, and quality of life, Musk told the Wall Street Journal in an email. TechCrunch reported the company is in talks with officials in Nashville, Tennessee, citing a source familiar with the discussions.
Tesla fell 3% after the close Tuesday, though the late trading session ended before his tweets. The stock has surged 54% this year.
The likely battle between states will play out as U.S. President Donald Trump, who’s vowed to revive the American auto industry, probably will face off against Joe Biden, the vice president in the Obama administration, which backed General Motors and Chrysler through their 2009 bankruptcies.
Trump praised Musk in an interview with CNBC in January, calling the South Africa-born CEO “one of our great geniuses” and predicting he would build “a very big plant in the United States.”
Tesla recently completed construction of its newest plant in China and started delivering locally assembled Model 3 sedans to consumers in January. It’s also planning a factory near Berlin.

Last month, Musk hinted that Tesla could build a factory in Texas. The Texas Enterprise Fund, created by the state’s legislature under former Governor Rick Perry, has become one of the largest payers of economic-development incentives in the nation.
Texas offered $2.3 million to entice SpaceX, the rocket company Musk founded and runs, to locate a launch facility in Brownsville, on the Gulf Coast near the Mexican border. Tesla’s chip team is based both in Palo Alto, California, where the carmaker is headquartered, and in Austin, Texas.
The company’s sole U.S. auto-assembly plant is in Fremont, California, which makes the Model S, X and 3 and has begun producing the Model Y crossover.

In a commentary published by Real Clear Politics, Senators Roger Wicker of Mississippi and Lamar Alexander and Marsha Blackburn from Tennessee criticized the treatment by Japanese authorities of former Nissan Motor Co. director Greg Kelly, who was temporarily jailed in solitary confinement and has been unable to leave the country while awaiting trial.
“His predicament is a cautionary tale for Americans thinking about working in Japan, raising serious questions about whether non-Japanese executives can comfortably work in Japan under its legal system,” the three Republicans wrote Tuesday. “If Americans and other non-Japanese executives question their ability to be treated fairly in Japan, then that most important bilateral relationship in the world is at risk.”
The senators represent the two states where Nissan has vehicle assembly plants in the U.S. and Tennessee also is home to the Japanese carmaker’s North American headquarters. A representative for the U.S. State Department didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.
Kelly and his family have questioned his ability to get a fair trial in Japan, where he’s been prohibited from leaving since late 2018. Without the testimony of former Nissan Chairman Carlos Ghosn, who fled the country late last year, Kelly fears he may not be able to fully defend himself against prosecutors’ allegations that he violated Japanese financial laws.
Tokyo officials have defended Japan’s judicial practices, saying they’re comparable to systems in Europe and the U.S. Japanese prosecutors allege Kelly conspired with Ghosn to hide the former chairman’s deferred compensation, a charge he has denied.
Kelly’s trial is not expected to begin until sometime this summer, roughly 18 months after he was charged, his son, Kevin Kelly, wrote in a blog post on Monday. The elder Kelly was released on 70 million yen ($666,000) bail in December 2018, a month after being jailed shortly after arriving in Japan for a Nissan board meeting.
Kelly agreed to a $100,000 penalty and five-year suspension from serving as a corporate officer in September as part of a settlement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, without admitting or denying the agency’s findings. He had been charged with helping fraudulently conceal over $140 million in compensation and retirement benefits on behalf of his former boss."

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian banks are well capitalized to withstand the disruption caused to financial markets from the coronavirus outbreak, a senior central banker said on Wednesday as the country's banks met with the Treasurer.
Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) Deputy Governor Guy Debelle said the country's lenders had boosted their finances before the recent disruption in wholesale funding markets and their deposit inflows were ""robust"" as well.
""They are resilient to a period of market disruption,"" Debelle said in a speech in Sydney.
The comment comes amid fears Australia is on track for its first recession in nearly three decades. Regulators are worried the coronavirus epidemic, which has plunged major stock indexes into bear territory and disrupted money markets, could have a ripple effect across the financial system.
A sharp and rapid fall in stock markets and widening credit spreads would put indebted firms under severe pressure, in turn leading to potential defaults and a rise in bad loans for banks.
Treasurer Josh Frydenberg did not immediately provide details of his meeting with the chief executives of 13 of the country's biggest banks.
Shares in the Big Four banks -- Commonwealth Bank (AX:CBA), Westpac (AX:WBC), National Australia Bank (AX:NAB) and ANZ Banking Group (AX:ANZ) -- have dived between 15% and 22% since the beginning of February when the virus began spreading outside China. But regulators and the banks themselves are confident the sector is prepared for a shock after lenders bolstered their core tier-I capital ratios to a minimum 10.5% from January.
Australian Banking Association CEO Anna Bligh said the country's lenders were in ""the best ever shape to face this challenge.""
Debelle said the RBA has not seen ""any particular sign"" of pressure in its daily market operations to date.
In addition, Debelle noted that while the spread between the bank bill swap rate - a benchmark used to price loans and other products - and the expected policy rate has risen in recent days, it remains low.
""Nothing at all like what occurred in GFC,"" Debelle said, referring to the 2008 global financial crisis.
The coronavirus has spread rapidly in recent weeks, infecting more than 116,100 people worldwide and killing more than 4,000, according to a Reuters tally.
The RBA last week cut its benchmark rate to a record low 0.5%. Financial futures are pricing in another easing to 0.25% as soon as next month, another factor pressuring bank earnings and profit margins."

HONG KONG (Reuters) -  Citigroup  (N:C) has hired Loretta Ko to return to the investment bank and head its financial institutions group (FIG) for Hong Kong, the bank said on Wednesday.
Ko was most recently at  Banco Santander  (MC:SAN), where she held the same position that she will take on at the U.S. investment bank.
She has previously worked for ANZ (AX:ANZ) and  Standard Chartered  (L:STAN) in Hong Kong, according to the announcement to staff that was also sent to Reuters.
Ko spent 15 years with Citigroup between 1989 and 2004, according to her LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) profile.
In the announcement, Citigroup's Valentin Garger and Joy Cheng said the hiring should help the bank grow its market share in FIG transactions.
""Hong Kong financial institutions (group) is a significant and growing part of Corporate Banking in the country as well as a critical contributor to the broader Asia Pacific financial institutions franchise,"" it said.
Citigroup is aiming to have women account globally for at least 40% of their assistant vice president to managing director levels by the end of 2021.
In Asia, that level currently sits at 39%, according to a Citigroup spokesman.
Citigroup promoted 14 women, or 31% out of a total 45 managing directors named in Asia at the end of 2019, up from eight women the previous year, according to the spokesman."

Investing.com - Asian markets gave up some of their gains on Wednesday from a rebound a day earlier, despite the possibility of the U.S. rolling out a package of support measures. 
 
China’s Shanghai Composite was the only major market in the region trading higher, up 0.30% by 11:30 PM ET (3:30 AM GMT), but the tech-heavy Shenzhen Component was down by 0.39%. 
 
Australia’s ASX 200 was down 2.33% while Japan’s Nikkei 225 declined by 1.01% and South Korea’s KOSPI lost 1.26%.
 
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index gave up early gains and was trading down 0.21%. 
 
Asian stocks rebounded Tuesday after a big global sell-off Monday sparked by a crash in oil prices and fears of the impact of COVID-19. While Wall Street’s rebound continued on Tuesday, Asian markets were trading mostly in the red. 
 
Wall Street appeared to get momentum from expectations that U.S. President Donald Trump would soon announce details of a package of measures to deal with the impact of the spread of the coronavirus and the oil price crash. As of Tuesday, the number of COVID-19 deaths around the world topped 4,000, according to the World Health Organization. 
Trump had been expected to hold a press conference on Tuesday but that event did not happen, briefly forcing a downturn in U.S. markets, which briefly gave up most of their gains.
 
“We were promised something substantive from the Trump administration, and if it hasn’t come yet at this hour, then it looks like it is being delayed. That’s why markets have a negative tone,” Michael McCarthy, chief market strategist at CMC Markets told Reuters in the afternoon. “From a global investor’s perspective, there are still a lot of downside risks.”
 
Still, during a meeting with Republican senators, Trump did propose a series of measures including payroll tax cuts, relief measures targeting specific industries like tourism and hospitality, and support for hourly workers that miss work. On Wall Street Tuesday, the Dow 30 finished the Tuesday session up 4.89% and the S&P500 finished up 4.94% while Nasdaq closed up 4.95%. 
 
“It’s market March Madness at the moment, complete with surprising losses, upsets, and comebacks,” Mike Loewengart, managing director of investment strategy at E*Trade Financial told Bloomberg."

The companies informed Oi's financial advisor Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) of their interest in starting negotiations for a potential acquisition of all or part of the carrier that filed for the largest-ever bankruptcy in Latin America in 2016.
If their bid is successful, the two companies would divide up the Oi business, the filings showed.
Telefonica, the Brazilian subsidiary of Spain's Telefonica SA (MC:TEF), operates Brazil's largest wireless carrier. TIM, which is controlled by  Telecom Italia  SpA (MI:TLIT), said it had informed its board of directors of their approach.
Oi said in a separate filing that the move, which it described as ""sounding out the market,"" showed that there was market interest in its wireless operations.
In September, Reuters reported that Oi was in talks with the two firms to sell assets and avoid insolvency.
Executives from all three major carriers in Brazil - Telefonica Brasil, TIM and America Movil SAB de CV's (MX:AMXL) Claro - said at the time they could consider a deal with Oi."

1698,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 10, 2020 08:06PM ET</span>",Investors hit pockets of illiquidity in U.S. Treasuries as yields drop to record lows,"By Karen Brettell and Abhinav Ramnarayan
(Reuters) - Some investors are growing increasingly concerned about liquidity disruptions in the more than $500 billion-a-day U.S. Treasury market, as volatility in the face of a spreading coronavirus outbreak and gyrating oil prices fuels massive shifts in yields.
Depth in the market for 10-year U.S. Treasurys - a measure of open orders - hit its lowest level since the financial crisis on Monday, analysts at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) said in a note to clients.
Investors say that some 30-year bonds also traded with unusually wide spreads to buy and sell the debt, making it more difficult and expensive to complete transactions. In some cases, they were not able to find a price for the bond at all.
“I've been in fixed income markets going back to 1987 and it's a very, very rare event that you struggle to get an active price in the long (U.S. Treasury) bond at any time,” said Gary Kirk, founding partner and portfolio manager at TwentyFour Asset Management.
Kirk said he tried two large counterparties before managing to get a satisfactory price during a recent transaction. ""It was a significant struggle,"" he said.
JPMorgan noted that liquidity during European and Asian hours has been even worse than during the U.S. day.
Market participants attributed some of the liquidity gaps to banks and computer-driven trading programs paring back their trading or limiting the size of their trades due to the volatility in markets.
Fears over the economic impact of the spreading coronavirus and a plunge in oil prices have driven investors into Treasuries - a popular haven asset - dragging yields to record lows. Bond yields fall when prices rise.
Tom di Galoma, managing director at Seaport Global Holdings, said the pockets of illiquidity are partially the result of investors piling into Treasuries in hopes of mitigating the potential damage from an equity rout that took the S&P 500 to within spitting distance of a bear market earlier this week. Those same investors are then often reluctant to sell, he said.
Another factor has likely been liquidity providers turning off computer programs that are typically used to trade.
“It just seemed like a lot of the algos got turned off and it’s been sort of happening on and off for two weeks,” he said.
Widespread work-from-home arrangements in the face of the coronavirus outbreak could exacerbate the lack of liquidity in markets, J.P. Morgan said in a separate note to clients."

""Our financial situation is serious and there's an urgent priority to improve the performance of the business and our cash position,"" Adams said in the memo.
