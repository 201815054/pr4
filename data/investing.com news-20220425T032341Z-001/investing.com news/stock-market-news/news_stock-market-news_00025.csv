MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Four years after mining giant Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO) swept out its veteran managers to make way for a new generation of business heads, its leadership team has come unstuck.
The world's biggest iron ore miner is looking for a new chief and iron ore boss after they allowed the blasting of ancient Aboriginal rock shelters to expand a mine in Western Australia against the wishes of the traditional owners.
Investors and analysts saw no clear internal candidates and said following the damage done to the company's reputation, it was likely Rio would tap an outsider to replace Frenchman Jean-Sébastien Jacques.
""Clearly from the comments of the chairman they want to reset the culture, which would imply an external candidate would be more likely than an internal one,"" said Macquarie analyst Hayden Bairstow.
Chairman Simon Thompson said on Friday the company was determined to ""re-establish our reputation as a leader in communities and heritage management"".
Potential external candidates that analysts and investors pointed to included Anglo American (AX:AAL) CEO Mark Cutifani, Orica (AX:ORI) CEO Alberto Calderon, former  Fortescue Metals  Group (AX:FMG) boss Nev Power, and ex-Shell Australia chair Zoe Yujnovich, who previously ran Rio's Canadian iron ore business.
""Zoe has the relevant mining background, international management experience, government relationships, acute sensitivity to indigenous and remote community engagement, and strong Australian roots,"" said one analyst, who declined to be named as he does not cover Rio. 
If the company wants to overhaul its culture, it might be tough to turn to former Rio executives, although several were seen as potential candidates: Newcrest Mining (AX:NCM) Chief Executive Sandeep Biswas, Aurizon  CEO Andrew Harding, OZ Minerals (AX:OZL) CEO Andrew Cole and Fortescue Chief Operating Officer Greg Lilleyman.
However analysts said the company may want to look beyond mining expertise to set a new vision for the company.
""You don't need to be able to do a mine plan for an iron ore pit to run Rio Tinto. Look at (former travel industry executive) Elizabeth Gaines' success at Fortescue,"" Bairstow said.

Investing.com - European stock markets are seen opening mixed Friday, with investors having to work through competing influences of a relatively optimistic ECB and fresh weakness on Wall Street.
At 2:05 AM ET (0605 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.5% higher, while CAC 40 futures in France dropped 0.2% and the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. fell 0.3%.
The European Central Bank left policy unchanged Thursday, as widely expected, but also marginally lifted its growth outlook for the year, buoyed by improving consumer demand.
“In the press conference, the tone was surprisingly optimistic,” said Nordea analyst Jan van Gerich in a research note. “[ECB President Christine] Lagarde emphasized the success of the pandemic emergency purchase program, and the targeted longer-term refinancing operations, the GDP forecast for this year was revised up without corresponding downward revisions to growth longer out, and the core inflation forecast for 2022 was actually revised higher.”
Possibly to counter the impression that the bank had been unduly optimistic, the ECB's chief economist Philip Lane wrote in a blog post on Friday that: ""There is no room for complacency.""
Nordea still expects the ECB to add further stimulus at the December meeting. “The economic recovery is far from guaranteed, inflation and inflation expectations will rise slowly and the ECB may need to do more to secure easy financial conditions.”
At the same time, relations between the European Union and Britain are souring, with the United Kingdom planning on drafting a law to break the divorce treaty between the two bodies, a move that would probably sink four years of Brexit talks. Data Friday showed Britain's economy expanded by 6.6% in July from June, roughly as expected, for its third month of growth as the country recovers from its coronavirus lockdown crash.
The tone on Wall Street overnight was more subdued, as the U.S. big tech firm shares fell again on growing doubts about stretched valuations, the economic recovery and further fiscal stimulus.
Data showed there were 884,000 initial jobless claims in the U.S. last week, more than expected and casting fresh doubt on the U.S. economic recovery from the Covid-19 virus. Additionally, the U.S. Senate voted down a bill for $300 billion in stimulus measures.
In corporate news, Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO) is likely to be in the spotlight after announcing that chief executive Jean-Sébastien Jacques, who has led the mining giant since 2016, will step down. This follows mounting shareholder criticism of the destruction of two significant Aboriginal rockshelters.
Oil prices weakened Friday, hit by a surprise rise in U.S. crude inventories which raises concerns about faltering demand from the commodity’s biggest consumer.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration reported late Thursday a build of 2 millions in crude inventories for last week against expectations of a 1.335 million-barrel draw.  EIA's figures follow the American Petroleum Institute's report earlier in the week of a 2.970 million-barrel build.
U.S. crude futures traded 0.3% lower at $37.19 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract fell 0.4% to $39.89. Both major benchmarks are down around 6.5% for the week and headed for a second week of declines.
Elsewhere, gold futures fell 0.7% to $1,950.80/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.2% higher at 1.1837."

It has, however, applied for the support for budget carrier HK Express, Air Hong Kong, Cargo Terminal, Hong Kong Airport Service and Cathay Pacific Catering Services, the airline said in a statement. That financial support protects jobs from September to November, according to the government website.
Cathay, which received a $5 billion rescue package led by the Hong Kong government, has so far refrained from large-scale job cuts but has warned it is reviewing all aspects of its business model with the results expected in the fourth quarter.
Cathay and its units had around 27,000 employees globally at the end of 2019, according to its annual report. So far the group has cut jobs of around 400 overseas cabin crew and offered voluntary early retirement to pilots.
""It is inevitable we will need to right-size our airlines to address the reduced travel market,"" Cathay General Manager Corporate Affairs Andy Wong said in the statement.
""We continue to make decisions based on the long-term interests of the company and the Hong Kong aviation hub, to protect our future and as many people as possible.""
Several employees have told Reuters on condition of anonymity that they are bracing for major job losses in line with those seen at other airlines in the region. 
Rival Singapore Airlines Ltd (SI:SIAL) announced on Thursday plans to cut around 20% of positions, while Australia's Qantas Airways Ltd (AX:QAN) has said it will cut nearly 30% of its pre-pandemic staff.
Cathay, like Singapore Airlines, lacks a domestic market at a time when most international borders remain closed.

The Hong Kong airline said last month it expected passenger capacity to operate at around 8% of normal in August and September, though demand is strong in its cargo business.

Investing.com – Yokohama-based Nissan (OTC:NSANY) Motor Co., Ltd. (T:7201) has raised $8 billion via its first non-convertible dollar bond sale in at least two decades.
Nissan’s Tokyo shares were down 0.60% to JPY413.5 ($3.90) by 12:27 AM ET (5:27 AM GMT).
The deal, one of the biggest ever in Asia, saw Nissan split the sale into four parts, with a public euro note reportedly due to debut later in the day. It has already priced JPY70 billion ($659.49 million) worth of notes in its home market in July, as well as securing financial backing from the Development Bank of Japan.
Although it has sufficient liquidity, the fundraising followed Nissan’s decision to further strengthen its finances as the company is undertaking business structural reforms, company spokeswoman Azusa Momose told Bloomberg. Access to a broad base of investors is also important, she said.
The Japanese company’s offering adds to record dollar bond sales from Asian issuers this year. As companies look to load up on cash, a broader recovery in global credit markets has also been boosted by March’s monetary stimulus.
With COVID-19 impacting demand, Nissan has been forced to cut jobs and capacity alongside attempts to revive its aging lineup and improve margins. The company forecasts a JPY470 billion ($4.43 billion) operating loss for the current fiscal year after recording its biggest loss in around 20 years.
The company has seen its reputation take a hit since former chairman Carlos Ghosn’s arrest in 2018, which also saw S&P Global Ratings cut Nissan’s credit score to just one level above junk in July."

SEOUL (Reuters) - As Samsung Electronics' (KS:005930) leader Jay Y. Lee readies for a new trial next month, the tech giant has quietly ramped up a public relations campaign touting Lee's deal-making expertise including in winning a $6.6 billion contract from Verizon (N:VZ).
Lauding the Samsung heir as 'the best salesman', the firm has over the past year released a flurry of statements and photos of his visits to its many business sites, showcasing a side of the normally-reserved Lee whose public image has taken a battering over a lengthy bribery scandal.
The mounting legal travails for Lee, which have cast a cloud over the leadership of one of the world's biggest tech companies, coincide with the reformist drive of President Moon Jae-in, elected three years ago after the impeachment and jailing of his predecessor Park Geun-hye.
Lee was indicted last week on suspicions of accounting fraud and stock price manipulation. A trial is scheduled to start on Oct. 22.
The stakes are high, and Samsung's public relations machine has stepped up a charm offensive, telling local media in a message this week that it expected cutting-edge network equipment business to grow into ""the first flagship business of the Lee Jae-yong era,"" using the Vice Chairman of Samsung Electronics' Korean name. 
According to the message seen by Reuters, Samsung said Lee actively engaged Verizon CEO Hans Vestberg on his visit to South Korea last year, and made several video calls with him ahead of clinching a $6.64 billion contract. 
Samsung on Monday announced the contract to provide network equipment to Verizon in the United States, considered a major win as the firm seeks to narrow the gap in the 5G network market with frontrunner Huawei [HWT.UL], which is grappling with U.S. restrictions.
In a statement to Reuters, Samsung said: ""Vice Chairman Jay Y. Lee has played a key role in developing new growth businesses and relationship with global clients and partners.""
""The company responded to media requests and inquiries about his role and client relations,"" it added, saying that this ""was part of normal communications with journalists."" 
In the message, Samsung also highlighted Lee's role in its 5G deal with Japan's KDDI (T:9433) last year despite the worsening bilateral relations. 
""Samsung keeps exposing Lee to the media, to give the message that Lee plays a big role, so if he goes to jail or faces lengthy trials, this would disrupt management, put Samsung in difficulty, and Korean economy in difficulty,"" said Professor Park Sang-in of Seoul National University, a governance expert.
REPUTATIONAL DAMAGE
The fresh charges against Lee has further scarred the 52-year old Samsung scion's reputation and come at a time the world's biggest memory chip maker and No.2 smartphone manufacturer navigates intensifying competition and the coronavirus pandemic. 
Lee is also facing a separate trial on charges of bribing former president Park in an influence-peddling scandal to take control of the business empire from his father, group patriarch Lee Kun-hee, who has been incapacitated since suffering a heart attack in 2014. 
President Moon has pledged to curb the power of South Korea's chaebol, or family-owned conglomerates. 
In the past, convicted business tycoons were shown leniency by courts for their economic contributions, but in a departure, Lee was jailed for nearly a year over the scandal involving Park. 
Lee's father was convicted previously of breach of trust and tax evasion charges, but later received a presidential pardon.
In June, while refuting media reports on Lee's alleged wrongdoings, Samsung said such reports are ""never desirable not only for Samsung’s future but the future of the Korean economy."" 
Samsung Electronics, the crown jewel in the Samsung group, reported annual revenue in 2019 equivalent to 12% of South Korea's economic output. A jump in chip exports helped slow the pace of decline in South Korean exports in the first 10 days of September, trade data showed on Friday. [L4N2G8052] 
""Samsung's PR efforts seem to be to build Lee's good image,"" said Park Ju-gun, head of research firm CEO Score. 

""If Lee cannot serve his role then it could adversely affect the economy, seems to be the nuance.""

The Beijing-based company is looking to spend several billion dollars and add hundreds of jobs over the next three years in the city-state, where it has applied for a license to operate a digital bank, said the people, who asked not to be identified because of confidentiality. The investment would come at a crucial time as the technology firm is forced to sell TikTok operations in the U.S. under pressure by the Trump administration.
ByteDance, the world’s most richly valued startup, is plowing ahead with plans to take its social media services deeper into Asia after setbacks in India and the U.K. as well as the U.S. The internet phenomenon controlled by billionaire Zhang Yiming has long eyed Southeast Asia’s 650 million increasingly smartphone-savvy population, a region where  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd. and Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) Ltd. are also making inroads.
Read how TikTok becomes part of U.S.-China flashpoints
The plans for Singapore include establishment of a data center, the people said. Its operations there include TikTok and Lark, an enterprise software business.
ByteDance currently has more than 200 job openings in Singapore, for positions in everything from payments to e-commerce and data privacy, according to its job referral site. The company already has 400 employees working on technology, sales and marketing in the city-state, one of the people said.
A ByteDance representative offered no comment.
U.S. Deadline
In China, ByteDance also runs news aggregation app Toutiao, and TikTok’s Chinese twin Douyin. Collectively its stable of products have more than 1.5 billion monthly active users. ByteDance is said to have generated more than $3 billion of net profit on more than $17 billion of revenue in 2019.
Asia is a growth area for the company, especially when it is increasingly likely to miss the U.S. government’s deadline for the sale of its TikTok U.S. operations. President Donald Trump said Thursday he won’t extend his Sept. 15 deadline for the deal.
In India, TikTok is among more than a hundred Chinese-made consumer apps that are banned by the government on concerns about security. SoftBank Group Corp. is exploring gathering a group of bidders for TikTok’s India assets.
The U.K. government will likely ban TikTok from moving local user data out of the country, Bloomberg News has reported.
ByteDance is leading a consortium that has applied for a digital-bank license from the Monetary Authority of Singapore. Other members of that group includes a private investment firm owned by a member of the Lee family that founded Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp.
The regulator will award as many as five such permits to non-banks by December. Ant Group and Tencent-backed Sea Ltd. have also applied.

The Japanese carmaker sold the dollar securities in four parts, and may debut a public euro note offering as soon as Friday, according to people familiar with the matter. The fundraising comes after Nissan recorded its biggest loss in about 20 years, and underscores broader strength in global credit markets after a rally sparked by monetary stimulus from March.
It adds to record bond sales in the U.S. currency from Asian issuers this year as companies load up on cash amid the Covid-19 pandemic. Nissan, which allied with Renault SA (OTC:RNLSY) in 1999 and later also with Mitsubishi Motors (OTC:MMTOF) Corp., is cutting jobs and capacity as the crisis hits demand, while seeking to revive an aging lineup and improve margins at the same time. For the current fiscal year through March, Nissan is forecasting a 470 billion yen operating loss.
The Yokohama-based company has already received financial backing from the state-controlled Development Bank of Japan Inc. and in July priced 70 billion yen ($660 million) of notes in its home market.
The automaker has been mired in turmoil since the 2018 arrest of former Chairman Carlos Ghosn. The company’s ratings have also suffered and S&P Global Ratings cut Nissan’s credit score to just one level above junk in July.
Nissan already has sufficient liquidity but has decided to further strengthen its finances as the company is undertaking business structural reforms, according to Azusa Momose, a spokeswoman at the carmaker. Having access to a broad base of investors is also important, she said.

Investing.com – Asian stocks were mixed on Friday morning, reacting to a fresh U.S. tech stocks rout during the previous session.
The selloff, the third in less than two weeks, contributed to continued volatility in stocks globally, signaling a potential end to a rally that has seen U.S. equity values alone add $7 trillion.
“It does not feel good, but corrections are healthy,”  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) asset management head of active equity Ann Miletti told Bloomberg.
“After the increase that we’ve seen in some of the names within tech, it’s not surprising that we’ve got the correction that we’ve seen, and it’s very likely that the volatility is going to continue,” she added.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 rose 0.26% by 11:28 PM ET (4:28 AM GMT) and South Korea’sKOSPI was down 0.87%. Korea saw a slight uptick in the number of daily COVID-19 cases, which stood at 176 cases as of midnight on Thursday.
In Australia, the ASX 200 was down 0.90%.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index edged up 0.17%. The government’s further relaxation of social distancing measures, announced earlier in the week, come into effect today. The city’s public services are also expected to fully return from Tuesday.
China’s Shanghai Composite was down 0.21% while the Shenzhen Component inched up 0.06%. Tensions between China and the U.S. continue to simmer after U.S. President Donald Trump refused to extend the September 15 deadline for ByteDance Ltd to sell TikTok’s U.S. operations.
China and India 's recent tensions settled somewhat earlier in the day, with the two countries inking their first formal agreement since June after border clashes took place earlier in the week.
Gains were further capped by Thursday’s data showing 884,000 initial jobless claims in the U.S., casting fresh doubt on the U.S. economic recovery from COVID-19. The number of claims was more than the predicted 846,000 but remained unchanged from the previous week’s number.
The U.S. Senate also added to Thursday's gloom, voting down a bill submitted by Republicans for $300 billion in stimulus measures as Democrats sought to increase the funding levels.
“It’s a sort of a dead-end street,” Republican Senator Pat Roberts said following the vote, adding that “along with COVID-19, we have a pandemic of politics” in Congress.
Data from Johns Hopkins University showed that the number of global COVID-19 cases had surpassed 28 million as of September 11."

NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Citigroup  Inc's (N:C) appointment of Jane Fraser as its next chief executive on Thursday was celebrated on Wall Street as the first woman to lead one of the top U.S. banks. Yet this is a glass ceiling that corporate America shattered decades ago.
It was 1972 when the Washington Post, then a Fortune 500 company, named Katherine Graham (NYSE:GHM) as its CEO. While progress for female leaders has been slow, 36 of the Fortune 500 companies are now run by women, including automaker General Motors Co (N:GM), chocolate maker  Hershey Co  (N:HSY) and  Northrop Grumman  Corp (N:NOC), according to corporate governance services firm BoardEx.
But the male-dominated financial services industry has fared poorly. Even beyond the major banks, only four of the 200 largest public U.S. financial services companies - Synchrony Financial (N:SYF), Franklin Resources Inc (N:BEN), Nasdaq Inc (O:NDAQ) and CIT Group Inc (N:CIT) - have female CEOs, according to BoardEx.
Women are also underrepresented in CEO roles at financial firms when smaller companies are included. Of the 551 financial companies in the Russell 3000 index, 19, or 3.4%, are led by a woman, compared to 5.4% when counting all Russell 3000 companies, according to The Conference Board, a non-profit representing corporations, and Esgauge, a data-mining firm.
The only sector with a lower representation of women as CEOs is real estate, where there are five female chief executives out of 196 companies, according to The Conference Board and Esgauge.
""These are really positions that women have not pursued because of the work-life balance. We have seen years and years of struggle for women who have to choose,"" said Charlotte Laurent-Ottomane, executive director of the Thirty Percent Coalition, which encourages diversity in corporate boardrooms. 
CEO candidates typically come from roles in finance, operations or running a business line, where there are few women leaders, according to a study from accounting and consulting firm Deloitte. 
Women have higher representation in roles that historically have not been heavily recruited for the top job, such as in legal or human resources departments, according to the study. 
Fraser, 53, has been a rising star in the financial industry, with a career that spans investment banking, wealth management, troubled mortgage workouts and strategy in Latin America – a key business for Citigroup. She was being groomed for the top job after she was elevated to Citigroup president last year.

Among the Citigroup board directors who tapped Fraser as CEO, eight of 17 are women, compared to about a quarter at most other U.S. banks.

(Reuters) -  Boeing Co  (N:BA) said late on Thursday it was in discussions with U.S. safety regulators about a manufacturing issue found last year in its 787 Dreamliner.
KOMO News Radio in Seattle reported the issue involved the vertical tail fin on the 787, citing federal records, and could affect 680 airplanes.
It was the fourth reported production issue disclosed in recent days involving the 787.
Asked about the latest issue, the Federal Aviation Administration reiterated on Thursday it ""is investigating manufacturing flaws affecting certain Boeing 787 jetliners"" but had made no decisions whether to issue new airworthiness directives.
KOMO said the issue involved excessive gaps that could pose a safety concern and cause strain on the structure of the plane over time.
Boeing said in a statement the newly reported ""issue was found in late 2019"" and had been addressed in production. It added its engineers determined ""it did not immediately affect the safety of flight and no immediate action is required.""
The largest U.S. airplane manufacturer added it was ""working with the FAA to finalize guidance for the in-service fleet. Our expectation is that this will require a one-time inspection during regularly scheduled maintenance.""
Boeing said on Tuesday it learned during fabrication of the 787 horizontal stabilizer that some components were clamped with greater force than specified, which could result in improper gap verification and shimming.
A person briefed on the matter said the horizontal stabilizer issue could require inspecting as many as about 900 airplanes.
On Monday, the FAA said it was also investigating two other manufacturing flaws in some 787s.
Boeing said in August that airlines had removed eight 787s from service as a result of two distinct manufacturing issues in fuselage sections.
Boeing said on Monday that some airplanes had shims that were not the proper size, and some airplanes had areas that did not meet skin-flatness specifications. Shims are used to close tiny gaps in joints. Boeing identified the shimming issue in August 2019.

""Individually these issues, while not up to specifications, still meet limit load conditions. When combined in the same location however, they result in a condition that does not meet limit load requirements,"" Boeing said.

The chancellor must also devise a plan to help companies that plunged into debt as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, or risk prolonging the deepest recession in living memory, the House of Commons Treasury Committee said in a report.
“The key will be assisting those businesses who, with additional support, can come through the crisis as sustainable enterprises,” said Chairman Mel Stride, a former Treasury minister. “This requires a very difficult set of judgments.”
The cross-party panel twinned its call for further help with demands for a roadmap to return the public finances to a sustainable position, underlining the fiscal tightrope Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s government is walking.
The chancellor has strongly indicated that tax increases will be needed to stabilize the national debt, which is now above 2 trillion pounds ($2.6 trillion) for the first time and bigger than the size of the economy. However, the Treasury Committee warned that doing so too early could “stifle” the recovery.
The furlough program, under which the government has paid as much as 80% of the wages of some 9.6 million workers, is due to be wound down altogether at the end of next month. The fear is that firms unable to resume payroll costs will be forced to shed workers, driving up unemployment.
‘Trapped’
Sunak insists the program will end as planned. His No. 2, Chief Secretary to the Treasury Steve Barclay, doubled down on that message on Wednesday, saying continuing the program would only serve to keep people “trapped in a job that only exists because of the furlough scheme.”
So far, the initiative has the cost over 35 billion pounds. The Treasury Committee said any extension beyond October should be targeted at those who need it the most.
“A large proportion of businesses in sectors such as hospitality and leisure that are suffering most from social distancing may still have a viable long-term future at the end of October,” the panel said.

LONDON (Reuters) - European Union companies must turn to capital markets in greater numbers to repair their new coronavirus-ravaged balance sheets as banks alone can't plug the funding gap, the New Financial think tank said in a report on Friday.
The bloc has for years been trying to boost the use of capital markets and reduce the preference of smaller, family-run firms in particular for bank loans, a project made all the more urgent by Brexit and the coronavirus pandemic.
The relative underdevelopment of capital markets in the European Union compared with Britain or the United States will limit the role they can play in response to the pandemic, but they can still act as a ""spare tyre"" to complement bank lending, the report said.
An additional 4,000 companies in the EU could realistically raise 470 billion euros in extra funding a year by tapping markets, it said.
""While the Covid crisis has demonstrated the value of bank lending to the economy, banks will be unable to provide the necessary funding for European companies on their own,"" the report said.
The Netherlands, Sweden, Denmark and France with well-developed capital markets that can lead the way, but Germany, Spain and Italy are significantly underdeveloped, it added.
Banks have provided more than 300 billion euros of new lending to EU companies and provided loan payment holidays on more than 350 billion euros during the pandemic, the report said.
Around 800 companies have raised over 370 billion euros on capital markets, or a fifth of all external funding, during the same period.
The region's biggest capital market, Britain, has left the bloc and will be largely locked out of the single market from January, making it harder for EU companies to access the deeper pool of liquidity in London.

The Bank of England also wants to persuade companies to raise more funds on markets, but smaller family firms are loathe to give up control to outside shareholders.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Elliott Management is giving up its board seat at eBay Inc (O:EBAY), the company said on Thursday, less than two years after laying out a blueprint for improvements at the ecommerce company that included divestitures and led to a doubling of the stock price.
Elliott partner Jesse Cohn, who runs the hedge fund's U.S. activism practice, resigned his seat 18 months after joining the group on March 1, 2019 as part of a settlement that gave Elliott and another activist hedge fund a bigger say in the company's operations.
LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) executive Mohak Shroff and Carol Hayles, a former chief financial officer at CIT Group (NYSE:CIT), are joining the board, eBay said in a statement. Ebay founder Pierre Omidyar will step back from board responsibilities and become a director emeritus.
Early in 2019, Elliott, which now owns 1.4% of eBay's stock and ranks as one of its biggest investors, had publicly asked the company to review its portfolio, revitalize its core marketplace business, make operational improvements, return more capital to shareholders and overhaul its leadership.
Since then, eBay has sold its classifieds unit and its StubHub ticket-reselling platform, introduced its first ever dividend, expanded margins and installed a new chief executive. Shares closed at $52.32 on Thursday, after closing at a high of $59.27 on July 10. Before Elliott's position became known in January 2019, the stock traded at $28.97.
""Jesse brought strong leadership skills and a technology investor's perspective to the board. His input was extremely helpful with eBay's operating and portfolio reviews,"" board Chairman Paul Pressler said.
""EBay is a tremendous company and has been a terrific investment for Elliott Management. It was a pleasure to serve on eBay’s Board for the past year and a half,"" Cohn said in a statement.

The move is a setback for LATAM, which needs short-term liquidity. But in a lengthy court decision, the judge left the door open for the Chilean carrier to introduce a similar financing plan in the future, this time without the possibility of converting part of the loan into equity. 
The airline had no immediate comment on the decision. 
The proposal supported by LATAM was composed of a $1.3 billion loan from asset management firm Oaktree Capital Management and a $900 million convertible loan from several key LATAM shareholders, including the Cueto family that controls the airline and Qatar Airways. 
LATAM presented the bankruptcy financing proposal in July, which prompted a challenge from other creditors, who even assembled a separate funding plan with investment bank Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) Group. The key dispute was over the propriety of the convertible loan. 

LATAM filed for bankruptcy protection in May, hammered by the world travel crisis generated by the coronavirus pandemic. At the time, it was the world's largest airline to file for bankruptcy due to COVID-19.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Bayer's (DE:BAYGn) Chief Executive Werner Baumann won an extension of his contract until 2024, in a show of support from the drugmaker's new chairman just months after agreeing an $11 billion settlement of U.S. lawsuits over its Roundup weedkiller.
In a statement on Thursday, the group also said it would only be a matter of weeks to finalise the fragile settlement of claims that Roundup and other glyphosate-based herbicides cause cancer, which Bayer inherited as part of a $63 billion takeover of  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON).
A judge in July raised concern about an agreement with plaintiffs' lawyers on how to handle claims that may be brought in the future, throwing the overall settlement deal into doubt.
Baumann, just weeks after taking the top job in 2016, unveiled plans to purchase Monsanto. 
He had the full backing of then-Chairman Werner Wenning, who retired in April this year and was succeeded by Norbert Winkeljohann, a former head of six European countries at auditing and consulting firm PwC. 
Baumann, 57, hinted the new term would be his last, saying he could have been given up to four years but instead opted for a shorter contract to ""accommodate my personal plans"".
Winkeljohann said he expects ""the glyphosate litigation will be handled in a way that is satisfactory for the company, makes economic sense and is structured in a way that enables potential future cases to be efficiently resolved.""
Bayer in June settled most of the existing lawsuits and also struck an agreement on future cases, proposing a scientific panel to rule on any future claimants that agree to submit to the out-of court procedure.
But after a rebuke on that partial deal from a judge, Bayer conceded there were ""bumps"" to overcome.

The arrangement on future cases is unprecedented because glyphosate will remain on the market without a cancer warning, for which the company has the backing of the U.S. pesticides regulator.

Investing.com - Peloton reported Thursday better-than-expected guidance and fiscal fourth-quarter earnings as sales more than doubled on soaring demand during the pandemic.
 Peloton Interactive Inc  (NASDAQ:PTON) was up more 7% in after-market trading.
The company guided fiscal first-quarter sales within a range of $720 million to $730 million, which would represent 218% growth year-over-year from the mid-point, markedly above expectations between $500-to-520 million.
For fiscal 2021, the company sees sales of between $3.5 billion and $3.65 billion, which at the mid-point of that range would be up 96% from a year earlier.

Connected fitness subscribers jumped 113% to 1.09 million, and are expected to increase in a range of 2.05 million to 2.1 million in fiscal 2021, suggesting the demand is unlikely a one and done story owing to a boost from the pandemic.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Federal law enforcement authorities have charged 57 people with stealing $175 million from an aid program meant to help small businesses weather pandemic lockdowns, officials said on Thursday, adding that they are eyeing hundreds more suspected cases of fraud.
Officials said they have identified 500 individuals who may have defrauded the $660 billion Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) and that, in many cases, criminal rings had worked together to steal funds from the program. The Justice Department along with other agencies would focus more closely on this organized criminal activity, officials said.
""The involvement of these rings isn't surprising, but it is particularly troubling to us here at the department, we will be focusing on these types of cases, going forward,"" acting assistant Attorney General Brian Rabbitt said during a press conference.
Officials said they believed fraud in the program was ""significant"" but declined to estimate what proportion of the funds, which were passed by Congress as part of a $3 trillion pandemic rescue package, had been stolen.
A congressional panel last week said it had identified tens of thousands of the program's 5.2 million loans that may have been defrauded or misused, amounting to potentially billions of taxpayer funds.
This week, JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM), which dished out nearly $30 billion PPP loans, said it was working with law enforcement after identifying cases of customers ""misusing"" the funds. 
Senator Marco Rubio, chair of the Senate's small business committee, on Thursday wrote to JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon asking for more details on the potential fraud and what the bank was doing to mitigate it.

Portland's stock hit its lowest level in nearly six years as investors worried about potential liabilities and drew parallels with rival PG&E Corp (N:PCG) that filed for bankruptcy protection last year anticipating more than $30 billion in liabilities from deadly wildfires in California.
In the past three weeks, the U.S. West Coast has been reeling from dozens of extreme wind-driven wildfires, which have destroyed hundreds of homes and killed at least seven people.
Portland General said on Thursday it was not aware of any evidence that its equipment caused any of the fires.
The company added that it has proactively cut power to eight different high-risk fire areas in addition to the public safety power shutoff in the Mt. Hood corridor in Oregon.
The electric utility said in a statement dated Sept. 8 that it was receiving unconfirmed reports that some fires in Oregon may have been started by electrical equipment affected by heavy winds and debris. The company's shares fell after CNBC reported the news on Thursday.
Three people died from a lightning-sparked fire in northern California in the past 48 hours, while three were reported dead in Oregon and a 1-year-old boy died in Washington state, police reported. 
There are currently about 60,000 homes and businesses in Oregon without power, according to local utilities. Another 60,000 outages in Utah and about 30,000 in California are currently in place, most of them related to fires.
Utility firms in the United States have been embroiled in controversy over their equipment causing wildfires.
PG&E, which emerged from bankruptcy in July, has pleaded guilty to 84 counts of involuntary manslaughter stemming from a devastating 2018 wildfire in n California touched off by its power lines. 

Earlier this week, PG&E Corp shut power to around 150,000 customers in California due to fires. PG&E said this morning that it had restored service to most of those customers.

(Reuters) -  Citigroup  Inc (N:C) named consumer banking head Jane Fraser as its next chief executive on Thursday, making her the first woman to lead a major Wall Street bank.
Fraser, 53, has been a rising star in the financial industry, with a career that spans investment banking, wealth management, troubled mortgage workouts and strategy in Latin America – a key geography for Citigroup. She will take the reins from CEO Michael Corbat in February, the bank said.
Fraser's promotion to CEO was celebrated as a step in the right direction for an industry that has few women or diverse executives in its top ranks.
""Great news for the company and for women everywhere!"" tweeted Bank of America Corp (N:BAC) operations and technology chief Cathy Bessant. ""A big and fantastic moment.""
In an internal memo, Corbat characterized Fraser's new role as a groundbreaking event and a point of pride for Citigroup.
Fraser has spoken publicly about the struggles she faced as a young woman, and then a working mother, in a competitive industry.
At 2016 event hosted by an international business group, she described her early days as an investment banker, when women were expected to act and dress like men to succeed, as well as her experience juggling home life and work.
""I'm often asked, 'Can you have it all? Can you do it all?'"" she said at a 2016 event hosted by an international business society. ""And I say, 'Yes, you can, but you can't do it all at once and don't expect everything at once.""
Fraser joins a small group of women who have broken through the glass ceiling to reach the C-suite at major financial firms.
In addition to Bessant, there is Fidelity Investments CEO Abigail Johnson; JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM)'s consumer lending head Marianne Lake and its finance chief Jennifer Piepszak; and Alison Rose, CEO of British bank NatWest. 
Only 37 of companies on this year's Fortune 500 list are led by women. 
Fraser launched her career in  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc's (N:GS) mergers & acquisitions department in London, then worked for Asesores Bursátiles in Madrid. She joined Citigroup 16 years ago and is credited internally with helping the bank recover after the financial crisis, when it had to take $45 billion in taxpayer funds to survive. Through the years, she has run client strategy in Citi's investment bank, as well as its private bank, its mortgage business and its operations in Latin America, which accounted for 14% of annual revenue in 2019.
Her name was floated as a potential CEO candidate at  Wells Fargo  & Co (N:WFC) last year, before the board settled on former JPMorgan executive Charles Scharf. In October, Fraser was promoted to the role of president and tasked to head its global consumer bank, a move that was widely seen as a precursor to her elevation.
Dylan Haggart, a partner at ValueAct Capital, which owns 27 million shares of Citigroup, said that the hedge fund had worked closely with Fraser in recent years and developed a ""deep appreciation for her ability to lead thoughtful strategic transformation and drive operational results.""
 Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) analyst Susan Roth Katzke said the promotion came sooner than expected, and that investors are eager to get an audience with her. ""Investors will need to hear more from Jane, sooner rather than later,"" she said.
CORBAT'S LEGACY
Corbat, who has spent 37 years at Citigroup, was launched into the CEO role in 2012, when his predecessor suddenly left under pressure from investors. Since then, he has shifted Citigroup's strategy to focus on corporate businesses where it has strengths, like fixed-income trading and cash management, as well as credit cards and digital consumer banking.
He also wound down a huge book of troubled assets known as Citi Holdings, effectively transforming the bank from a bailed out, money-losing entity with operations spanning the world into a slimmer, more profitable version with targeted global operations.
Citigroup's annual profits have more than doubled under Corbat, but rival banks have done better. Only recently has Citigroup been able to meet performance targets that Corbat set and tweaked through the years.

Its shares have risen 43% during his tenure, vs 63% to 188% for Wall Street peers.

Rubio, who had also urged a probe of TikTok's ownership by another Chinese firm, made the request in a letter to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. The department leads the inter-agency Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States.
GNC, a health and nutrition products retailer, has said it has agreed in principle with many lenders to sell itself to an affiliate of its largest shareholder, Harbin Pharmaceutical (SS:600664), for $760 million in a court-supervised auction, subject to higher bids.
Harbin's controlling stake was reviewed by CFIUS and approved in 2018, a GNC spokesperson said, adding that no consumer data was available to any foreign national.
""That (2018) transaction was approved, and no facts or circumstances have changed to call the committee’s support into question. We will continue to work with all relevant agencies throughout the restructuring process and maintain our rigorous standards for data privacy,"" the spokesperson said.

""Efforts to obtain personal and sensitive data related to health information and financial transactions of U.S. persons must be reviewed with an understanding of the malign foreign policy and intelligence aims of the Chinese government and Communist Party,"" he wrote.

Rubin also noted that GNC has many shops in and near U.S. military facilities. ""In the event of a GNC acquisition by HPGC, Chinese authorities and intelligence officials could leverage GNC military sites to gain access to those restricted locations,"" he wrote.

(Reuters) - American Airline's (O:AAL) wholly-owned carrier Envoy is closing its bases at La Guardia and John F. Kennedy airports in New York, the regional airline told employees in a memo on Thursday, as the industry grapples with a plunge in passengers due to the pandemic.
An Envoy spokeswoman confirmed the plan that will affect flight crew and maintenance teams at the New York bases, which have been closed since March due to COVID-19.
Envoy, one of three regional carriers owned by American, did not say whether any jobs were at risk because of the closure.
""It is important not to draw any conclusions about other American Eagle (NYSE:AEO) carriers and their operations due to this announcement,"" Envoy's Dee Temples said in the memo, which was seen by Reuters.
American did not immediately comment.
Legacy carriers like American, which for years relied on regional carriers to feed traffic from smaller cities to international destinations, had already shown signs of wanting to move away from small 50-seat jets like those flown by Envoy, but the crisis has accelerated some of those plans.
The announcement follows news in July that American was teaming up with JetBlue Airways (O:JBLU) to boost flying options in New York and Boston.
Under that agreement, American is expected to shift some JFK and LaGuardia airport slots to JetBlue and in return JetBlue will help feed traffic to American's international destinations next year.

The regional carrier said in July it had issued just over 2,000 warnings of potential furloughs as the airline industry adjusts to a sharp downturn and the end of federal aid that so far has kept aviation workers on payroll until Sept. 30.

ZURICH/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - AstraZeneca (NYSE:AZN) should still know by year-end whether its experimental vaccine protects people against coronavirus, as long as it is cleared to resume trials soon, its chief executive said on Thursday amid doubts over its rollout.
Governments desperate to put an end to the COVID-19 pandemic which has caused more than 900,000 deaths and huge economic and social disruption during 2020 are pinning their hopes on a vaccine.
However British drugmaker AstraZeneca suspended late-stage trials on its potential vaccine this week after an illness in a participant in Britain who was reported to be suffering from symptoms associated with transverse myelitis, a rare spinal inflammatory disorder.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has flagged the AstraZeneca vaccine, which is being developed with the University of Oxford, as the most promising for coronavirus.
CEO Pascal Soriot said during an online event on Thursday that AstraZeneca (L:AZN) did not yet know the diagnosis of the participant who was ill, adding that it was not clear if the volunteer had transverse myelitis and more tests were needed.
The diagnosis would be submitted to an independent safety committee and this would usually then say whether trials can be resumed, Soriot said, adding it was usual for such pauses. 
""It's very common, actually, and many experts will tell you this,"" Soriot said, adding: ""The difference with other vaccine trials is, the whole world is not watching them, of course. They stop, they study, and they restart.""
Shares in AstraZeneca fell on Wednesday after the trial halt raised doubts about the timeline for the vaccine's rollout.
AstraZeneca would supply vaccines to countries at the same time to ensure a fair and equitable distribution, Soriot said, reiterating that the company was close to having capacity to produce 3 billion doses at sites set up around the world to prevent governments from restricting distribution.
With up to 60,000 people set to participate in the study program, AstraZeneca's CEO said the volume was typical of vaccine trials and large enough to spot rare side effects.
""With this you are going to pick up very rare events."" he said, adding that a planned staggered launch, prioritizing at-risk groups, would provide further assurance for the masses that are set to be covered by government plans at a later stage.
Serum Institute of India, one of AstraZeneca's (L:AZN) development and production partners, said on Thursday it was joining the suspension, backtracking on remarks that it did not face any issues.
'DIFFICULT TO BE SURE'
Transverse myelitis cases after a vaccination have been documented before, but concrete links between the condition and vaccinations have not been established, experts said.
The U.S.-based Mayo Clinic concludes that the association so far is not strong enough to warrant limiting any vaccine.
A 2009 review in the journal Lupus of nearly 40 years of English-language publications found 37 cases of transverse myelitis associated with hepatitis B vaccines, measles-mumps-rubella, diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis and others.
The vaccines remained on the market, Stephen Evans, a professor of pharmacoepidemiology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said.
Linking such an autoimmune response to a single factor like a vaccine is problematic, he said, given the number of immunological, hormonal or environmental factors at play.
""It's terribly difficult to be sure,"" Evans said.
RBC Capital Markets analyst Bryan Abrahams cautioned the trial participant's condition must be thoroughly investigated.
""Even a single case could possibly imply a rate or association higher in the study than what is normally observed sporadically"" he wrote to investors, adding a one in 10,000 risk, if confirmed, would likely be unacceptable.
BioNTech (O:BNTX), among the frontrunners in the vaccine race with partner  Pfizer  (N:PFE), echoed remarks by Soriot that clinical halts are a common feature of immunization trials.

""Safety is a top priority,"" its CEO Ugur Sahin told Reuters.

Investing.com --   Bed Bath & Beyond Inc  (NASDAQ:BBBY) is cheap, and Wedbush says buy, assuming you can wait a few years for the pay off. 
Shares rose 7% after Wedbush added BBBY to the firm's Best Ideas List, and lifted its price target to $18 from $15, StreetInsider reported. The shares are currently trading a little over $12.
""BBBY shares continue to trade at distressed levels despite the company turning the corner to positive comps in recent months and being on the cusp of a dramatic improvement in profitability,"" Wedbush wrote. ""Indeed, the company is poised to generate at least $700m of EBITDA in two-to-three years, yet its pro-forma enterprise value is only 2x that level.""
Bed Bath & Beyond has a path to nearly $850 million in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization in 2022 using conservative estimates, and is not simply a beneficiary of the coronavirus-related demand surge, the analyst wrote, according to StreetInsider.      
Not many analysts agree with Wedbush's argument. The stock has three buys, six holds and four sells, and an average price target of $9.75, according to analysts tracked by Investing.com.

34,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 10, 2020 02:05PM ET</span>",Tesla shares rebound from steep rout,"By Noel Randewich
(Reuters) - Shares of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) jumped 5% on Thursday, winning back gains for a second day after suffering their worst one-session rout ever earlier this week. 
The electric car maker's rise brought its two-day gain to 17%, far outperforming the Nasdaq, which struggled to recover from a recent sell-off fueled by technology stocks.
Tesla on Tuesday tumbled 21% after S&P Dow Jones Indices opted not to add the world's most valuable carmaker to the S&P 500, surprising traders who had bet heavily that it would be added to the index. Following its rebound on Wednesday and Thursday, Tesla remains down about 23% from its record high close on Aug. 31.
Even after its recent drop, Tesla’s stock has surged over 300% this year as the company has reported improved profitability, helped by the sale of regulatory credits that offset losses in its core business of selling cars. Tesla's market capitalization stands at about $360 billion, making it more valuable than all but a handful of U.S. publicly listed companies.
Last week, the six-month average of Tesla's market capitalization surpassed $200 billion, qualifying Chief Executive Elon Musk for a third tranche of options awarded as part of his 2018 pay package. Together, the three tranches are now worth an unprecedented $8 billion, after accounting for the cost of exercising them.
For a graphic on Elon Musk's expanding payout:

The median compensation for Tesla employees last year was about $58,000, according to a company filing. In April, Tesla cut employees' salaries during a shutdown of its U.S. production facilities because of the coronavirus outbreak. 
Tesla investors and analysts are now focused on the company's ""Battery Day"" event on Sept. 22, the same day as its shareholder meeting, with Musk expected to tout improvements in battery performance. 

At an event similarly promoting autonomous driving technology last year, Musk said that Tesla robotaxis with no human drivers would be available in some U.S. markets in 2020, continuing a habit of bold pronouncements that have excited loyal investors while often missing deadlines.

36,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 10, 2020 01:18PM ET</span>",Hedge Funds Bought the Dip as Nasdaq Tumbled Into a Correction,"(Bloomberg) -- Hedge funds stepped up buying of technology shares during the Nasdaq 100’s first correction since March, once again warming up to the industry after trimming stakes.
Professional managers that make both bullish and bearish equity bets scooped up internet and software companies on Friday and Tuesday at the fastest rate in five months, according to data compiled by  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS).’s prime-brokerage unit. Meanwhile, hedge-fund clients at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) increased their exposure to growth and momentum stocks, styles dominated by tech companies, the firm’s data showed.
Having taken a more neutral stance on tech as retail traders piled into the FAANG names and stay-at-home darlings like  Zoom Video Communications  (NASDAQ:ZM) Inc. and Peloton Interactive (NASDAQ:PTON) Inc., hedge funds took advantage of the Nasdaq 100’s three-day, 11% slump that chopped valuations from levels last seen 20 years ago.
“They’re just riding the wave and believe that with interest rates low and inflation non-existent and with the Fed saying, ‘We’ll let it run a little hot,’ there’s more room to run,” said Chris Gaffney, president of world markets at TIAA Bank. “Is it a bubble and do we continue to inflate that bubble? I think that it can continue to inflate.”
Hedge funds’ conviction in tech shares is echoing confidence by retail investors, who stood firm during the rout and continued to build up positions through stocks and options. The Nasdaq 100 rose as much as 1.5% before erasing gains on Thursday.
The big five -- Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL).,  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT)., Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)., Google’s parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc. and  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB). -- saw net buying for two straight sessions through Tuesday, after being sold in eight of the previous nine days, Goldman data showed. At Morgan Stanley, hedge funds turned to net buyers in tech stocks over the same stretch after selling in August.
While the retreat prior to the selloff helped limit the pain for fund managers, their tech positioning remained elevated -- net exposure stood at the 95th percentile since 2010, Morgan Stanley data showed.
The heavy tilt toward tech is one reason that Morgan Stanley is warning clients about the risk in coming months should equity losses deepen and hedge funds’ favorite shares bear the brunt of selling.
Based on the firm’s data, the group’s top 50 popular stocks made up about 38% of the total long exposure, a level that’s hovering near a 10-year high. Gross leverage, a measure of industry risk appetite that takes into account both long and short positions, sat near the top 10th percentile of the historic range, with short leverage way below the average.
“Should the market pull back further, the performance pain will likely be more significant on the long portfolio, but there could be further appetite to add to short exposure,” Morgan Stanley wrote in the note to clients. “However, with gross leverage elevated, there will likely be a limit as to how much funds would add to the short side, unless long leverage were to come off.”

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets turned negative at midday, after opening strongly on Thursday, shrugging another set of weekly jobless claims numbers that suggested the labor market recovery is stalling.
By 12:47 PM ET (1647 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 185 points or 0.66% while the S&P 500 was 0.58%. The Nasdaq Composite, which has seen the greatest volatility over the last week as a skewed options market has rapidly rebalanced, fell 0.32%. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares were down 0.98%.
Earlier, figures released by the Department of Labor showed that initial jobless claims stuck at 884,000 last week, unchanged from the previous week and above consensus forecasts. The total number of people claiming jobless benefits as of the week through August 22 rose by nearly 400,000 to 29.61 million.
However, economists still believe that the economy is recovering more strongly than they initially expected: a monthly Wall Street Journal survey of analysts suggested third-quarter gross domestic product will grow by 23.9% on an annualized basis, up from a consensus of 18.3% a month earlier.
Earlier in the session, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock continued the recovery from its 21% decline on Tuesday, rising another 4.0%. By contrast, shares in Nikola (NASDAQ:NKLA), the aspiring electric truck-maker, fell 8.0% after short-seller Hindenburg Research published a short report on the stock, in which it called the company ""an intricate fraud built on dozens of lies.""
Nikola, which sold an 11% stake in itself to GM for $2 billion earlier in the week, didn't immediately post a response to the allegations on its website.
Shares in conventional truck-maker Navistar (NYSE:NAV) rose 16.6% after Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) truck unit Traton (DE:8TRA) raised its offer for the company to $43 a share.
Elsewhere,  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) stock rose 1.8% - without threatening to break out of a narrow range it has been in since June - after the bank announced that Jane Fraser will succeed CEO Michael Corbat when he retires in February. Fraser, who has been Citi's president and head of its consumer bank for the last year, is the first woman to take control of a major Wall Street institution.
Mall owners Simon Property Group (NYSE:SPG) and Brookfield Property Partners (NASDAQ:BPY) were down 0.6% and up 1.5% respectively after agreeing to buy most of the assets of bankrupt department store JC Penney (OTC:JCPNQ), whose stock rose 27% in over-the-counter trading."

The German automaker made a $35 per share offer in January to try to increase its stake in Navistar beyond the 16.6% it bought in 2016, but failed to secure a majority stake. Analysts at Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) have said Navistar is worth at least $45 a share.
Volkswagen said Traton's new offer valued the shares in Navistar it doesn't already own at around $3.6 billion. 
""We believe it's in Traton's interest to move quickly on NAV (Navistar) as NAFTA truck market recovers,"" Jefferies said in a note on Thursday, referring to North American markets. 
Navistar said it would review the revised offer.
""Navistar's Board of Directors and management team are committed to exploring all avenues to maximize value. Consistent with its fiduciary duties, the Board will carefully review the revised proposal from Traton,"" Navistar said. 
Like the auto industry, the truck sector faces pressure to consolidate to share the costs of developing low emission technologies. Traton and Navistar have been collaborating on purchasing and electric vehicle technology.
But Traton has struggled to win over Navistar's largest shareholder, financier Carl Icahn, whose fund controls 16.9% of Navistar's shares. Icahn and two other activist funds, Mark Rachesky's MHR Fund Management and Gabelli Funds, together own 40% of Navistar's shares, according to Refinitiv data.

Volkswagen said on Thursday it would provide funds to finance Traton's increased offer with the aim of Traton becoming the sole owner of Navistar.

Hindenburg accused Nikola's founder Trevor Milton of nepotism and said it has gathered enough evidence to show that Milton made false statements to form partnerships with large automakers.
The short-seller said Milton appointed his brother, Travis, to lead the Hydrogen Production/Infrastructure unit, despite not having any substantial experience related to the sector.

DUBAI (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia's sovereign fund PIF is weighing a potential investment in the initial public offering of Chinese financial technology firm Ant Group, which could be the world's biggest IPO, two sources familiar with the matter said.
Ant,  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA)'s fintech arm and China's dominant mobile payments firm, filed for a dual listing in Hong Kong and on Shanghai's Nasdaq-style STAR Market last month.
The offering size could reach as much as $30 billion if market conditions allow, Reuters reported citing three sources.
That would make it the world's biggest IPO since oil giant  Saudi Aramco  (SE:2222) raised $29.4 billion last December, which surpassed the record set by China's Alibaba Group Holding Ltd's BABA.N, (HK:9988). 
The Public Investment Fund (PIF) was approached by Ant through its advisors to consider investing in the deal, the sources said.
""They are looking at it,"" said one of the sources. 
If the investment goes ahead, it would be the Saudi fund's most high profile direct investment in a Chinese company.
PIF declined to comment. Ant spokespersons did not immediately respond to Reuters request for comment outside Asia business hours.
Ant's initial public offering would be the first simultaneous listing in Hong Kong and the year-old STAR Market, boosting Hong Kong's status as an international IPO market and helping enhance STAR as a capital markets centre. 
PIF, which has over $300 billion in assets, has been largely pouring funds in the United States, but in June it agreed to invest $1.49 billion in Reliance Industries’ digital unit Jio Platform. 
PIF's head Yasir al-Rumayyan told CNBC last year the fund has its eye on China as it expands international investments. 
Since becoming a more active investor in 2015, PIF has made some bold steps to raise its profile on the global stage. 

It took a $3.5 billion stake in Uber Technologies (N:UBER) and invested $45 billion in Softbank (OTC:SFTBY)'s inaugural technology fund.

PARIS (Reuters) - Luxury goods group LVMH said on Thursday it would counter-sue Tiffany, accusing it of mismanagement through the coronavirus crisis after the U.S. jeweller accused the French group of trying to bow out of a $16 billion acquisition deal.
The owner of brands such as Louis Vuitton, led by billionaire Bernard Arnault, said on Wednesday it could not complete its Tiffany purchase after the French government requested a delay on closing the transaction. 
Tiffany has filed a lawsuit against LVMH in Delaware - the U.S. state in which the New York-based company is registered - to force it to complete the deal as agreed last year, before the COVID-19 pandemic took hold. 
The spread of the virus has dealt a big blow to the luxury sector and raised questions about whether LVMH was overpaying. 
""LVMH was surprised by the lawsuit filed by Tiffany against the group,"" the French group said in a statement, calling it unfounded. ""LVMH will defend itself vigorously.""
LVMH, which said it would also lodge its claim in Delaware, added that the lawsuit would challenge the way Tiffany managed its business during the pandemic, including its payout of dividends. 
Tiffany approved quarterly dividend payouts of $0.58 per share in May and August, as allowed by the merger agreement. LVMH says that given the U.S. company was losing money and its sales were falling because of the health emergency, it should not have done so. LVMH cut its own dividend for the fiscal year 2019 by 30%.
LVMH has said it cannot complete the deal under the agreed terms because of the French government's request to delay it, and that it had no desire to extend the closing deadline beyond the original date of Nov. 24. 
But it has rejected Tiffany's claim that it was stalling the transaction by putting off its antitrust clearance requests and also that it was using the French government as a fig leaf to back out of the deal. 
It said on Thursday it would file its requests for approval to European competition authorities in the coming days, and expected to win approval in October.
SALES DROP 
LVMH said in its statement on Thursday that Tiffany had significantly underperformed LVMH's own comparable brands in the first half of 2020, and said the U.S. group's prospects for 2020 were ""very disappointing.""
Tiffany recorded a net loss of $33 million in the first half of 2020, compared to a 17 million euros loss for LVMH's jewellery and watches division, which includes the Bulgari brand. 
The French group does not disclose the financial performance of individual brands. Like-for-like sales fell 39% at its group's watches and jewellery division in the first half compared with a 34% fall for Tiffany. 
However, the French group as a whole, a diversified conglomerate, limited the sales decline for the period to 28% and booked a 1.67 billion euros profit from recurring operations. 
According to the merger agreement, a material adverse effect (MAE) is triggered if Tiffany’s business underperforms its peers substantially. The MAE is a standard clause in merger agreements that a buyer can invoke to pull out of a deal if an event occurs that harms the target company before the deal is finalised.
Tiffany said in its lawsuit that LVMH had tried repeatedly to find a pretext to invoke such a clause, and did so for the first time when Tiffany postponed the original August 24 closing deadline for the deal by three months.
Sources told Reuters in June that Arnault, a shrewd deal maker known as the ""wolf in cashmere"" who has built an empire through acquisitions, was exploring ways to renegotiate the price of the Tiffany deal - something the company's finance chief denied on Wednesday.

Analysts said the two sides may still agree to close the deal at a lower price, though some did not rule out that Arnault may have already set his sights on a different prey.

The average for a 30-year, fixed loan was 2.86%, down from 2.93% last week and the lowest in almost 50 years of data-keeping by  Freddie Mac  (OTC:FMCC). It was the ninth time since the coronavirus stated roiling financial markets that rates fell to a new low. The previous record, 2.88%, was reached in early August.
Cheap mortgages have ignited a housing rebound, driving sales of both new and existing homes and putting money back into the pockets of borrowers who have been able to refinance.
Still, the rally faces challenges from persistent job losses and an inventory shortage that’s pushing up prices, reducing the pool of people who can afford to buy a house.
“Heading into the fall, it will be difficult to sustain the growth momentum in purchases because the lack of supply is already exhibiting a constraint on sales activity,” Sam Khater, Freddie Mac’s chief economist, said in a statement Thursday.

Tesla shares shed 21% on Tuesday - their biggest one-day percentage drop on record - after the stock’s surprise exclusion from the S&P 500 (SPX).
The selloff early this week wiped out $75 billion dollars off the company's market value, exacerbated by the hedges built around massive betting on Tesla options by retail and institutional traders during the stock’s four-fold rise since March. 
""All the excess buying in call options suddenly hit a critical mass and you had this inflection point last week,"" said Peter Garnry, head of equity strategy at Saxo Bank.
The implied volatility on near-term Tesla options is ranging around 100%, luring a lot of speculators into cashing in through spread structures and potentially implying massive buying and selling of the stock in coming days.
More than 1 million Tesla call options -- contracts that entitle buyers to buy the stock – have traded on average in the past three sessions, which is a more than 30% jump over volumes in recent weeks, a London-based trader said.
Yet, the sudden surge in borrowing of Tesla shares by short sellers with 7% of outstanding shares being shorted suggests a tug of war between bulls and bears is in store.
""I think they (short sellers) are definitely smelling blood,"" Garnry said.
Tesla is not alone. Apple (O:AAPL) and other major technology stocks have also seen their options volumes skyrocket and stock prices fall this week, with investors pointing to the massive options purchases by retail traders and the SoftBank Group Corp (T:9984) as reasons for the August euphoria and the September pullback.
""It was a lesson learnt in risk management (for retail traders)... I think also the U.S. election now will be pulled into the arena as sort of the centre focus in terms of risk,"" Garnry added.
He believes U.S. stocks could trade sideways from here.

Wall Street’s biggest players, however, are viewing the tech-led selloff as a bout of turbulence rather than the start of a longer slide, and they don't see it as a reason to run for the door.

The spill occurred on May 29 after a fuel tank lost pressure and released 21,000 tonnes of diesel into rivers and subsoil near the city of Norilsk in Siberia. Greenpeace has compared the incident to the 1989 Exxon (NYSE:XOM) Valdez oil spill off Alaska.
The watchdog had previously asked Nornickel to pay this sum voluntarily. Nornickel argued with it over the sum but set aside $2 billion in reserves, which caused a slump in its first-half net profit.
Nornickel did not reply to a Reuters request for comment on Thursday.
Some analysts have said that the amount is not critical to the financial stability of the $41-billion mining giant but it could prompt it to increase debt and reduce dividends.
Nornickel shares were down 1.2% in Moscow on Thursday, underperforming the benchmark index (IMOEX), which was broadly stable.

NEW DELHI/DUBAI (Reuters) - India's  Reliance Industries  Ltd (NS:RELI) has approached investors in its digital business about potentially buying stakes in its retail arm, two sources with direct knowledge of the matter said on Thursday.
The oil-to-telecoms conglomerate is looking to attract more investors to Reliance Retail as the business expands rapidly online to take on the likes of Walmart Inc's (N:WMT) Flipkart and Amazon.com Inc's (O:AMZN) Indian arm.
Earlier this year, Reliance, controlled by Asia's richest man Mukesh Ambani, sold nearly 33% of its Jio Platforms digital business, netting more than $20 billion from companies including Facebook (O:FB), Alphabet's (O:GOOGL) Google, KKR & Co (N:KKR) and Silver Lake Partners.
Mumbai-based Reliance has approached some investors from that deal to take stakes in the retail business, although ""it is understood not all will participate"", one of the sources told Reuters, asking not to be named as talks are private. 
The sources did not specifically name which companies Reliance had approached.
Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF) and Abu Dhabi state fund Mubadala Investment Company - both backers of Jio Platforms - are also weighing a potential investment, a third source said.
""It is a strategic relationship that these funds have with Reliance which goes beyond one deal,"" said this source.
PIF and Mubadala declined to comment.
Reliance Retail, which has nearly 12,000 stores and sells everything from groceries to iPhones, acquired rival Future Group's retail arm last month.
This week, it announced a $1 billion investment from U.S. private equity firm Silver Lake Partners.
""We've received strong interest from strategic and financial investors in Reliance Retail,"" Ambani told shareholders at the company's annual meeting in July.
AMAZON TALKS
Bloomberg News cited on Thursday an unidentified person with knowledge of the matter as saying Reliance was offering to sell a roughly 40% stake in its retail arm, worth about $20 billion, to Amazon.
Amazon has held talks about investing in Reliance Retail and expressed an interest in negotiating potential deals, but has made no decision, Bloomberg's report said.
Reuters could not independently verify whether Amazon and Reliance were in fresh discussions.
Last year, Reuters reported that Amazon had been mulling a proposal to purchase an up to a 26% stake in Reliance Retail. Earlier this year, the Economic Times reported that Amazon was in talks to buy a 9.9% stake in Reliance Retail. 
Amazon did not respond to a Reuters request for comment.
Reliance said it did not comment on speculation and rumours, adding it ""evaluates various opportunities on an ongoing basis.""
SHARES SURGE
Shares in Reliance rose as much as 8.5% on Thursday, making it the first listed Indian firm to achieve a market capitalization of more than $200 billion.
Ambani, the world's fifth richest man, is shifting his empire's focus towards retail after successfully building India's largest telecom network by customers in four years, hoping to take a dominant position as India's huge consumer market comes of age.
For Reliance, a deal with Amazon could potentially leverage the e-commerce giant's global experience in technology, supply chain and logistics, as it aims to connect mom-and-pop stores across India digitally through its Jio telecoms network.
For Amazon, a stake in Reliance Retail could give it access to the Jio telecoms platform and its vast retail footprint across India. It could also add more firepower to Amazon's local lobbying efforts, as the Ambani family is well-connected.

The reported discussions come at a time when Amazon has been facing tighter regulatory scrutiny and anti-trust cases in India, with brick-and-mortar retailers alleging it uses unfair business practices to operate its online marketplace in the country, an allegation Amazon denies.

LONDON (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM),  Citigroup  Inc (N:C) and  State Street  Corp (N:STT) have invested $11 million in Capitolis, a New York-based technology startup that seeks to help banks use capital more efficiently, the companies said. 
Capitolis, which was founded by Gil Mandelzis, a former senior executive at ICAP (LON:NXGN) and former  Thomson Reuters  (NYSE:TRI) Chief Executive Tom Glocer, will use the funding to grow its team and operations, the startup said. The company did not disclose its valuation.
Capitolis expects its team to grow to 90 people by the end of the year from 50 at start, Mandelzis said. 
Founded in 2017, Capitolis has developed software to improve liquidity in capital markets by allowing banks to rapidly source capital needed for trades from other financial institutions with large balance sheets. 
Regulations implemented following the 2008 financial crisis have increased the amount of capital banks must post as collateral for risky trades making it more costly for them to participate in some markets.
""Banks are constrained by the costs of capital, but there is a lot of capital in the world looking for returns,"" Mandelzis said. ""We are allowing the banks to tap into infinite sources of financing.""
Capitolis' technology also allows banks to reduce the notional value of their derivatives portfolios by replacing multiple offsetting derivatives contracts with smaller residual trades. This frees up capital but is often done manually with spreadsheets and paperwork. 
To date the company says it has eliminated $5 trillion in overall positions for more than 50 financial institutions including JPMorgan, Citi and State Street.
""We are happy to support them as they invest and build technology that helps free up capital creating greater efficiencies within the global markets industry,"" Troy Rohrbaugh, Head of Global Markets at JPMorgan, said in a statement.

Capitolis' existing investors include Spark Capital, Index Ventures and Sequoia Capital.

LONDON (Reuters) - The tech-led reboot of stock markets stalled in Europe on Thursday as traders pulled back to hear just how twitchy the European Central Bank has become about the euro's run-up in recent months.
The ECB's upcoming meeting, along with emergency Brexit talks in London after negotiations turned chaotic again, and wilting commodity markets kept the bulls firmly on the leash.
An early push from the pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) quickly faltered as tech struggled, the euro and government bonds gained pre-ECB, and drooping oil and metals prices hit the region's drillers and miners. 
Analysts were waiting to see whether reports that the ECB will fractionally revise up its COVID-battered economic and inflation forecasts later would ultimately affect the chances of a further ramping up of stimulus, which would rein in the euro.
The currency has firmed 8% against the dollar since the spring and more than 4% against a basket of currencies weighted by the bloc's foreign trade. It was hovering at $1.1830, not far below the sensitive $1.20 level.
""What happens at the ECB today is quite important for global markets,"" said TD Securities' European head of currency strategy, Ned Rumpeltin. 
""There is still one trade, which is reflate or die,"" he said, referring to stimulus aid lifting asset prices. ""So the degree to which the ECB either takes that one step forward or one step back today will be important."" 
Overnight, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan (MIAPJ0000PUS) had snapped its longest losing streak since February with a 0.7% gain. Japan's Nikkei (N225) rose 0.9% and Chinese blue chips (CSI300) rose 0.8%.
Markets in Sydney (AXJO) and Hong Kong (HSI) were just better than flat though and, in a reminder of the risks, Jakarta (JKSE) nosedived 5% on plans to re-introduce COVID-19 social restrictions in the Indonesian capital.
Like Europe though, Wall Street futures were down between 0.5%-0.6% ahead of the restart there following the wild recent run, in which super-charged tech stocks like Tesla (O:TSLA) and Apple (O:AAPL) were suddenly torpedoed. (N)
Mizuho Bank's head of economics and strategy in Singapore, Vishnu Varathan, said investors were grappling with whether this month's steep U.S. tech sell-off was really done, and beyond that an increasingly uncertain U.S. political outlook and persistent Sino-U.S. tensions.
Concerns about demand for fuel also had oil prices back under pressure, in an indication of wavering confidence in global growth. [O/R]
Brent crude futures (LCOc1) fell back to $40.45 a barrel after bouncing back from a three-month low overnight. U.S. crude futures (CLc1) slipped 0.8% to $37.68 a barrel.
Bond buyers also returned after a tepid response to a $35 billion U.S. 10-year auction overnight, pushing the yield on U.S. 10-year debt down by a whisker to 0.6968%. 
EURO WAITS FOR ECB
Most 10-year bond yields in the euro area were little changed with calm in markets expected to prevail ahead of the ECB policy decision at 1145 GMT and news conference at 1230 GMT.
Earlier concerns that the bank may turn dovish, or sound worried about the euro's rise, have given way to an expectation that it will be hard to justify more bond buying if it does inch up its economic forecasts.
""The risk now is that the euro could lift after the ECB meeting, if that is the case and there is more confidence,"" said Commonwealth Bank of Australia (OTC:CMWAY) currency analyst Kim Mundy, something that would pull other currencies higher with it.
The pound  was a touch higher too ahead of emergency talks between Britain and the European Union after a British proposal to ignore parts of the Brexit divorce pact threw trade negotiations into turmoil.
Sterling last sat at $1.3006 and 90.91 pence per euro (EURGBP=).
U.S. jobless claims figures are due at 1230 GMT, and investors are also intently focused on whether the U.S. stock market bounce can actually hold firm.
Wednesday's Nasdaq rebound has recouped about a quarter of the index's losses since it plunged from a record high on Sept. 2, but it has also highlighted how stretched some stocks are.
""It's too soon to say whether the rout is over, or whether last night's recovery is simply a pause,"" ANZ analysts said in a note on Thursday.
Gold  was steady at $1,947 an ounce.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Singapore Airlines Ltd (SI:SIAL) said on Thursday it would cut 4,300 positions, or around 20% of its staff, due to the debilitating impact of the coronavirus pandemic on demand in the largest job losses in its history.
The airline said after taking into account a recruitment freeze, natural attrition and voluntary departure schemes, the potential number of staff affected would be reduced to around 2,400 in Singapore and overseas. 
The company reiterated its forecast that it expected to operate less than 50% of its normal capacity by its financial year end of March 31, 2021. It is currently at 8%.
The airline has no domestic network and is wholly dependent on international demand at a time when many borders remain effectively closed. 
It said to remain viable in an uncertain landscape it would operate a smaller fleet and reduced network in coming years, having already announced a review of its Airbus SE (PA:AIR) A380 planes for a possible S$1 billion ($731.21 million) in impairments.
The job losses on Thursday were the first it had announced since the start of the pandemic, which has seen it raise S$11 billion of equity and debt to shore up its liquidity.
""The next few weeks will be some of the toughest in the history of the SIA Group as some of our friends and colleagues leave the company,"" Singapore Airlines Chief Executive Goh Choon Phong said in a statement. 
""This is not a reflection of the strengths and capabilities of those who will be affected, but the result of an unprecedented global crisis that has engulfed the airline industry,"" he said.
State investor Temasek Holdings and others put together a $13.3 billion rescue package for Singapore Airlines in March, 
including a bridging loan it has repaid and S$9.7 billion of convertible notes it has yet to use.
The International Air Transport Association has forecast it will take until 2024 for global passenger traffic to return to pre-pandemic levels.
Rival Qantas Airways Ltd (AX:QAN) has announced plans to cut nearly 30% of its pre-pandemic staffing, while Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd (HK:0293) is reviewing its operations with an announcement expected in the fourth quarter.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are set to open lower Thursday, after the sharp rebound during the previous session, with investors cautious ahead of the release of key unemployment data. 
At 7 AM ET (1100 GMT), S&P 500 Futures traded 20 points, or 0.6%, lower, the Dow Futures contract fell 160 points, or 0.6%, while Nasdaq 100 Futures dropped 56 points, or 0.5%. 
The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index posted its steepest rise in more than four months on Wednesday, gaining 2.7%, to halt a three-session slump, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.6% and the S&P 500 climbed 2%.
Investors are grappling with whether the recent steep U.S. tech selloff is largely over, and beyond that the strength of the economic recovery amid an increasingly uncertain U.S. political outlook.
Focus will turn to the release of the weekly initial jobless claims, at 8:30 AM ET, which are expected to be 846,000, down from 881,000 the previous week. Continuing jobless claims, which come out at the same time, are expected to number 12.9 million, down from 13.2 million the previous week. 
There will also be producer price inflation data for August.
“With a range of data pointing to a levelling off in activity since July it is likely that unemployment stays persistently high and that the U.S. economy will not fully recoup all its lost output before mid-2022 unless there is a new large fiscal stimulus and good news on a vaccine,” said analyst James Knightley at ING, in a note.
A vote in the Senate is set to take place later Thursday on the Republicans' $500 billion coronavirus relief-bill proposal - the first formal vote of the Senate on the subject since March. However, the bill is unlikely to proceed as the Democrats who control the House of Representatives say it fails to take account of the gravity of the crisis. 
This could well be the final vote on coronavirus relief in Congress before the hotly-contested presidential and congressional elections in early November.
In corporate news, two companies which are seen as benefiting from the coronavirus-inspired lockdowns report earnings Thursday after the closing bell, namely stay-at-home exercise cult favorite Peloton Interactive (NASDAQ:PTON) and tech giant Oracle (NYSE:ORCL). 
Oil prices slipped back Thursday, after the American Petroleum Institute on Wednesday reported a 2.97 million barrel-build in the country’s crude stockpiles last week, raising concerns about the strength of the demand recovery.

LONDON (Reuters) - Airlines including British Airways and easyJet (L:EZJ) urged the UK government on Thursday to introduce coronavirus testing as an alternative to quarantine by the end of the month, in what they described as a ""last chance"" to save the industry. 
Ministers have said in recent days they are looking at introducing testing to reduce the current 14-day quarantine rule for arrivals into Britain from countries with high virus rates, a rule that has left the travel industry reeling.
But Airlines UK, an industry body representing British Airways (BA), easyJet, Ryanair (I:RYA), Virgin Atlantic, TUI (L:TUIT), Jet2 (L:DTG) and others, said action was needed before the end of September. 
""We urge you to announce and implement a policy on testing before the end of this month,"" Airlines UK said in the letter to the Prime Minister Boris Johnson. 
""The stakes could not be higher. We risk economic ruin otherwise."" 
BA-owner IAG (L:ICAG) on Thursday joined easyJet and Ryanair in warning that travel demand had weakened lately due to quarantine rules, dashing airline hopes for a recovery after the pandemic grounded fleets for months.
In the letter, Airlines UK told Johnson that if he wanted Britain, currently engaged in emergency Brexit talks, to retain its international connections, he needed to introduce the testing regime and other support for the industry before it was too late. 
""You must grasp this last chance to save the aviation industry, and with it so much prosperity across the UK,"" the letter said. 
UK-based airlines have already announced or started consultations on over 30,000 job losses and more could follow at airports and in related sectors. Further losses are expected in winter, traditionally the travel industry's weaker season.
Germany and France are already ahead with testing, the letter warned. 

The airlines want the government to give the green light to a plan that would mean travellers could avoid a 14-day quarantine if they have a negative virus test at the airport and again five days later.

Investing.com -- Another day, another sign of the travel industry struggling to escape the clutches of Covid-19.
International Airlines Group (LON:ICAG), the parent of British Airways, Iberia, Aer Lingus and Vueling, has had to price its 2.7 billion euro capital raise at a 36% discount to the reference price, a stark illustration of how hard it’s getting to persuade private investors to put capital into an industry which can struggle to make sustainable profits in the best of times.
IAG became the latest big airline group on Thursday to revise down its outlook for the fourth quarter of this year saying it now expects Available Seat Kilometers, a key metric of capacity, to be down 60% from year-earlier levels, rather than the previously expected 46% drop. For 2021, it revised its forecasts for ASKs to 27% below 2019 levels, from a previous estimated drop of 24%.
“Since July, IAG has experienced an overall levelling off of bookings,” the group said in a statement. “Short-haul bookings have fallen slightly following the re-implementation of quarantine requirements by the U.K. and other European governments for travellers returning from specific countries including Spain.”
The most optimistic thing it could say was that its more lucrative long-haul business has registered a “modest increase” since August, and that “where travel markets have reopened without border restrictions and quarantine requirements, IAG has been encouraged by the level of pent-up demand that exists for air travel.”
IAG shares fell 3.8% to a three-week low in response, underperforming both the FTSE 100 and the IBEX 35. They weren’t helped by some unfortunate-sounding lobbying from the International Air Travel Association, which warned that the U.K. aviation industry, the backbone of IAG’s business, is in existential crisis.
“Without a rescue plan, 820,000 jobs will be vaporized by quarantine and they may never come back,” IATA said in a statement that called for a new airport testing regime, a suspension of Air Passenger Duty and the extension of the government’s furlough scheme “until border restrictions are lifted and the industry has a chance to recover.”
IAG does at least expect to break even on an operating cash flow level even under its new assumptions. However, it warned that it still expects that passenger demand will return to 2019 levels no earlier than 2023.
IAG wasn’t the only travel group scrambling to raise money on Thursday. UK-based  Saga  (LON:SAGA), which specializes in selling holidays and insurance to the over-50s, said it will try to raise 150 million pounds to plug the holes in its balance sheet made by the pandemic.  The company swung to a pretax loss of 55 million pounds in the six months through July, sending net debt (excluding its cruise business) to 3.6 times EBITDA.
Saga shares had already lost nearly 70% year-to-date before the announcement and fell another 5.4% in the wake of it."

""Latest developments in the Eurozone and especially the improvement in economic data rules out further easing for now, but given that the number of COVID-19 cases are rising again and negotiations with the UK over Brexit are not going well, the risks are mounting,"" Sayed said
Britain and the EU will hold emergency discussions on Thursday over Prime Minister Boris Johnson's plan to undercut parts of the Brexit divorce treaty.

OSLO/LONDON (Reuters) - BP (NYSE:BP) entered the offshore wind market on Thursday with a $1.1 billion deal to buy 50% stakes in two U.S. developments from Norway's Equinor, a significant step by the oil firm towards its energy transition goals.
The British oil and gas company has set itself a target of increasing its renewable power generation capacity 20 fold over the coming decade to 50 gigawatts (GW), a key pillar of its strategy to slash carbon emissions..
""This is an important early step in the delivery of our new strategy and our pivot to truly becoming an integrated energy company,"" BP Chief Executive Bernard Looney said in a statement.
European oil firms are under pressure from activists, banks, investors and some governments to shift away from fossil fuels and analysts say offshore wind farms are probably the quickest way for them to scale up.
The deal with Equinor, which could be followed by further joint expansion, makes BP co-owner of the Empire Wind project off New York and Beacon Wind off Massachusetts, which could together generate up to 4.4 GW - enough power for more than two million homes.
Equinor expects to book capital gains of roughly $1 billion from the transaction, an executive at the state-controlled firm told Reuters.
""It confirms that our strategy to get early access to the U.S. coast was right and it created the value,"" Equinor's head of renewable energy Paal Eitrheim said.
The two companies are establishing a strategic partnership for further growth in offshore wind in the United States, with both bottom-fixed and floating facilities.
""The transaction is in line with Equinor's renewable strategy to access attractive acreage early and at scale, mature projects, and capture value,"" it said.
Equinor, which will remain the operator of the projects through the development, construction and operation phases, said the deal is expected to close in early 2021.
BP already has a large onshore wind business in the United States with a capacity of around 1.7 GW, but has refrained in the past from entering the offshore wind market.
The deal challenges any assumption that renewable projects can't offer returns on the scale offered by oil and gas, and is likely to increase the market's confidence in Equinor's offshore wind business, Sparebank 1 Markets analyst Teodor Sveen-Nilsen said.

""This is a platform for growth and we can do more together than we could do alone,"" Equinor's Eitrheim said of the BP deal.

Money has flowed into a range of sustainable investments in recent years as policymakers look to retool the financial system in the fight against climate change and ""build back better"" from the economic ravages of the COVID-19 pandemic.
UBS, which manages $2.6 trillion in assets for some of the world's wealthiest people, said it believed a 100% sustainable portfolio could deliver the same or potentially higher returns and also offer strong diversification benefits to clients.
""The shift in preferences toward sustainable products and services is only just beginning,"" said Iqbal Khan, co-president of UBS Global Wealth Management. 
""We believe sustainable investments will prove to be one of the most exciting and durable opportunities for private clients in the years and decades ahead.""
UBS said clients currently have around $500 billion invested in its ""core"" sustainable assets, such as Green Bonds and low-carbon index funds.
While traditional investments such as plain vanilla bonds or a mainstream stock index would still be more suitable in some circumstances, UBS said the coronavirus pandemic had fuelled its belief that a fundamental shift in markets was underway.
""COVID-19 has put the exclamation point on one of the most important shifts in financial services in a generation,"" said Tom Naratil, co-president of UBS Global Wealth Management and president of UBS Americas. 

""The pandemic has brought the vulnerability and interconnected nature of our societies and industries to the forefront of investors’ minds and shown that sustainability considerations cannot be ignored.""

The employee leaked information on transactions affecting 275 corporate clients, mostly financial institutions, to a Tokyo-based brokerage called Nippon Institutional Securities, Nomura said in a statement. 
The information was related to trading in ETFs (exchange-traded funds), but a Nomura spokesman did not elaborate. 
Nomura said the information was leaked to a former employee of Nomura who works at Nippon Institutional, an unit of asset manager Nikko Asset Management. 
Nomura said it is considering taking strict measures against this employee, whom the brokerage did not identify, and it would strengthen its information management system. 
In a separate statement, Nippon Institutional said an employee who joined the firm from Nomura in October obtained client information between January and July through a Nomura Securities employee.

Profit excluding some items and accounting adjustments dropped 38% to 17.3 billion rand ($1.04 billion) in the 12 months through June, Johannesburg-based FirstRand said in a statement on Thursday. It didn’t declare a final dividend in line with guidance from South Africa’s central bank for lenders to preserve their capital levels.
While there’s been an improvement since South Africa eased lockdown restrictions aimed at containing the Covid-19 outbreak, activity levels will remain muted, the lender said. FirstRand anticipates an “upward trajectory” in profit in the six months through June 2021, its fiscal second half, “although the absolute level of earnings on a year-on-year basis are unlikely to revert back to June 2020 levels.”
Credit provisions at South African banks have soared after the government shuttered all businesses except essential services at the onset of the outbreak, compounding the woes of an economy already battling a recession and 30% unemployment. While Absa Group Ltd., one of three local lenders to report first-half results last month, indicated a slightly better outlook for the rest of the year, banks have battled to give clear guidance amid ongoing uncertainty caused by the virus.
South Africa Heading Toward Becoming a Failed State, Group Says
“Activity levels will remain muted on a relative basis, balance-sheet growth will be subdued, and the credit performance will not materially improve,” FirstRand said. “Given the South African government’s limited capacity to inject further stimulus into the economy, there will be ongoing permanent damage to household and business balance sheets.”
Still, the industry remains well-capitalized and has stepped in to help the government disburse a 200 billion rand state-guaranteed loan program to aid small- and medium-sized businesses hammered by lockdown restrictions. Independent of the government’s efforts, lenders have also restructured credit and offered other relief to cash-strapped customers and businesses.
Shares in FirstRand are down 35% this year compared with a 37% slump in the six-member FTSE/JSE Africa Banks Index. Its performance lags that of Standard Bank Group Ltd., the continent’s biggest lender by assets, and Capitec Bank Holdings Ltd.

Investing.com - European stock markets are trading lower Thursday ahead of the latest policy meeting of the European Central Bank, with the corporate environment remaining challenging.
At 3:50 AM ET (0750 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.1% lower, the CAC 40 in France fell 0.3% and the U.K.'s FTSE index was down 0.6%.
The latest meeting of the European Central Bank will be the market’s focus, with its policy decision due at 7:45 AM ET (1145 GMT), followed 45 minutes later by a news conference from President Christine Lagarde.
The central bank is scheduled to release its staff’s new economic forecasts and there may be comments about its ongoing strategy review. But the main interest is whether it tries to weaken the single currency given the importance of the export sector for the region.
“The Governing Council is likely to flag the recent euro appreciation, noting that the volatility in the currency requires monitoring,” said analysts at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), in a note. “But we see a high bar for policy action given that ECB officials have historically not eased policy when euro strength predominantly reflected improving economic prospects.”
In corporate news, the damage the virus has done to the travel sector was illustrated by IAG (LON:ICAG), the owner of British Airways, planning a capital raise of 2.74 billion euros to repair its balance sheet. Its stock climbed 1.8% despite the new shares being priced at a 36% discount to the theoretical ex-rights price.
 Saga  (LON:SAGA) stock dropped 5.5% after the company, which specializes in products for over 50s, announced a 150 million-pound capital raise to plug the holes left by heavy losses at its cruise and other travel operations.
WM Morrison Supermarkets (LON:MRW) stock fell 4.5% despite sales surging in the first half of its financial year. Profits dropped because of coronavirus-related costs.
Overnight in the U.S., the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index posted its steepest rise in more than four months, gaining 2.7%, to halt a three-session slump that had cast doubt over the valuations of the mega cap tech stocks which had driven the market’s strong recovery. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.6% and the S&P 500 climbed 2%, in conjunction.
Oil prices slipped back Thursday, as a rise in U.S. crude inventories prompted concerns about faltering demand just as the peak driving season came to an end.
The American Petroleum Institute on Wednesday reported a 2.97 million barrel-build in the country’s crude stockpiles for the week ending September 4, compared with the 1.4 million draw widely forecast.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration will release official weekly inventory data later on Thursday, a day later than normal following the U.S. Labor Day holiday.
U.S. crude futures traded 1.4% lower at $37.53 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract fell 1.1% to $40.34.
Elsewhere, gold futures fell 0.1% to $1,952.35/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% higher at 1.1818.

68,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 10, 2020 03:45AM ET</span>",Yum China Set for Weakest Hong Kong Debut in More Than Year,"(Bloomberg) -- Yum China Holdings (NYSE:YUMC) Inc. is on pace to have the worst debut in more than a year among billion-dollar listings in Hong Kong.
The operator of KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell restaurants in China fell as much as 6.3% following its $2.2 billion secondary offering. That would be the poorest first-day performance among companies selling at least $1 billion of stock in Hong Kong since Shenwan Hongyuan Group Co. in April 2019, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Yum China is also poised to be the first U.S.-listed firm to slip on day one since  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd. started the current run last November of having shares also trade in Hong Kong.
U.S. market volatility and the outlook for American brands amid escalating tensions with China have cast a cloud over Yum China’s offering. Its U.S. shares have retreated 7.8% this month to their lowest since early August. The tensions are not a big concern for Yum China, Chief Executive Officer Joey Wat told Bloomberg TV on Thursday morning. She added the company still aims to open at least 800 stores in China this year.
The losing commencement by Yum China contrasts with what’s been a hot market for initial public offerings in Hong Kong. IPOs this year raised a combined HK$147.7 billion ($19.1 billion) through August, 74% above year-earlier levels, according to data from Hong Kong’s stock exchange operator. The pipeline remains strong for the remainder of the year, highlighted by Ant Group Co.’s plan to go public next month in both Hong Kong and Shanghai.
Yum China’s new shares were 52 times subscribed by retail investors, a ratio that beat nearly two-thirds of new offerings in the city this year, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The company’s fundraising schedule clashed with the IPO by Nongfu Spring Co., whose retail oversubscription rate topped 1,100.
New offerings have been particularly popular with Hong Kong retail investors this year, as ample liquidity encouraged banks to lend and more technology firms list in the city, spurred by restrictions imposed on some in the U.S. Seven of the 10 best IPO debuts in Hong Kong the past decade took place this year, based on deals that raised more than $100 million, Bloomberg data show. Also, one-third of Hong Kong’s 36 total IPOs since June 1 saw first-day price declines.
“We feel this year is a right time to do it because the Hong Kong IPO market is doing incredibly well,” Wat said in an interview with Bloomberg. “Hong Kong investors know the business in China a lot better than investors in other places.”
Yum China continues to target opening 800 to 850 new stores this year despite impacts from the coronavirus. Wat said the company has been able to get better locations, especially in top-tier cities, as smaller peers had to leave the market. The firm’s overall store count hit 10,000 in July, helped by April’s acquisition of a controlling interest in Huang Ji Huang. That chain has more than 600 restaurants.
“The outlook for China’s fast-food sector is promising, as demand is strong and new players are still attracted to enter the market,” said Wat. She added it may not be a bad thing for Yum China that consumer spending slows in the country since people with tighter budgets may opt to go to the likes of KFC.
China’s retail sales at restaurants and catering businesses fell 11% from a year earlier in July, lagging other consumer segments. When reporting second-quarter results, Yum China reported a sputtering recovery from the pandemic, with sales improving in April and May but weakening again in June. Sales were expected to remain under pressure this quarter.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Some of Wall Street’s biggest players are viewing the stock market's recent tech-led selloff as a bout of turbulence rather than the start of a longer slide -- and they don't see it as a reason to run for the door. 
Invesco this week called the Nasdaq's sharp decline a “healthy period of consolidation” while fund manager Lord Abbett said U.S. stock valuations are likely merited, based on an analysis of companies’ earnings. 
On Sept. 4, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) reiterated its year-end price target of 3,600 on the S&P 500, roughly 6% above the index's close on Wednesday, while UBS Global Wealth Management recommended clients “ease into the markets” rather than stay on the sidelines. 
Their optimism highlights how the Federal Reserve's pledge to keep interest rates at record lows and hopes of a breakthrough in a vaccine for COVID-19 have underpinned market gains this year, though many remain wary that the U.S. presidential election and massive options bets on tech-related stocks could exacerbate market swings in the remaining months of 2020. 
""What we think we are going through is a healthy correction, removing the froth,"" said Troy Gayeski, co-chief investment officer of SkyBridge, an alternative investments firm. ""We certainly could fall more. But if you're a tech investor you had to understand that the valuations were very high.""
The Nasdaq posted its best day since April on Wednesday, a day after falling into correction territory, commonly defined as a fall of 10% or more from a recent peak. The other major indexes also rebounded on Wednesday after steep declines. 
""I think of this rout not so much as a correction, but as a digestion,"" Kristina Hooper, Invesco's chief global market strategist, said in a recent note.
Second-quarter reported earnings on the S&P 500 were 23.1% above expectations, far above the trailing five-year average of 4.7%, analysts at Lord Abbett said in a recent note. 
""Earnings momentum, and the magnitude of analyst earnings revisions, is outpacing that in other markets, suggesting that higher valuations on U.S. equities are merited,"" the report said.
Still, some believe more volatility is in store. A recent poll of investors from UBS Global Wealth Management showed 65% viewed politics as their top concern, with the Nov. 3 U.S. presidential election just weeks away. 
Prominent investor Stanley Druckenmiller - a skeptic of this year's rally - again sounded a bearish note on Wednesday, warning on CNBC https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/09/stanley-druckenmiller-says-were-in-a-raging-mania-and-the-next-3-to-5-years-will-be-challenging.html that the stock market is in a mania fueled by the Federal Reserve.
Uncertainty over huge options purchases by SoftBank Group Corp (T:9984) also hung over markets, creating another risk. 
Gayeski, of Skybridge, said he could see an opportunity to increase equity risk if there was a sharper drop, such as the Nasdaq falling 20% or the S&P 500 declining 15% from their respective highs and there were other supportive signs for the market such as the Fed's expanding its balance sheet further.
Any selling that spreads beyond the big tech-related stocks that have led markets higher could be an indication that the pullback may be extending further, said Willie Delwiche, an investment strategist at Baird. 
In the coming days, Delwiche is looking for signs of increasing investor caution -- such as buying of put options, outflows from equity funds and diminishing bullish views in surveys -- that indicate any over-exuberance has waned.
Another indicator is how investors respond to key technical support levels, said Keith Lerner, chief market strategist for Truist/SunTrust Advisory. The Nasdaq, for example, on Tuesday closed below its 50-day moving average for the first time since April, but was back above it on Wednesday.

""If you see these markets just slice through support levels, that’s a sign that the sellers have the upper hand,” Lerner said.

Australian companies are rushing to review their codes of conduct and have made the issue a priority after incidents of misconduct recently came to light at AMP and QBE Insurance Group (AX:QBE). 
Symmetra's review will objectively assess conduct at the workplace, and make recommendations on policies, leadership, governance and behaviours, AMP said in a statement.
AMP was forced to demote the head of its fund management unit, Boe Pahari, in August over comments he made to a female colleague in 2017 which breached the company's code of conduct. Its chairman David Murray also resigned in the fallout as the board had supported Pahari's promotion despite knowing about the conduct issues.
Pahari has said he ""deeply"" regrets ""the events in 2017"" and Murray said he stepped down to take accountability for the board's decision in response to investor concerns.
Last week, QBE Insurance Group Ltd said its Chief Executive Patrick Regan would leave the company following an investigation that found he had fallen short of its ethics and conduct standards. Regan has not publicly commented on the matter.

The sausage patty, made from soy protein, is the Silicon Valley-based company's second product since its faux beef burger in 2016.
It launched the Impossible Sausage in the United States earlier this year.
Asia is a key growth area, said Chief Executive Pat Brown, as the company aims to capitalize on the region's high consumption of pork. 
""Consumers are accelerating the shift to a plant-based food system. This is particularly true in Asia where pork dominates the meat market,"" he told an online news briefing.
Producing plant-based food and beverages is less demanding on the environment compared with items relying on animal agriculture, which typically needs far more land and water.
Pork is the world's most widely eaten meat, accounting for 36% of intake, showed data from the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization.
David Lee, Impossible's chief financial officer, said the Impossible Sausage would be available in Hong Kong at  Starbucks Corp  (O:SBUX) cafes as well as restaurants including burger joint Triple O's from this month.
In August, Impossible said it secured $200 million in funding, less than six months after raising the largest-ever amount for a food tech startup, bringing total funds raised since its 2011 founding to $1.5 billion.
Impossible Sausage's Hong Kong debut comes more than two years after home-grown OmniPork launched its mock pork product in supermarkets and restaurants across the city. 
Demand for plant-based protein foods has surged in Asia, suppliers said, as suspicion over links between wild animal meat and the novel coronavirus prompts a diet rethink, particularly in Hong Kong and mainland China.

Starbucks this week said it was adding plant-based food and beverages to menus across Asia.

Individuals who fraudulently obtained loans under the Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL) program had not been acting as JPMorgan employees, the person said. 
However, breaking the law was a violation of the bank's code of conduct and some people were fired as a result of their improper EIDL applications, the person added.
The lender found that some of its own staff had deposited suspicious EIDL funds in their Chase checking accounts, according to the report. 
Those cases accounted for a ""very small"" percentage of the total suspicious activity uncovered by JPMorgan, the person said.
Reuters reported on Tuesday that the lender was probing employees who may have been involved in the misuse of funds intended for COVID-19 relief, citing an internal memo.

MILAN (Reuters) - After more than a year in a tailspin, Italian sports car brand Maserati unveiled on Wednesday a new high performance sports car, part of a bid by parent  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles NV (MI:FCHA) to revive its premium vehicle strategy heading into its merger with French automaker  Peugeot  SA (PA:PEUP).
The Maserati MC20 rollout in Italy's auto city of Modena is part of a parade of new vehicles planned between now and 2023 to bolster Fiat Chrysler's presence in the global high-end auto market. Germany's Porsche,  Ferrari  NV (MI:RACE), Britain's  Aston Martin  Lagonda (L:AML), Tesla Inc's (O:TSLA) Model S and Model X, and others represent tough competition.
The MC20 will launch with an internal combustion engine, with a full-electric version expected later.
Maserati has a crucial role in Stellantis, the new group stemming from the planned merger of FCA and PSA. The joint portfolio has no other global luxury brand besides top-of-the-line Jeep and Ram truck models that sell for luxury vehicle prices in North America.
PSA Chief Executive Carlos Tavares, who will head Stellantis, has said he sees no need to scrap any brands after the merger.
""I can imagine Tavares actually being quite keen on having the likes of Maserati as part of the wider group,"" IHS Markit analyst Ian Fletcher said.
Fiat Chrysler CEO Mike Manley has been investing in Maserati despite the brand's poor performance. The brand had a 199 million euro ($235 million) operating loss last year, as shipments plunged 45% worldwide.
In the second quarter, hard hit by the COVID-19 epidemic, Maserati's operating loss totaled 99 million euros, shipments fell by 52%, and margins shrank 53.5%. 
Still, Manley has stuck to a multi-year plan to resurrect the brand, which would give Fiat Chrysler a foothold in the lucrative global luxury vehicle segment if the company can find the right combination of style, technology and performance to compete against Tesla, the German luxury brands and Ferrari.
FCA said last year Maserati would get a significant portion of 5 billion euros planned for investment in Italy through 2021.
""We're now getting to the point where those investments will begin to hit the marketplace,"" Manley said in July. ""My expectation ... is that we'll begin to see some solid progress on that front in Q4, which will continue as we get through to 2021.""

Maserati earlier this year issued a hybrid version of its Ghibli luxury sedan, and plans to launch between 2021 and 2022 a new SUV and redesigned GranTurismo and GranCabrio models, the brand's first full-electric cars.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - J.C. Penney Co Inc reached a tentative deal with landlords and lenders valued at $1.75 billion to rescue the beleaguered department store chain from bankruptcy proceedings, averting a liquidation that would have threatened roughly 70,000 jobs and represented one of the most significant business collapses following the coronavirus pandemic, a company lawyer said.
Mall owners Simon Property Group Inc (NYSE:SPG) and Brookfield Property Partners (NASDAQ:BPY) LP have teamed up to acquire J.C. Penney’s retail operations and are putting the finishing touches on an agreement, Joshua Sussberg, a Kirkland & Ellis LLP lawyer representing the company, said during a brief court hearing Wednesday, confirming an earlier Reuters report. 
The deal would carve J.C. Penney into three pieces. In addition to the retail operations the landlords are purchasing, lenders would take control of two other entities housing some J.C. Penney stores and the retailer's distribution centers. 
The landlords are poised to put $300 million toward the rescue and have agreed to a nonbinding letter of intent with J.C. Penney, he said. The operating company they are acquiring would assume $500 million of debt. 
J.C. Penney plans to move at ""lightning speed"" to seek approval of the deal from a bankruptcy judge in early October, Sussberg said. ""We are in a position to move this into the endzone,"" he told U.S. Bankruptcy Judge David Jones, noting that previous talks were in the ""red zone"" before faltering and then gaining renewed traction.
J.C. Penney expects to emerge from bankruptcy before the 2020 holiday season, the company said.
The restructured retailer is expected to operate about 650 stores, people familiar with the matter previously told Reuters.
Hedge funds and private-equity firms financing J.C. Penney’s bankruptcy would take ownership of 161 of those stores and separate distribution centers after forgiving portions of the Plano, Texas-based company’s $5 billion debt load, Sussberg said. These lenders, led by H/2 Capital Partners, would own those assets in two separate property companies.
J.C. Penney is also in discussions with  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co for roughly $2 billion to finance its emergence from bankruptcy proceedings, Sussberg said. In the end, J.C. Penney will have about $1 billion of cash to fund its business when the deal closes, Sussberg said.
The iconic 118-year-old retailer, which went public at the start of the Great Depression, filed for bankruptcy in a Texas court in May after the pandemic forced it to temporarily close its then nearly 850 stores. 
Should it survive, J.C. Penney will have withstood unprecedented economic turmoil stemming from the pandemic and bankruptcy proceedings that have felled other retailers during less fraught times. In recent years, Toys ‘R’ Us Inc and Barneys New York Inc failed to reorganize under bankruptcy protection and liquidated. 
A deal is not yet completed, Sussberg cautioned. Talks with the landlords have hit roadblocks before, and the parties engaged in screaming matches as recently as Wednesday, he said. Negotiations continued during phone calls moments before the court hearing, he added.
If the discussions fall apart, J.C. Penney would likely be on course for liquidation, people familiar with the negotiations said. Sussberg expressed optimism a deal would be codified and the judge encouraged the parties to keep working to seal an agreement.
Simon, Brookfield and a lawyer for the lenders did not respond to earlier requests for comment.
J.C. Penney’s survival hinges on the sale negotiations, which have consumed the summer and drawn urgent directives from the company’s bankruptcy judge for parties to set aside what he labeled egos and negotiating postures to consummate a deal to save the beleaguered retailer.
The talks have dragged on for weeks in part amid haggling over lease terms, the people said. In late August, the discussions with Simon and Brookfield reached an impasse, prompting J.C. Penney to ask lenders to take control of its retail operations in addition to the real estate investment trusts they envisioned owning. After further discussions, the company reached a deal with Simon and Brookfield to buy the retail operations. 
Any deal would require approval from the company's bankruptcy judge and be subject to competing bids in a looming court-supervised auction. Private equity firm Sycamore Partners and Saks Fifth Avenue owner Hudson’s Bay Co also vied for J.C. Penney’s retail business earlier this summer, according to people familiar with the matter.
For Simon and Brookfield, the deal talks reflect a dramatic shift following the pandemic that is pushing them to rescue faltering retailers occupying malls they own across the United States. The demise of large tenants such as J.C. Penney would deprive them of rent and also potentially trigger contract clauses allowing other retailers to pay them less or break their leases altogether, further darkening malls. 
Simon, the largest mall operator in the United States, has already this year negotiated separate deals to rescue the two-centuries-old men's apparel clothier Brooks Brothers and denim retailer Lucky Brand from bankruptcy. Brookfield in May said it would devote $5 billion to non-controlling investments designed to revitalize retailers struggling in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak. 

The pandemic has forced Neiman Marcus Group and J. Crew Group Inc to seek bankruptcy protection, and even retailers that have avoided restructurings, such as Gap Inc (NYSE:GPS), have at times stopped paying rent or tried to negotiate lower payments.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -  Boeing Co  (N:BA) is submitting to an independent review of its compliance and ethics practices, according to an agreement struck with NASA and the U.S. Air Force and seen by Reuters, part of widening fallout from its behavior in bidding to supply lunar landing vehicles. 
The agreement, signed in August, comes as federal prosecutors continue a criminal investigation into whether NASA's former human exploration chief, Doug Loverro, improperly guided Boeing space executive Jim Chilton during the contract bidding process.
By agreeing to the ""Compliance Program Enhancements"", the aerospace heavyweight staves off harsher consequences from NASA and the Air Force - its space division's top customers - such as being suspended or debarred from bidding on future space contracts.
The agreement calls for Boeing to pay a ""third party expert"" to assess its ethics and compliance programs and review training procedures for executives who liaise with government officials, citing ""concerns related to procurement integrity"" during NASA's Human Landing System competition.
Since Loverro resigned in May, Boeing has fired one company attorney and a group of mid-level employees, three people familiar with the actions told Reuters. 
Boeing has also revised its internal Procurement Integrity Act procedures, and disseminated new training materials to employees, according to the agreement. 
""We did not meet our own high expectations, or those of our customer, in the (human landing systems) procurement,"" Boeing spokesman Damien Mills told Reuters on Wednesday.
""We appreciate the productive dialogue we have had with the agencies and believe that the agreement will help to ensure that we will meet those expectations in the future,"" Mills added.
Boeing's space business was already under NASA scrutiny for its botched 2019 test flight of its Starliner space capsule.
NASA did not return requests for comment. An attorney for Loverro declined to comment. The Air Force did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The agreement requires Boeing to meet quarterly with NASA and Air Force officials through 2022 to provide updates on its ethics and compliance improvement efforts. 
The agreement and criminal probe stem from NASA's most ambitious space exploration endeavor: sending humans back to the moon by 2024 under a hastened timeline set by the Trump administration in 2019.

In April, NASA bypassed Boeing and awarded contracts worth a combined $1 billion to Elon Musk's SpaceX, Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin, and Leidos Inc affiliate Dynetics to build lunar landing vehicles that can carry astronauts to the moon by 2024.

- Spanish paper producer Lecta Group, formerly owned by private equity group CVC, was taken over by bondholders at the end of 2019 and is still working on a recapitalization. 
- British shopping center operator Intu Properties  is in talks with shareholders and potential new investors to raise funds to shore up its balance sheet. 
-  Seadrill  (OL:SDRL) (N:SDRL), controlled by Norwegian-born shipping tycoon John Fredriksen, has written down the value of its oil drilling rigs by $1.2 billion and hired bankers and lawyers to evaluate a financial restructuring. Its debt stands at $7.5 billion.
U.S. COMPANIES
- J.C. Penney Co Inc reached a reached a tentative deal with landlords and lenders valued at $1.75 billion to rescue it from bankruptcy proceedings, averting a liquidation that would have threatened roughly 70,000 jobs.
- Neiman Marcus Group is expected to emerge from Chapter 11 bankruptcy by the end of this month under a restructuring plan that is likely to eliminate more than $4 billion of its debt. 
- Chesapeake Energy Corp (N:CHK) filed for Chapter 11, becoming the largest U.S. oil and gas producer to seek bankruptcy protection in recent years. It entered into a restructuring support agreement, which has the backing of lenders to its main revolving credit facility.
- U.S. shale producer  Whiting Petroleum Corp  (N:WLL) said in September it had emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy and completed its financial restructuring, shrinking its funded debt by about $3 billion.
- U.S. energy producer  Denbury Resources Inc  (OTC:DNRCQ) said it expects to emerge from Chapter 11 in mid-September, with a bankruptcy court confirming a ""pre-packaged"" plan to restructure its balance sheet and eliminate $2.1 billion of bond debt

- J. Crew Group Inc could emerge from Chapter 11 in September, after its restructuring plan was approved by a bankruptcy court. The plan will equitize over $1.6 billion of secured debt and provide for $400 million in asset-based loans as well as $400 million of fresh financial aid.

TORONTO (Reuters) - The Canadian government has teamed up with some of the country's largest financial institutions to launch a C$221 million ($168 million) program for Black entrepreneurs to access credit and help them bounce back from the pandemic-induced economic slump.
In a joint announcement on Wednesday, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Minister of Small Business, Export Promotion and International Trade Mary Ng said Canada would spend nearly C$93 million over the next four years to administer the program.
The rest of the C$128 million would be provided by financial institutions that have partnered with the government for the Black Entrepreneurship Loan Fund.
""With Canada's first-ever Black Entrepreneurship Program, our government is taking real action to support Black entrepreneurs recovering from COVID-19, and empower them to start up, innovate, grow and succeed,"" Ng said.
The government initiative follows a wave of Black Lives Matter protests in both the United States and Canada and calls that Trudeau do more to address deep systemic inequities faced by Black Canadians.
The prime minister himself faced criticism last year after images showing him in brown face makeup at a 2001 “Arabian Nights” party when he was a 29-year-old teacher emerged just weeks before the federal election.
Trudeau later apologized for his actions.
The federal government is teaming up with Vancity, a Vancouver-based financial cooperative, and seven other Canadian financial institutions, including the top banks.
Under the program, Black-led business organizations can access between C$25,000 and C$250,000 through the fund to start a business.

""The pandemic has shone a light on the inequalities that disproportionately hurt Black Canadians, and has underscored the need to restart our economy in a way that allows all Canadians an equal chance to succeed, "" Trudeau said.

Investing.com - Video game retailer GameStop reported wider-than-expected losses in the second quarter as sales were hurt by shuttered stores during the lockdown. 
GameStop (NYSE:GME) fell more than 4% in after-market trading.

Comparable store sales declined 12.7%, which was less than the feared consensus estimate for a 21.5% drop.
Gross margin declined 420 basis points from the prior-year period, driven by the increased mix of hardware sales, which carry a lower gross margin, the company said.

Investing.com -- Wall Street staged a rally on Wednesday, partially reversing a sharp drop in big tech stocks over the last few sessions.
Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) rebounded as did FANG stocks Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) and  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB).
NASDAQ Composite gained back 2.7% after dropping 10% in the last week after hitting an all-time high. Still, the tech-heavy index is up 24% this year. Some analysts said the pullback might represent necessary pause as investors digest market news rather than the beginning of a new dotcom bust. Time will tell.
Thursday will feature jobs and other economic data that could provide clues on the pace of the economic recovery. Already, data on job openings showed an increase in July, especially in retail, though the numbers also indicated more people were quitting jobs.
Jobless claims and oil inventory readings are due out in the morning, and earnings are due out from Peloton and Oracle.
Here are three things that could move markets tomorrow:
1. Jobless claims seen falling again
The weekly report on initial jobless claims comes out at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT). Analysts tracked by Investing.com expect 846,000, down from 881,000 the previous week. And continuing jobless claims, which come out at the same time, are expected to number 12.9 million, down from 13.2 million the previous week.
The downward trickle of new and continuing claims is a positive sign that the economy is coming back from the Covid-19 lockdowns, but there is still plenty of room for improvement, with the four-week jobless claims average running just under 1 million and a new pandemic economic relief program stalled in Congress.
2. Oil inventory expected to drop
The government's oil inventory data for last week is due out at 11:00 AM ET (1500 GMT). Stockpiles have been declining for weeks despite disruptions like Hurricane Laura, which ripped through the Gulf Coast last month.
Analysts tracked by Investing.com are expecting crude inventory to drop 1.3 million barrels after a draw of 9.4 million barrels the previous week. Oil stored at the Cushing, Oklahoma, facility is expected to increase 391,000 barrels after a build of 110,000 the previous week. Gasoline stocks are expected to decline 2.4 million barrels, after a draw of 4.3 million the previous week.
3. Earnings from two companies that are seen benefiting from lockdowns
On the earnings front, stay-at-home exercise cult favorite  Peloton Interactive Inc  (NASDAQ:PTON) is expected to report profit of 9 cents a share on revenue of $580 million. The company benefitted from the pandemic shutdown of gyms across the U.S. and is expected to continue to grow despite gym reopenings this fall. On Tuesday, it even announced new, cheaper equipment and different pricing models.
Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL)also reports earnings, with profits expected to come in at 86 cents a share on revenue of more than $9 billion. Demand for cloud infrastructure services is expected to boost sales as companies and students adapted to stay-at-home working and learning. For example, pandemic star Zoom Video uses Oracle's cloud infrastructure services for its popular video conferencing service, according to Yahoo Finance.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.60%, or 439 points. The S&P 500 was up 2.02%, while the Nasdaq Composite added 2.71% to notch its best day since Apr. 29. 
The sea of red that has washed over tech for the three-straight trading sessions turned green, with Apple rising more than 5% as investors resumed their bullish bets on the tech giant ahead of its new iPhone launch widely expected later this year.

CHICAGO (Reuters) - A tentative deal between United Airlines (O:UAL) and the union representing its pilots would distribute the airline's flight schedule among a larger number of pilots in an effort to avert furloughs, two people familiar with the matter said on Wednesday.
Earlier, United and the union, which represents more than 13,000 pilots, said they had reached an agreement in principle to potentially save jobs, but declined to provide more information, saying details were still being worked out.
United has said that some 2,850 pilots were at risk of being furloughed without an extension of government aid as the industry weathers a severe downturn in demand because of the coronavirus pandemic.
The agreement, which would need to be ratified by union members, keeps the current contract intact and has advantages for pilots with seniority, the people said.
The top third of pilots, for example, would take a 10% reduction in the minimum amount of flying they are guaranteed every month, but would be able to pick up overtime, one person said.
By having more pilots on hand, United would be able to quickly tap into any temporary or quicker-than-expected rebounds in demand.
Earlier, Chicago-based United forecast a 70% year-over-year decline in third-quarter capacity and a bigger drop in passenger revenue than its previous expectation, but said it was adding new non-stop flights to Africa, India and Hawaii next year. 

U.S. airlines received $25 billion in payroll aid under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act in March and have been lobbying for a six-month extension to protect tens of thousands of jobs at risk when the first round expires this month.

(Reuters) - Major U.S. airlines warned on Wednesday that travel demand will continue to languish until there is a widespread COVID-19 vaccine, while awaiting developments in Washington on additional federal aid.
U.S. airlines received $25 billion in payroll grants under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act in March and have been lobbying for a six-month extension to protect tens of thousands of jobs at risk when the first round expires this month.
Union leaders met with senior congressional Democrats to discuss aid after a proposal from the Republican-led U.S. Senate on Tuesday for additional coronavirus relief did not include new government assistance for U.S. airlines or airports.
Republicans and Democrats have been jockeying for months over the next phase of coronavirus aid. Officials expect discussions to accelerate in the coming weeks, though it was not clear whether an agreement would be reached before the first $25 billion runs out this month.
Airlines continue to suffer a drastic downturn in demand due to the coronavirus pandemic, with the largest carriers each burning through around $1 billion of cash monthly.
The sector does not expect a meaningful recovery until there is a widely accepted COVID-19 treatment or vaccine, which could stimulate pent-up demand and the need for trained workers.
In a filing, United Airlines forecast a bigger drop in third-quarter passenger revenue than its previous expectation, but said it is adding new non-stop flights to Africa, India and Hawaii next year.
United also said it had reached an agreement in principle with its pilots union that could avert job losses for up to 2,850 pilots.
American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) told an online conference it could apply for more Treasury loans if other airlines do not take their share of a separate $25 billion available under the CARES Act.
Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV), for example, has already said it is not applying for the government loans.
American, with the largest debt load of its peers, is also discussing with Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co deferring the delivery of 18 737 MAX jets and eyeing other options to restore its balance sheet, Chief Financial Officer Derek Kerr said at an industry conference that was held virtually.

LONDON (Reuters) - AstraZeneca's (L:AZN) suspension of global trials of its experimental coronavirus vaccine after an unexplained illness in a study subject in Britain has cast doubt on prospects for an early rollout.
The vaccine, which Britain's AstraZeneca is developing with the University of Oxford, has been described by the World Health Organization as probably the world's leading candidate and the furthest developed.
AstraZeneca said on Tuesday it had paused trials, including late-stage ones, to allow an independent committee to review safety data, and it was working to minimise any potential impact on the timeline.
""It is obviously a challenge to this particular vaccine trial,"" Britain's Health Secretary Matt Hancock told Sky News.
The patient was suffering from neurological symptoms associated with a rare spinal inflammatory disorder called transverse myelitis, said Chief Executive Pascal Soriot, according to Stat News, citing investors who had listened to a call it said was organised by J.P. Morgan.
The diagnosis has yet to be confirmed, but the patient is recovering and will likely be discharged from the hospital soon, the CEO reportedly added. 
The pause follows reports that the United States was aiming for fast-track authorization or approval before November's presidential election.

The letter has sparked a furor after LVMH said on Wednesday it was walking away from the deal - which would have been the biggest of its kind in the luxury goods industry - citing the French request, saying it had made the transaction impossible. 
The letter, signed by Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian, urged LVMH to delay the closing of the acquisition from Nov. 24 until Jan. 6, 2021, given the threat of additional U.S. tariffs against French products.
LVMH's Financial Director Jean-Jacques Guiony told reporters that the group had been obliged to comply, and given it had no desire to extend negotiations, it could not complete the deal. 
The French government source said the letter had a ""political value"" and was meant to alert LVMH to the risks of pursuing the deal just as France wrangles with the United States over trade tariffs - but it was not binding. 
""They are free to take the letter into account or not,"" the source said, adding that the French government was not a stakeholder in the firm. 
According to a translated version of the letter released by Tiffany, Le Drian urged LVMH to take action at a time when the government was trying to dissuade U.S. authorities from slapping retaliatory tariffs on sectors like luxury goods from January. 
""In order to support the steps taken vis-a-vis the American government, you should defer the closing of the pending Tiffany transaction until January 6, 2021,"" the letter distributed by Tiffany read.
LVMH could not immediately be reached for comment. 

There would be no French government compensation for LVMH as a result of the Tiffany deal collapsing, the source said. Guiony earlier declined to comment on whether LVMH would seek compensation. He also shrugged off suggestions that LVMH had used the letter as a pretext to walk away from the deal.

Biden, who is launching a renewed focus on economic issues with a speech in Michigan on Wednesday, also will promise to reverse Trump administration policies that his campaign said amount to “loopholes” that allow offshoring to take place.
The former vice president will also pledge to take executive action during his first week in office to direct the federal government to buy American goods and support American supply chains in their procurement processes, his campaign said.
Biden’s proposals echo President Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign push to focus on reviving manufacturing in the U.S. and creating more U.S. jobs. Trump’s 2017 tax law was his signature legislative achievement. But the economic strength he planned to run on for re-election collapsed tn the spring when the coronavirus began to cause shutdowns across the country.
The policies are part of a broader economic push from Biden in a crucial battleground state as polls show voters about evenly split on which candidate, Biden or Trump, they trust more to manage the economy. Until recently, Trump had a reliable lead on only that issue. But the coronavirus pandemic brought job losses and manufacturing contraction that cut into that lead.
Biden’s proposal to target offshore profits adds to a previously announced plan to require corporations to pay a minimum 15% tax on their domestic profits. The combination would greatly inhibit companies’ ability to shift income and tax breaks between countries to avoid paying levies in the U.S. and abroad.
Biden will also say, according to his campaign, that Trump has broken his promises to bring jobs and profits back to the U.S.
“Offshoring, outsourcing, Buy American. These are areas where Donald Trump’s record has not been remotely matched by the reality,” senior policy adviser Jake Sullivan said in an interview ahead of the announcement.
Biden will propose a 28% corporate tax rate plus a 10% penalty surtax on the profits from any production by a U.S. company overseas for sale on American soil, making the overall tax rate on those profits 30.8%. The penalty will also apply to call centers and services that a U.S. company locates overseas but that serve the U.S.
He also plans to implement what his campaign described as “strong anti-inversion regulations and penalties,” though it did not detail those plans. He will also “deny all deductions and expensing writeoffs for moving jobs or production overseas” for jobs that could “plausibly” be done by American workers.
The surcharge is an attempt to “prevent firms from tax rate shopping,” said Carl Tannenbaum, chief economist at  Northern Trust  (NASDAQ:NTRS) and a former official at the Chicago Federal Reserve. “He’s trying to close the doors to multinationals that are flexible enough to move operations to other jurisdictions.”
Tannenbaum points out that these changes would require congressional action and its success would depend on Democrats winning a filibuster proof majority in the Senate in November.
Biden is also proposing a 10% “Made in America” tax credit for companies that create jobs for American workers and accelerate the U.S. economic recovery. It will be available for revitalizing closed or nearly closed facilities, retooling or expanding facilities, and bringing production or service jobs back to the U.S. and creating U.S. jobs. It will also apply when a company is increasing manufacturing wages above the pre-Covid baseline for jobs paying up to $100,000.
The Trump campaign has also proposed a “Made in America” tax credit in addition to tax credits for companies that bring back jobs from China, but he has provided no details on how that would work. Trump’s 2017 tax law included a tax deduction for corporations that manufacture in the U.S. and sell overseas, but the incentive has largely failed to spur new domestic production.
Biden’s plan would also end what his campaign describes as three “Trump offshoring loopholes” that were part of the 2017 tax law: allowing U.S. companies that locate production or call centers overseas to pay no taxes on the first 10% of profit, permitting companies to combine strategies to move profits overseas and park profits in tax havens to avoid paying all U.S. taxes, and applying taxes at just half the rate a U.S. company would pay for activities in the U.S.
Biden would double the Trump tax rate to a minimum tax of 21% on all foreign earnings of U.S. companies overseas. He would also end the use of tax haven strategies by applying the minimum tax to each foreign country separately.
Biden’s executive actions would use The Defense Production Act and the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 to enforce Buy American rules. Among other measures, he would also crack down on companies that label products as Made in America if they’re coming from China or elsewhere and create a Made in America office within the White House Office of Management and Budget to ensure that the government complies with Buy American rules.
Trump is holding an airport rally in Saginaw, Michigan on Thursday. Michigan is a must-win state for both candidates, after Trump won the state by 11,000 votes over Hillary Clinton in 2016.
Michigan’s unemployment rate was 8.7% in July, down more than 6 percentage points from the previous month, as it economy begins to reopen after strict virus lockdowns.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Amtrak Chief Executive William Flynn told Congress on Wednesday the U.S. passenger railroad needs up to $4.9 billion in government funding to avoid service and job cuts, and address mounting losses.
Flynn said the government-owned corporation anticipates needing that amount ""to operate and invest in our network, support our partners, and address various congressional concerns like avoiding employee furloughs and maintaining daily long distance service.""
Amtrak is burning $250 million a month and without additional government assistance would have to make ""very dramatic reductions across the company in order to stave off bankruptcy,"" Flynn told a U.S. House of Representatives subcommittee.
Amtrak in May had asked for a further $1.475 billion bailout after getting $1 billion from Congress in April. It typically receives $2 billion in annual government support.
Last week, Amtrak said it would furlough more than 2,000 workers, or about 10% of its staff, on Oct. 1 as a result of the steep decline in travel demand during the coronavirus pandemic - ridership and revenue levels are down 95% year-over-year.
Approximately 1,950 union members will be furloughed and 100 management jobs will be cut. Amtrak has said previously it employs about 20,000 workers.
Beginning in October, Amtrak is temporarily reducing service on most long distance routes from daily to three times per week after making earlier significant cuts to other service.
Transit agencies are urging Congress to approve up to %$36 billion on top of a $25 billion bailout it approved in March. Urban transit systems have been hurt by millions of workers staying home rather than commuting and a sharp decline in tourism.
Private U.S. bus companies are seeking $15 billion in government assistance.

U.S. airports want $10 billion in government assistance on top of an earlier $10 billion bailout, while passenger airlines want a further $25 billion in payroll assistance.

Investing.com --  Albertsons Companies  (NYSE:ACI) jumped 5% after announcing a Covid-19 test partnership.
Albertsons is working with Phosphorus, a genomics company, to begin offering at-home Covid-19 test kits in select market areas, with plans to expand the offering throughout September and October.
The supermarket giant's IPO priced at $16 in June, compared to about $13.79 today.
Results are back in 72 hours or less from the time the lab receives the test, which has Emergency Use Authorization by the Food and Drug Administration for the detection of Covid-19.
From their home, patients complete an online questionnaire that is reviewed by a local Albertsons pharmacist. The patient is then contacted by the pharmacy to schedule a pickup or delivery. The patient completes the saliva sample collection and sends it to the lab via the kit’s prepaid next-day shipping envelope. The results are delivered by email or text.
Currently, the pharmacy cannot bill insurance directly for the test; all payment is out-of-pocket.

The world's largest package delivery company plans to hire about the same number of seasonal holiday helpers as last year. It expects this year's peak season to extend from October to January - one month longer than last year, as retailers prep for their earliest-ever kickoff. 
 Target  (N:TGT),  Best Buy  (O:BBY) and Kohl's (N:KSS) have moved winter holiday promotions up to as early as October. They also joined rival Walmart (N:WMT) in announcing store closures on Thanksgiving and plans to bypass the midnight Black Friday door-buster sales that traditionally mark the start of the holiday shopping crush but now pose the risk of fueling COVID-19 infections. 
UPS, FedEx Corp (N:FDX), DHL (DE:DPWGn) and rising rival Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) since March have been inundated with demand for package deliveries as virus-wary shoppers shift purchases of everything from groceries to furniture online.
During the second quarter, average daily volume for the domestic package unit at UPS was 21.1 million, more than 91% of what it was during the fourth-quarter holiday peak. That volume was 17.2 million in the second quarter of 2019. 

The Atlanta-based company responded to the surge by hiring about 39,000 permanent U.S. workers in the latest quarter. It also is investing in automation.

Dunham, most recently the finance head of WeWork Americas, will assume office on Oct. 1, the company said.
Ross, who joined the firm in March as part of a broader top management overhaul being undertaken by Chairman Marcelo Claure, is stepping down owing to personal reasons, WeWork said.
Last month, WeWork said it had slashed its cash burn rate almost in half from the end of last year and obtained a $1.1 billion commitment in new financing from SoftBank.
The company shelved its initial public offering in 2019 after investors grew wary of its losses, business model and corporate governance, further leading to the resignation of co-founder and former chief executive officer Adam Neumann.

WeWork has since undergone an enormous management shake-up and remains enmeshed in lawsuits over a $3 billion tender offer to existing shareholders.

(Reuters) - Palantir Technologies Inc, the U.S. data analytics company known for its secretive work with the Central Intelligence Agency and other government groups, on Wednesday began efforts to woo Wall Street investors ahead of a public listing later this month. 
Palantir, co-founded in 2003 by billionaire Peter Thiel, is among 2020's most eagerly anticipated public listings, with much conjecture about how much the company is actually worth and whether investors will view it as a lucrative software provider or a less-glamorous consulting business. 
""Many of the world's most vital institutions, from defense and intelligence agencies to companies in the healthcare, energy, and manufacturing sectors, rely on the software platforms that we have built,"" Chief Executive Alex Karp said in a video message for a virtual investor day, echoing his remarks in Palantir's regulatory filing. 
The company said its shares will start trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Sept. 23. It said it had registered about 244.2 million shares for its debut, via a direct listing rather than a traditional initial public offering (IPO). 
""Historically, periods of macro instability or crisis have been a huge tailwind for us. The global financial crisis, ISIS attacks in Europe in 2015, and 2016, the present day COVID. And it's a tailwind for us because it means that the competitive alternative of building your own solution in three years or more, is just not viable,"" Chief Operating Officer Shyam Sankar said at the investor day.
Unlike an IPO, a direct listing does not raise fresh funds. Instead, existing investors can sell their shares.
Palantir has yet to turn a profit and the listing will test the appetite of investors who in recent years have grown more wary of backing loss-making startups, most notably WeWork, which botched its IPO last year.

Palantir will face scrutiny of its earning and business following years of being viewed as one of the most reclusive U.S. tech companies. It was valued at about $20 billion in its 2015 fundraising round. In the private market, its shares were trading earlier this year at a valuation of between $10 billion and $12 billion.

102,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 09, 2020 12:05PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Russian government tells state banks to ensure liquidity flow to Belarus lenders,"By Tatiana Voronova
MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia's prime minister and finance minister have told the country's biggest state lenders to ensure liquidity continues to flow to banks in Belarus, where a political crisis has increased strains on the financial sector, banking sources said. 
The top-level instructions are another sign of Moscow's support for embattled Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko, who has faced weeks of protests following a disputed Aug. 9 election. 
The unrest has triggered deposit outflows from Belarusian banks and a spike in foreign currency demand, pushing the local rouble to record lows  and eroding the central bank's already-sparse hard currency reserves. 
Two banking sources told Reuters that Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin and Finance Minister Anton Siluanov had asked senior executives at Sberbank (MM:SBER), VTB (MM:VTBR) and VEB, all with units in Belarus, to ensure the continued flow of Russian roubles to the neighbouring state. 
""Mishustin and Siluanov were calling the state banks asking (them) not to close (interbank) limits on Belarusian banks, so they could maintain access to rouble liquidity,"" the first source said. The second source confirmed the calls. 
The move also coincides with fears that Belarusian banks could be forced to curb operations should interbank lending stall. The sources said Russia's government is keen to avert a Ukraine-type scenario where Russian lenders were forced to take major write-offs on their Ukrainian units after 2017.
That happened after Kyiv slapped sanctions on several Russian state banks, following the Kremlin's 2014 annexation of Crimea and its alleged role in fomenting conflict in eastern Ukraine.
""There have been a lot of losses with Ukraine but Belarus is a different story,"" said a third source, a senior banker at a Russian state lender.
In Belarus, fears are high for Belgazprombank, a unit of Russia's Gazprombank , which has been placed under temporary administration by the central bank. Its head Viktor Babariko was jailed after trying to challenge President Alexander Lukashenko in the election. 
Lukashenko denies electoral fraud..
Russia's finance ministry and a spokesman for Mishustin did not reply to requests for comment. Sberbank declined to comment while VEB said it had not revised daily interbank funding lines for its unit in Belarus. 
VTB said it had not revised its funding lines with Belarus and its unit there.

RUSSIA TO THE RESCUE
Moscow's support will be crucial. Russian loans already account for 47% of external funding for Belarus, ratings agency Fitch estimates, with the rest sourced from Europe and China.
Fitch Ratings' senior director Olga Ignatieva estimates that Belarusian banks owe $2.0-$2.5 billion to their Russian counterparts through interbank loans. 
Fitch in a recent note predicted Belarusian banks would keep access to parent banks ""and, selectively, to Russian bank funding in the second part of 2020"". 
The Belarusian financial sector, comprising 24 banks, is nearly 80% state-controlled, with client funds accounting for the bulk of liquidity, central bank data shows. European and Kazakh banks are also present in Belarus in addition to Russian lenders and the state. 
Hard currency deposits comprise around 60% of bank accounts but as forex demand mounts, the central bank is limited in its ability to act as lender of last resort, the Institute for International Finance noted.

The Belarus central bank declined to comment.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) shares bounced on Wednesday, a day after the electric car maker suffered the biggest one-day percentage drop in the company's history. 
Shares jumped 6.88% a day after falling more than 21% as the company was passed over for inclusion in the benchmark S&P 500 (SPX) index. The decline on Tuesday chopped off about $80 billion in Tesla's market value, or more than the combined value of fellow automakers General Motors (N:GM) and Ford Motor (N:F). 
The stock has been on a meteoric climb this year, rising about 400% through Sept. 4, including a gain of more than 74% in August as expectations grew the company would be included in the S&P 500 after its second-quarter earnings cleared a hurdle for inclusion in the index. 
S&P late Friday announced it would include online craft seller  Etsy Inc  (O:ETSY), semiconductor equipment maker  Teradyne Inc  (O:TER) and pharmaceutical technology company  Catalent Inc  (N:CTLT) to the S&P 500 instead.

The capacity estimate assumes that an inoculation program would require only one dose, while multiple-course treatments would add to the demand, Glyn Hughes, the industry body’s head of cargo, said in a media briefing Wednesday.
“Airlift is the correct terminology here,” Hughes said. “We know the procedures well. What we need to do is scale them up to the magnitude that will be required.”
Some planes may not be suitable if the vaccines require the typical temperature range of 2-to-8 degrees Celsius for transporting drugs, he said. Frozen shipments would exclude even more aircraft.
IATA is working with airlines, airports, global health bodies and pharmaceutical firms to pull together plans for a distribution program, calling it the industry’s “largest single transport challenge ever.”
Fraport AG’s Frankfurt airport is assessing how it can help, while Air France-KLM is studying ways to maximize its network in Africa, Hughes said.
Flights to that continent as well as Latin America and parts of Southeast Asia, which lack vaccine-production capabilities, will be especially critical.
Developing markets rely almost wholly on cargo carried in the bellies of passenger planes, many of which remain grounded because of the fall-off in demand and travel restrictions put in place to stop the spread of the virus.
‘Military Precision’
Distributing a vaccine in Africa would be “impossible” right now, Hughes said, given the lack of capacity combined with the size of the region, thin surface-transport infrastructure and the complexities of border crossings.
Shipments will need to be planned with “almost military precision” and will require cool facilities at a network of staging posts where drugs can be stored between flights on the way to local dispersal.
There are as many as 250 different vaccine programs under development, Hughes said, citing the World Health Organization.
The U.S. and other governments have invested billions of dollars to develop a shot at an accelerated pace, and more than two dozen vaccines are now being tested in volunteers less than a year after the virus was first discovered. Eleven candidates are in late-stage trials.

The popular retailer of yoga pants and other athletic attire smashed through analyst expectations for its quarterly results, but a cautious tone by the head of the company during the earnings conference call this week prompted a sell-off in the shares, which tumbled 10% on Wednesday. 
""I'd like to reiterate that we are cautiously optimistic with regard to the holiday season,"" said Chief Executive Officer Calvin McDonald during the earnings call. ""Our starting point is that the environment remains uncertain. COVID is not yet contained in many of the markets where we operate, and while we expect the recovery to advance, we continue to plan for multiple scenarios this fall and particularly for the holiday season.""  
Lulu has navigated through tricky situations before. In 2013, the company was forced to recall pants for being made with see-through fabric. That was followed by founder Chip Wilson placing the blame for the transparent pants on women's bodies. Those comments helped lead to his departure from the company.
Lululemon reported earnings per share of 74 cents compared to the expected 54 cents on sales of $902.94 million, versus the estimated $842.31 million.

PARIS/NEW YORK (Reuters) - French luxury goods giant LVMH abandoned its $16 billion takeover of Tiffany, a deal that has lost its gloss in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, setting the stage for a bitter battle as the U.S. jeweler sued to force it through.
The French group, led by billionaire Bernard Arnault, said its board had received a letter from the French foreign ministry asking it to delay the acquisition to beyond Jan. 6, 2021, given the threat of additional U.S. tariffs against French products. 
LVMH (PA:LVMH) finance chief Jean Jacques Guiony said the letter was unsolicited and came as a total surprise, angrily rejecting suggestions that his company was using it as a pretext to pull out of the takeover of Tiffany (N:TIF).
""The deal cannot happen. We are prohibited from closing the deal,"" Guiony told reporters on a conference call. 
Nonetheless the terms of the deal, which would have been the biggest-ever in the luxury industry and was agreed before the pandemic, have also become less commercially attractive. 
The spread of COVID-19 has hammered sales in the sector hard and raised questions about whether Louis Vuitton owner LVMH was overpaying.
Guiony also said LVMH was not happy with the way Tiffany had been managed in recent months, calling its performance ""lackluster"". 
French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian will address in detail the issue of the planned takeover, a government spokesman said on Wednesday after a cabinet meeting. 
The French government could be neither ""passive"" nor ""naive"" in the context of international negotiations with its partners, spokesman Gabriel Attal told reporters.
LVMH added that Tiffany had also asked it to postpone the closing of the deal, to Dec. 31 of this year from an already extended deadline of Nov. 24. It said its board had decided to stick to the terms of the original merger agreement, which stated that the deal must be completed by Nov. 24 -- something that is no longer possible, Guiony said.
TIFFANY FILES LAWSUIT
Tiffany, however, filed a lawsuit against LVMH in Delaware - the U.S. state where the U.S. jeweler is registered - to force the French company to complete the deal as agreed last year, accusing it of deliberately stalling completion of the takeover.
It said in its lawsuit LVMH had made clear that its real goal was ""to attempt to renegotiate the merger price to which the parties agreed last November and, barring renegotiation, run out the clock.""
It also refuted LVMH's suggestion that it can pull out of the deal ""by claiming Tiffany has undergone a material adverse effect or breached its obligations under the Merger Agreement, or that the transaction is in some way inconsistent with its patriotic duties as a French corporation.""
Tiffany shares were down about 10.5% in New York, while LVMH shares in Paris were flat.
JEWELRY LOSES SHINE
The luxury industry is facing an unprecedented sales slump as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, after a decade of stellar growth, with revenues expected to fall by as much as 35% this year. It will take until 2022-23 for revenues to return to 2019 levels, according to consultancy Bain. 
The Tiffany deal had looked in doubt since it emerged in June that LVMH boss Arnault, France's richest person and a shrewd deal maker, was exploring ways to reopen price negotiations with the jeweler because of the pandemic, according to sources with knowledge of the matter.
Those sources said later that the group had decided against renegotiating the terms of the takeover, and LVMH has repeatedly said it was committed to the deal. Guiony said on Wednesday his group had never sought to obtain a better price.
But an initial Aug. 24 deadline was pushed back by three months as the deal had not yet been cleared by the EU Commission and other antitrust authorities. 
When it struck the deal, LVMH was betting it could restore the luster of Tiffany by investing in spruced-up stores and new collections. 
But the U.S. jeweler's worldwide sales fell 29% to $747.1 million in the three months to end July, missing expectations of $772 million, even though it flagged a recovery in August. LVMH's own watches and jewelry division was the worst-performing in the first half of the year. 

On Wednesday, Tiffany said it expected its earnings for the fourth quarter to exceed those for the same period last year.

Investing.com --  Slack's getting none as it failed to wow the market with quarterly results. 
Shares tumbled 15% on Wednesday, a day after reporting second quarter billings of $218 million that missed the average estimate of $232.9 million, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Slack Technologies Inc  (NYSE:WORK) also slumped 16% in aftermarket trading Tuesday following the earnings report.Canaccord Genuity, which has a buy rating on the stock, lowered its price target for Slack to $32 from $38 as analyst David Hynes said the ""good outweighs the bad, despite what the stock might tell you,"" according to Seeking Alpha.
The billings and net dollar retention disappointments in the most recent quarter were offset by new paid customer strength for the second consecutive quarter, Hynes said. The main question is whether the quarter's issues are ""cyclical, structural, or perhaps the result of competition.""
Piper Sandler (NYSE:PIPR), which also has a buy-equivalent rating on Slack, cited ""rising execution risk"" and expects a further softening of growth.
Wedbush, which has a sell-equivalent rating on the stock, remains on the sidelines as competition from Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) Teams looms, Seeking Alpha reported. 
Slack has five buy ratings, four holds and two sells, according to analysts tracked by Investing.com. 
Earnings per share of 0 cents beat the estimated loss per share of 3 cents, on sales of $215.86 million, which compares to the expected $209.08 million, according to analysts tracked by Investing.com.

112,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 09, 2020 10:10AM ET</span>",How drugmakers can keep their pledge and still deliver an October vaccine surprise,"By Michael Erman and Julie Steenhuysen
NEW YORK (Reuters) - As questions mount over whether the United States will authorize a coronavirus vaccine ahead of November elections, experts say there is a slim chance that enough evidence will be available to prove one is safe and effective in that time frame.
U.S. President Donald Trump has repeatedly said a vaccine is possible before the Nov. 3 election, and accused a “deep state” within the nation’s top health regulator of trying to slow pivotal clinical trials to hamper his chances at a second term. 
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration denied that claim, saying its decisions will be guided by data alone. Drugmakers, seeking to bolster public confidence amid political squabbles on Tuesday pledged to uphold scientific safety and efficacy standards in their quest for a vaccine. 
Vaccine safety was in focus on Wednesday after AstraZeneca (NYSE:AZN) PLC said that it had put a pause on its coronavirus trial on the vaccine with Oxford to review the safety data of an unexplained illness in the U.K. trial. It described the move as routine and said it would restart trials when an independent committee recommended it do so.
Other companies have recently made comments suggesting they could have an answer on whether their vaccines work before November.
""It would really be an amazing vaccine to show that,"" Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told Reuters. 
Fauci said initial trial results are likely to become available in November or December, but late October remains a possibility. ""It is conceivable that if there are enough infections documented early on that you might get that answer earlier,"" he said. 
Vaccines must demonstrate they are at least 50% more effective than a placebo to be considered for approval. To prove that, government officials have said, at least 150 COVID-19 infections must be recorded among trial participants with at least twice as many occurring among the placebo group.
If a vaccine is especially effective, companies could have their answer sooner.  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) and  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc, whose U.S. vaccine trials have enrolled thousands of people and are the most advanced, say they may have proof after just a few dozen subjects become infected.
Independent panels of experts called data and safety monitoring boards (DSMB) will review trial data at pre-specified points. These boards can recommend companies stop the trials if the evidence is overwhelmingly positive or negative.
For Pfizer, the first interim look occurs when 32 trial volunteers get infected. 
Experts interviewed by Reuters cautioned that information gleaned from a limited number of subjects could miss important safety issues that letting the trial fully play out might reveal.
    
'ABSOLUTELY INSUFFICIENT'
Pfizer's trial calls for four interim analyses by the DSMB, the first after just 32 recorded infections. ""We may have enough data to be able to share the first analysis by October,"" said Pfizer spokeswoman Jerica Pitts.
Moderna’s first interim analysis will come after 53 trial subjects become infected, the company told investors last month.
Basing a decision on 53 cases, is “an absolutely insufficient number,” said Dr. Gregory Poland, a vaccine researcher at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester who has served on FDA vaccine advisory panels. ""You would know very little about safety."" 
To halt the trials due to positive results, vaccines would likely have to exceed the 50% efficacy threshold.
Pfizer has not disclosed what standard will be used for stopping its trial early. William Gruber, head of vaccine clinical research and development for Pfizer, said ""the standard would be evidence of very high efficacy."" 
A senior official with the U.S. effort to accelerate COVID-19 vaccine development said companies have created appropriate trials to hold interim analyses that could detect especially effective vaccines earlier.
    
SPEEDY ENROLLMENT
Although both drugmakers began vaccinating people in their respective 30,000-subject trials on July 28, Pfizer is in position to generate results earlier in part because it is administering the second shot of its two-dose vaccine a week earlier than Moderna. Moderna also slowed enrollment to ensure greater participation of at-risk minorities in its study.
Pfizer's trial also begins collecting data on infections that occur a week after it administers its second shot. Moderna has a two-week lag between the second shot and when it will begin collecting infection data in earnest.
Both trials are on pace to be fully enrolled soon.
Dr. Henry Miller, a senior fellow at the Pacific Research Institute think tank and former director of the FDA's office of biotechnology, said an emergency use authorization based on a small number of infections would not deliver an adequate answer on the safety of a vaccine intended for use by millions of healthy people. Some side effects could take four to six months to occur, he said.
Dr. Gregory Glenn, research chief for  Novavax  (NASDAQ:NVAX) Inc, which is also developing a coronavirus vaccine, said the October timeline remains possible. But he believes Americans will likely be waiting longer. 

""I just think humility is a good thing right now,"" he said. ""The FDA set out some pretty strict criteria for success. So that's going to take a pretty good vaccine to do that.""

Investing.com --  Airlines fell on Wednesday as travelers fail to return to the skies.
United Airlines Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:UAL), American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) and Delta Air Lines Inc (NYSE:DAL) all dropped almost 3%.
United Airlines forecast a bigger drop in third-quarter passenger revenue than it had previously expected, and said it would look to cancel more flights until it sees a recovery in air travel, Reuters reported. 
United expects an 85% drop in passenger revenue, down from its previous estimate of a drop of 83% year-over-year. Third-quarter capacity will also drop about 70% year-over-year, compared with its prior forecast for a decline of 65%. The airline has seen a moderate improvement in bookings for leisure travel in the U.S. and certain short-haul destinations in Latin America and the Caribbean, Reuters said.
Meanwhile, Delta expects a choppy recovery, despite some bright spots, Seeking Alpha reported. Executives at the Cowen Global Transportation and Sustainable Mobility Conference said Delta is on track to reach its third quarter expense reduction target of 50%, with a daily cash burn rate of about $27 million.   
U.S. airlines have been bleeding about $5 billion a month, Reuters reported.  "

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened higher on Wednesday, led by a bounce in tech stocks after their worst one-day sell-off since the early days of the pandemic. 
By 10:15 AM ET (1415 GMT), the Nasdaq Composite was up 203 points, or 1.9%, recovering a little less than half of Tuesday's losses.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 459 points, or 1.7% and the S&P 500 was up 1.8%. 
There were solid, but still limited, rebounds for Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock, the two highest-profile losers of recent days. Tesla bounced 6.8% after losing 21% on Tuesday, while Apple - which has countersued Fortnite publisher Epic Games in their dispute over commissions - regained 3.4% after losing some 8%.
Others to rebound sharply included Zoom Video (NASDAQ:ZM) stock, which rose 3.8%, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), which gained 3.3% and chipmaker Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock, which rose 3.7%.
Sentiment was helped by the release of the Bureau of Labor Stastistics' JOLTS job openings survey, which showed another sharp rise in the number of vacancies to 6.618 million from 6 million last month. That's the highest reading since May, and it may further ease the pressure on quarrelling U.S. politicians to strike a deal over another package of stimulus measures. 
Senate Republicans on Tuesday proposed a package of measures with a sticker price of $650 billion, of which nearly half would be financed with unused funds left over from previous stimulus packages. House Democrats again rejected the measure as inadequate, although Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said he still though there was a good chance of the two striking a compromise deal.
Even so, there were some big losers, including Tiffany (NYSE:TIF) stock, which fell 10.5% after French luxury giant LVMH (OTC:LVMUY) dropped its proposed $16.2 billion bid for the company. Investors appeared to attribute little chance of success to the jeweller's suit that seeks to force LVMH to go through with the deal.  LVMH's move leaves Tiffany exposed to the risks of in a market where tourist spending and footfall at physical boutiques are all-important.
Other stocks in the red included Slack Technologies (NYSE:WORK) stock, which fell 14.4% after the messaging app company failed to live up to stretched expectations with its quarterly report after the close on Tuesday.  Lululemon Athletica  (NASDAQ:LULU) also fell after it declined to give guidance for the rest of the year on Tuesday - despite beating analysts' forecasts for the latest quarter."

A court in Braunschweig, Germany, near where Volkswagen is headquartered, expanded the list of charges beyond fraud to include organized commercial fraud, preliminary remarks published by the court at the start of the trial showed.
Winterkorn and other Volkswagen executives face charges for their role in allowing diesel cars with illegal emissions-masking software to hit the road. 
Because Volkswagen vehicles had higher pollution levels than was declared, they should have been subject to higher road tax, and former Volkswagen executives should therefore also face charges of tax evasion and false advertising, the court added.
The scandal, which was uncovered by U.S. authorities in September 2015, has cost Volkswagen more than 30 billion euros ($35 billion) in refits, legal fees and settlements, and resulted in a drastic management and strategy overhaul.
A lawyer for Winterkorn said his client denied the charges. The accusations against Winterkorn are limited in scope and relate to a specific instance in time, the lawyer added.
Volkswagen said that while it was no longer the target of prosecutors after settling charges, it wanted to emphasize that all of the accused were innocent until proven guilty. 
Volkswagen also said it had taken extensive measures to change processes, systems and controls to improve compliance in the wake of the emissions scandal.

LONDON (Reuters) - A project involving 13 of the world's largest banks and aimed at launching digital versions of major currencies in 2020 is no longer likely to get going this year, the company set up to run the effort said.
Technological development work on the previously named ""Utility Settlement Coin"" initiative has progressed, but it still needs regulatory approval, said Fnality International Chief Executive Rhomaios Ram. It hopes to receive that approval by the first quarter of 2021, he said.
Initially spearheaded by UBS Group AG (S:UBSG), the project has been in the works for more than five years and seeks to create a more efficient way for banks to settle financial transactions.
In June 2019 banks including  Barclays  Plc (L:BARC),  Banco Santander  (MC:SAN) and  Credit Suisse  Group AG (S:CSGN) announced the creation of Fnality, investing £50 million into the venture. The company had said it expected the project to be commercialized by 2020.
The banks declined to comment.
The project is looking to replace some of the cumbersome processes and paperwork involved in transferring value between financial organizations by using digital versions of the dollar, yen, euro, sterling and the Canadian dollar.
The venture is one of several high profile efforts by banks and other large financial companies to use blockchain, the technology underpinning cryptocurrencies, to streamline operations and lower costs.
While the sector has spent millions of dollars on experiments and tests, only a few projects have had a significant impact and many are taking longer than expected.
In many cases the technology has been built but projects have been delayed because of regulatory or operational hurdles. In other instances projects have failed or have been abandoned because they did not get widely adopted after being launched.
""The technology is the least complicated part of this whole thing,"" said Ram.
Other companies have been seeking to launch blockchain-based systems to carry out payments.
In June 2019,  Facebook Inc  (O:FB) announced it was leading the creation of a digital currency called Libra. The project has faced significant regulatory pushback globally and has since been delayed and reshaped.
Last week, Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey said that if so-called stablecoins are to be used widely there must be equivalent regulatory standards to those in place for existing forms of payment.

“I’ve got skeptics against me out there right now that there’s going to be a shoe to drop in our commercial bank because of loan impairments that will be higher in a Covid recession than they might be in other recessions,” Chief Executive Officer Darryl White told Bloomberg in an interview. “I’m happy to take them on because I predict that we will continue in this environment to have lower loan losses than our peers.”
Bank of Montreal’s emphasis on commercial lending has helped the Toronto-based firm increase earnings in recent years while expanding in the U.S., where the company owns Chicago-based BMO Harris Bank and has an investment-banking presence. About 57% of its loans were to businesses and governments in the fiscal third quarter, higher than the 41% average for Canada’s six biggest lenders, according to the banks’ financial disclosures.
Yet with this year’s virus-fueled recession and a poor showing in the U.S. Federal Reserve’s annual stress test, some have questioned whether the bank is too exposed to business lending. Among Canada’s six large banks, only Bank of Nova Scotia’s share price has performed worse this year.
The Fed’s stress test results released in June concluded that in a “severely adverse scenario” the capital strength of Bank of Montreal’s U.S. holding company would be the lowest of 33 banks reviewed -- a finding the bank disputes.
“There’s a little bit of myth-busting that I think we need to do to get people enlightened on what our North American commercial business is and how powerful it is -- and how completely integrated it is with our Canadian business,” White, 49, said. “This is a leadership business that will be with us for a very long time.”
Bank of Montreal’s underwriting practices haven’t changed and its bankers have been able to select business clients they think can weather the downturn, White said, adding that he sees nothing in the current environment to suggest they’re going to face outsized losses. He aims to prove the naysayers wrong at a Sept. 30 investor event.
White became CEO of Canada’s fourth-largest lender by assets in November 2017. Within his first year he set a goal to increase earnings from the U.S. to a third of overall profit, up from about 24% before he took over. The U.S. share of profit reached 34% in fiscal 2019 and was at 32% in the first nine months of fiscal 2020, according to company disclosures.
A U.S. earnings contribution between 33% and 35% is “comfortable,” White said, adding that he doesn’t see a need to deviate from that range.
“Relative to what I see today in terms of economic activity in Canada and the U.S., I think it’s a great number for us as a bank,” White said. “More of the same would be fantastic, but we’ll do it with the discipline on efficiency.”
White also reiterated his interest in improving productivity at what has been Canada’s least efficient bank, though he said his goal will be harder to reach because of the business impact from Covid-19. The bank has a target of improving its efficiency ratio -- a measure of what it costs to produce a dollar of revenue -- to 58% or better on an adjusted basis by the end of fiscal 2021. The measure has fallen to 60.2% for the year to date, an improvement from the 61.9% level at the end of his first year.
“At this point, we’re not waving the flag and we’re going to stay committed to the objective,” White said. “It’ll be harder to get to, for sure, but we’re still on it.”
Diversity Targets
Separately, the bank set new diversity targets for the next five years, which include:

DUBLIN/PARIS (Reuters) - Ryanair (I:RYA) slashed its annual passenger target by another 10 million on Wednesday, becoming the latest European airline to signal more capacity cuts as resurgent COVID-19 infections and travel restrictions dent recovery hopes.
""The winter of 2020 will be a write-off,"" Ryanair Group Chief Executive Michael O'Leary predicted in an interview. Europe's biggest low-cost carrier is preparing to close some bases and shrink others, he told Reuters.
Airlines have blamed an uneven patchwork of travel restrictions and quarantine rules across Europe for a stop-go recovery that has proven tougher than many expected.
Ryanair's low-cost rival easyJet (L:EZJ), already cutting 4,500 jobs and closing three UK bases, further reduced its flying schedule for the current quarter on Tuesday.
And Wizz Air (L:WIZZ), which had touted an aggressive push for market share and even a new London Gatwick base, last week scaled down operations for the current quarter to 60% of capacity from the previously expected 80%.
Overall, September short-haul schedules have been cut to 43% of European capacity from 47.6% in August,  Barclays  (LON:BARC) analyst Rishika Savjani said - and that only tells part of the story.
""We think demand is tracking below these levels, and therefore we'd expect weaker load factors and weaker pricing for the quarter,"" Savjani said in a Tuesday note, referring to a key metric for the proportion of aircraft seats filled.
""Pricing is going to be aggressively down"" in coming months, the Ryanair boss said. O'Leary was among the first CEOs to warn of a virus-induced price war in comments since borne out by a recovering Chinese market, where some carriers now offer all-you-can-fly deals.
Ryanair now expects to fly 50 million passengers in the fiscal year to March, one-third of the previous year's number. The goal was previously cut to 60 million in July from 80 million in May and could go lower still, O'Leary cautioned.
""We're probably looking at closing more bases and withdrawing more capacity in those countries where you're operating completely defective and non-scientific quarantines,"" he added - citing Britain, Ireland, Spain and Portugal. 
Fourteen-day Western European infection rates that have risen to 64.9 per 100,000 from 19.4 in late July are ""not reflected in share prices"", with airline stocks up 14% over the period, Goodbody analyst Mark Simpson warned.
Behind the cutback announcements, Ryanair and Wizz remain relatively well positioned over traditional airlines with more ""exposure to high-risk long-haul markets"", Simpson said.
Further setbacks may leave legacy carriers like Air France-KLM (PA:AIR) and Lufthansa (DE:LHAG) in need of yet more funding on top of their multibillion-euro state-backed bailouts, other analysts warn. Air France needs a strong recovery to avoid the looming prospect of nationalisation.
O'Leary, who last week bolstered Ryanair's already strong balance sheet with a 400 million-euro share issue, remains confident the Irish no-frills carrier can come out on top.

""Our rivals have withdrawn huge amounts of capacity,"" he said. ""The competitive landscape if anything is getting easier.""

PARIS (Reuters) -  Renault  (PA:RENA) might have to cut more costs than the 2 billion euros ($2.4 billion) in savings already planned to get back on its feet, the French carmaker's new Chief Executive Luca de Meo said in an internal memo seen by Reuters.
""The aim is to get back on the right track and to resolve our most pressing problems as quickly as possible: treasury and costs. This means we will perhaps need to go further than planned with our cost-cutting efforts,"" he said in the memo. 
De Meo, a former Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) executive who took over as CEO in July, did not give a figure for how much more money the company needed to save. 
Asked to comment on the memo, a Renault spokesman said De Meo was working on a plan to transform the company by focusing more on profitability than sales volumes.
Renault acknowledged in May that its global ambitions had been unrealistic and announced plans to cut about 15,000 jobs, shrink production and restructure French plants in a bid to slash 2 billion euros from its costs.
De Meo said in the memo that Renault should model itself on the turnaround path followed by rival PSA (PA:PEUP), the maker of  Peugeot  (OTC:PUGOY) cars, which has focused on trimming costs and producing more profitable vehicle ranges in recent years.
""We will need to take decisions that are sometimes difficult, but are necessary and positive for the company. I would describe it as a revolution,"" he wrote in the memo.
""This revolution, which must be pushed forward by all the men and women of the company, I'm calling it a 'Renaulution'.""

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are set to open higher Wednesday, with the dominant tech sector rebounding after its hefty selloff, while lawmakers prepare for a vote to potentially advance a stimulus bill.  
At 7 AM ET (1100 GMT), S&P 500 Futures traded 20 points, or 0.6%, higher, the Dow Futures contract rose 100 points, or 0.4%, while Nasdaq 100 Futures climbed 160 points, or 1.4%. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 2.3%, or 632 points Tuesday. The S&P 500 was down 2.8%, while the Nasdaq Composite slumped 4.1% into correction territory, with losses of about 10% in the past three days.
""This has been a correction that was probably not that surprising, given the move in August in the tech sector,"" said Salman Baig, an investment manager at Unigestion in a Reuters report, but he sees the outlook for Big Tech as positive.
""It's exactly those companies that are [the] new economy - they are benefiting because of their model, the industry, the virus.""
Regarding the coronavirus,AstraZeneca (NYSE:AZN) ADRs fell 2.2% after the Anglo-Swedish pharma company paused a late-stage trial of its Covid-19 vaccine candidate due to an unexplained illness in a study participant. The AstraZeneca vaccine is one of three coronavirus vaccines in late-stage, Phase 3 trials in the U.S.
Elsewhere, Tiffany  (NYSE:TIF) stock fell 8.5% in premarket as French luxury giant LVMH (OTC:LVMUY) withdrew its takeover offer for the jeweller.
In Washington, Republican Senate leaders look to hold a vote later this week on a slimmed-down stimulus bill. This bill is much smaller than the $2.2 trillion package that House Democrats are seeking, but time is becoming very limited ahead of the presidential election.
“September is likely to be the last opportunity to pass fiscal measures until well after the election and potentially early 2021,” analysts at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) wrote in a note to clients on Tuesday. “Incumbents of both parties might be wary of inaction for such a long period.”
The Bureau of Labor Statistics will release its latest JOLTS job opening data at 10 AM ET (1400 GMT). Analysts tracked by Investing.com expect to see 6 million, which would be more than the 5.889 million reported for the previous month. 
Crude prices bounced Wednesday, recovering some of the previous session’s sharp selloff which saw the international benchmark Brent contract trade below $40 a barrel for the first time since late June.
The oil market will have a lot to digest during the session, with the OPEC monthly report and the Energy Information Administration's Short-Term Energy Outlook due for release later Wednesday. 
Additionally, the weekly API report is likely to show another draw in crude stockpiles for the week ended Sept. 6.
U.S. crude futures traded 1.2% higher at $37.20 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract rose 0.6% to $40.03.
Elsewhere, gold futures fell 0.7% to $1,929.95/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% lower at 1.1766.

128,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 09, 2020 07:10AM ET</span>",Blackstone's Schwarzman emerges as Wall Street's top political donor,"By Chibuike Oguh
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Blackstone Group Inc (N:BX) Chief Executive Stephen Schwarzman has spent more than $27 million so far this year backing U.S. politicians, including President Donald Trump, making him Wall Street's largest campaign contributor, according to a Reuters review of regulatory filings.
Schwarzman, whose net worth is pegged by Forbes at $18.2 billion, has given more to political campaigns this year than those who outspent him on Wall Street in the previous U.S. presidential election cycle of 2016, including Bloomberg LP founder Michael Bloomberg and hedge fund veterans George Soros, Paul Singer and Robert Mercer, the filings from the Center of Responsive Politics and the Campaign Finance Institute show.
With less than two months left till the Nov. 3 election, Schwarzman, a lifelong Republican, has more than doubled his political donations compared to the 2018 midterm election, and raised them more than fivefold since 2016, the filings show. 
Blackstone declined to comment on what has been driving the increase in Schwarzman's political donations and did not make him available for an interview. The jump in his election spending comes as Trump trails his Democratic challenger Joe Biden in opinion polls, and as his Republican party fights to keep control of the Senate, defending more seats than it is challenging.
""Schwarzman, like many Republican donors, believes this will be a close election,"" said Paul Herrnson, a political science professor at the University of Connecticut and research fellow at the Center for Responsive Politics. 
Trump's campaign did not respond to a request for comment.
""President Trump enjoys support from a vast number of industries, but most importantly, from real voters across the country,"" a Republican National Committee spokeswoman said in a statement. 
Schwarzman, whose firm is one of the world's largest real estate investors, got to know Trump in New York social circles when the latter was a property developer. He backed Trump's bid for president in 2016, and chaired the White House's strategic and policy forum, an advisory council comprising business leaders that was disbanded after Trump stirred controversy with comments on a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia in 2017.
Schwarzman, 73, remains an unofficial adviser to Trump, and earlier this year he was named as a member of the 'Great American Economic Revival Industry Groups', which the White House formed as part of its policy response to the coronavirus outbreak.
With $564 billion in assets, Blackstone is the world's largest manager of alternative investments, such as private equity, real estate, corporate credit and hedge funds. While the rise in its shares during Trump's tenure - a 70% increase since he took office - is in line with the rally in its stock during President Barack Obama's second term, Schwarzman has been an ardent supporter of Trump and Republican causes, and a critic of Obama's administration.
In 2010, Schwarzman compared Obama's unsuccessful proposal to raise the tax rate on carried interest received by private equity fund managers to Adolf Hitler's invasion of Poland in 1939, subsequently apologizing for the analogy. When Trump lowered corporate and some individual tax rates in 2017, Schwarzman called the move a ""game changer"".
Yet Schwarzman's support of Trump has not been without compromise. He has been a high-profile advocate of closer U.S.-China ties, sponsoring a $575 million international scholarship program in partnership with Tsinghua University in Beijing, even as Trump pushes for ""decoupling"" from China following rows over trade, cybersecurity and the spread of the coronavirus.
PAC DONATIONS
In March, Schwarzman donated $3 million to America First Action Inc, an independent political action committee known as a super PAC, that is closely aligned to Trump.
Schwarzman's largest donations, however, have gone to the Senate Leadership Fund and the Congressional Leadership Fund, the two Republican super PACs whose main goal is to maintain or secure the party's majority in both houses of Congress, according to the funds' websites. 
As of the end of July, Schwarzman had donated $20 million and $2.5 million to the Senate and Congressional Leadership Funds, respectively.
Other senior Blackstone executives are prominent Democratic donors. Schwarzman's No. 2, Blackstone President Jonathan Gray, has spent more than $1.3 million backing Democratic politicians in this election cycle, including Biden. 

This is in line with his predecessor Tony James, who is also a major backer of Democrats and now serves as Blackstone's executive vice chairman.

The company is also considering launching products under the so-called Qualified Domestic Limited Partnership (QDLP), an outbound investment scheme, to help mainland Chinese invest offshore, said the people with direct knowledge of the plans.
China fully opened its fast-growing mutual fund sector to foreign companies by removing ownership restrictions on April 1 as part of an interim trade deal with the United States signed in January.
BlackRock (N:BLK), Neuberger Berman and Fidelity International have applied to set up fully-owned mutual fund subsidiaries in China, while Vanguard Group and  Schroders  (LON:SDR) will follow suit.
VanEck, whose strategies include emerging market equity and fixed income, gold and exchange-traded funds (ETFs), started planning for China entry late last year, when Beijing vowed to fully open its financial sector in 2020, a source said.
The coronavirus outbreak slowed VanEck's China strategy, but in recent months the company had been in active contact with Chinese regulators. It hasn't yet submitted an application though, the sources said.
Representatives at VanEck's Shanghai unit declined to comment. The sources declined to be named as the company's plans are not public yet.
VanEck, which runs both actively- and passively-managed funds, has not finalized its China product strategy yet, and its mutual fund plans are also subject to change, the sources said.
Separately, VanEck, whose founder John van Eck was a well-known pioneer in gold investments, is also exploring businesses under China's QDLP scheme, the sources said, tapping into Chinese investors' penchant for gold.

130,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 09, 2020 06:36AM ET</span>",Pandemic e-commerce surge spurs race for 'Tesla-like' electric delivery vans,"By Nick Carey
(Reuters) - Delivery fleet operators face regulatory pressure in California and other states to buy electric vehicles, but a surge in package deliveries thanks to coronavirus lockdowns has major firms itching to switch to electric right now.
And they want far more than just battery-powered versions of diesel- or gas-guzzling trucks and vans. 
Fleet operators such as  United Parcel  Service Inc (N:UPS) hunger for computers on wheels that can harvest data and upgrade safety or autonomous features overnight to save money and boost profit.
""For us, it's not just about making the wheels turn with a zero-emission vehicle,"" said Scott Phillippi, UPS's senior director of fleet maintenance and engineering, who envisions ""Tesla-like"" vehicles in the company's vast fleet. ""It's about an integrated-technology vehicle - and that's really what we're pushing for.""
With its ability to send wireless upgrades and fixes to customers' electric cars, Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) is seen as a bellwether for electrification. Major companies like UPS want to harness that power to bring cost-saving, autonomous or safety measures to their fleets in real time.
If, for instance, a manufacturer developed a feature to prevent a truck from bumping into a loading dock, UPS could have it in tens of thousands of vehicles overnight to prevent expensive dents, Phillippi said.
UPS, Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN), and other e-commerce delivery companies are both creating and shaping the emerging market for electric vans and trucks. Economics and competitive advantages created by data will drive the market for electric commercial vehicles.
Demand for electric commercial vehicles is accelerating in part because battery range, long a concern for fleets, has improved dramatically, while battery costs have fallen. 
UPS has ordered 10,000 vans from UK startup Arrival Ltd - the majority for the U.S. market - in which UPS also owns a minority stake. Arrival is working on self-driving technology, which is one reason why UPS is supporting the company, UPS's Phillippi said.
The company has also reserved 125 of Tesla's long-awaited Semi big rigs, 50 electric trucks from Workhorse Group Inc (O:WKHS) - with an option for 950 more - and is testing electric trucks with California startup Xos.
Tesla's Semi was due to go into production in 2019, but is now slated for 2021. Tesla did not respond to requests for comment. 
Amazon ordered 100,000 electric vans last year from startup Rivian Automotive LLC - in which it has invested - and ordered 1,800 more from  Daimler  AG's (DE:DAIGn) Mercedes-Benz car and vans division for its European fleet last month.
While demand is soaring, supply is still virtually non-existent and production has been beset by delays.
""Ultimately, there's no trucks available yet,"" Phillippi said. ""We're just waiting for vehicles to show up.""
The pressure is rising for manufacturers to deliver. Startups such as Rivian and Arrival are racing with larger, established vehicle makers including Daimler (OTC:DDAIF),  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) and General Motors Co (N:GM) to get electric trucks into production.
Startup Xos Trucks, for example, has begun low-volume production of vans with Mexican auto supplier Metalsa [MSDC.UL], a part-owner and strategic partner, using a ""modular"" battery approach where battery packs are added based on a customer's range needs. 
Xos Trucks Chief Executive Dakota Semler recounts the recent reaction of a customer when told their vehicles would be delivered in 2021. 
""They said, 'What do I have to do get it by the end of this year?'"" Semler said.
'ACTIVELY RAISING CAPITAL'
The years-long journey of one electric delivery vehicle startup, California-based Chanje Energy Inc, shows the challenges vehicle makers and their customers face creating a new industry on the fly. 
California's decision in June to require commercial truck manufacturers to sell a rising number of zero-emission vehicles, starting in 2024, drew attention to the market. 
But Bryan Hansel, Chanje's CEO, said California's mandate made little difference. The surge in e-commerce delivery caused by the coronavirus pandemic had already caused fleet operators to zero in on the 50 miles per gallon (80 km per gallon) equivalent his vans offer versus the 6 to 8 mpg averaged by conventional diesel trucks.
Back in 2018, package delivery company FedEx Corp (N:FDX) ordered 1,000 Chanje vans. But Chanje had to pause while its battery supplier, China's Contemporary Amperex Technology (CATL) (SZ:300750), updated its batteries' energy density. 
That boosted the range of Chanje's vehicles to 150 miles from 100 miles. Its 2021 model should have a range of 200 miles, Hansel said, making it capable of handling 90% of U.S. last-mile delivery routes - the ""last-mile"" of e-commerce where drivers drop off packages at individual consumers' doors is typically the most expensive.
Chanje had to tackle other problems. 
Like other fleet operators, FedEx is not a fueling company - conventional fleets send vehicles to gas stations to fill up - so it lacked chargers for a large fleet. So Chanje became an energy services company, building out overhead charging stations at 20 FedEx depots across California to charge all 1,000 vans it will deliver in the first half of 2021.
Chanje also has stepped up its software and electronics capability. After drivers reported the vehicles would roll backward if they took their foot off the accelerator on a hill, Chanje spent four weeks rewriting the code with a software fix. Then, according to Hansel, the company ""just flashed it over the wire to every truck we've ever built."" 
Chanje's vans are assembled in China by FDG Electric Vehicles Ltd (HK:0729), currently its main investor. 
""But we are actively in the market raising capital because the capital markets seem to be very interested in the EV space right now,"" Hansel said.

In addition, outstanding bonds would be converted into securities that would not mature until 2026 in a move that will significantly reduce the company's high level of indebtedness, Selecta said (https://www.selecta.com/dam/jcr:a36ed61a-eb03-49b8-862a-3f38075d0dae/Selecta%20Group%20-%20Lock-Up%20Agreement%20Press%20Release.pdf) in a statement released late on Tuesday.
Major shareholder KKR, creditor banks and a substantial portion of the bondholders had agreed to the recapitalisation.
""These actions ensure we are now on a very stable footing and allow us to deliver on our strategic business plan as we traverse the post-COVID-19 operating landscape,"" Chairman Joe Plumeri said in the statement. 
Selecta, with more than 10,000 employees, has been badly hit by the coronavirus crisis in the past six months. Its vending machines offer chocolate bars, cold drinks, snacks and coffee in offices, train stations and other public places throughout Europe. 
Because many people stayed at home during the lockdown, the company's sales collapsed. 
Reuters had reported in May that Selecta was heading for a debt restructuring.

TOKYO (Reuters) - SoftBank Group Corp (T:9984) shares closed down almost 3% on Wednesday, extending this week's slump that has wiped around $13 billion from its market capitalisation, as investors fretted about the conglomerate's exposure to sliding U.S. tech stocks. 
The fall takes SoftBank's share decline to 10% since sources told Reuters and other media late last week that the Japanese company made big bets on equity derivatives tied to tech firms.
Chief Executive Masayoshi Son said last month SoftBank would place cash from an asset sale programme in public stocks but the complex transactions have caused jitters among retail investors in a company already widely viewed as opaque, analysts said.
The group ""needs to protect Masa's reputation by making sure it is not seen as a short-term trading giant, which would warrant a much bigger discount,"" Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) analyst Atul Goyal wrote in a note, referring to its market capitalisation being lower than the value of its assets.
SoftBank embarked on a share-buyback plan in March after the discount yawned to record levels, spending 1 trillion yen ($9.4 billion) through August before pointing to a slowdown in the pace of purchases.
The tech stock sell-off risks the share price gains, with SoftBank's trades striking some investors as going well beyond aims and methods of the public stock investment plan as previously outlined by Son. 
SoftBank, which has a history of making opaque trades through derivatives, has not commented publicly on the matter.
The group's purchase of call options in addition to share buying, which gives access to a much higher amount of shares on paper, is seen by analysts as having exacerbated the U.S. stock market's run-up and subsequent tech sell-off.
""The idea that tech is in a bubble is gaining traction,"" said analyst Kirk Boodry at Redex Research. Given the lack of clarity from the group, selling pressure is likely to continue while U.S. tech stocks are falling, Boodry said.
The change in strategy comes as SoftBank builds up ready cash by slashing exposure to stable assets such as Japanese wireless carrier SoftBank Corp (T:9434), which offers high dividends.
Son frequently emphasises in presentations the clear market value of his listed assets and how the group's $100 billion Vision Fund offers exposure to a basket of high-growth, unlisted startups.
However the shifting risk profile has caused nervousness, making SoftBank ""uninvestable for some investors,"" Boodry said.

133,By Investing.com,"<span>Sep 09, 2020 05:20AM ET</span>",StockBeat: Bargain-Hunting Without Exuberance as Defensives Lead,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- The rout in tech stocks in the U.S. over the last day has been a stiff test of nerve for European markets – but one to which they appear to be equal, at least for now.
Having fallen in knee-jerk fashion in line with the Nasdaq and the other big U.S. boards on Tuesday, European markets were all firmly back in the green as of 5:15 AM ET (0915 GMT) on Wednesday, helped by a smart bounce in Nasdaq futures as early birds in the U.S. logged on.
Even so, there was a heavy preference for defensive names such as telecoms, health and consumer staples. 
Among the notable outperformers were Orange (PA:ORAN) and Deutsche Telekom (DE:DTEGn) stock, up 3.6% and 2.3%, respectively, while  Reckitt Benckiser  (LON:RB) was up 2.3%, Unilever (NYSE:UL) stock was up 1.5% and Nestle (SIX:NESN) stock up 1.2%.
The ‘new defensives’ – especially renewable energy stocks backed by a wall of ESG-focused money – were also well bid, with  EDP Renovaveis  (LS:EDPR) stock up 2.8% and wind turbine makers  Vestas Wind  Systems (CSE:VWS) and Siemens  Gamesa  (MC:SGREN) both up more than 2%.
By contrast, the more volatile cyclical stocks were subdued, as a German auto summit ended without any concrete offer of fresh government support, and banks consolidated after the M&A excitement in Spain (Caixabank (MC:CABK) still gained 1.2% on reports that it’s looking to improve the terms of its mooted tie-up with  Bankia  (MC:BKIA)). Aerospace names continued to underperform after fresh reports of production trouble at Boeing (NYSE:BA), one of their biggest customers.  Meggitt  (LON:MGGT), Senior (LON:SNR) and Rolls Royce (LON:RR) all fell by 4% or more.
The benchmark Stoxx 600 was up 0.7%, still stuck in the narrow range it’s been in since June. For most of the last three months, that’s been a source of frustration for many, who have been forced to watch U.S. stocks disappear over the horizon. However, given events stateside over the last three days, European investors will settle for range trading quite happily, thank you very much.
Despite a valuation gap to the U.S. that is still miles wide, the appetite to push European stocks higher is limited. Coronavirus case numbers are surging in Spain, France and the U.K., and rising less dramatically elsewhere. Even though hospitalizations and death rates still remain well below the levels of spring, the fear of starting the flu season with a high level of community spread is evident.
What’s also increasingly evident is that investors have woken up to the risks of the latest Brexit drama, with sterling sliding and U.K. stocks clearly underperforming – the domestic-focused FTSE 250 was the only major index in the red on Wednesday morning.
However, even here, it’s the government’s erratic policy on lockdowns that appears to be the more important factor. Some of the biggest losers on Tuesday were WH Smith (LON:SMWH), sandwich bar operator SSP Group (LON:SSPG) and Trainline (LON:TRNT), all of them heavily exposed to mobility levels.  They fell by more than AstraZeneca (NYSE:AZN), despite the amount that’s been bet on it winning the race for a successful Covid-19 vaccine.
With the U.S. markets in flux and a European Central Bank meeting in 24 hours, it isn’t surprising that Europeans are happy to sit on their hands. But a pattern of defensive outperformance is quietly asserting itself nonetheless."

It has renegotiated financing terms for 56 of the 85 737s it held before it entered voluntary administration in April, a Virgin spokeswoman said, with the others to exit its fleet.
""Once demand returns, it remains our goal to grow our fleet to 75 Boeing 737 aircraft,"" the spokeswoman said.
Creditors last week voted in favour of the purchase by U.S. private equity group Bain, paving the way for a strategic overhaul of Australia's second-biggest airline.
Under Bain's business plan, Virgin plans to cut a third of its workforce and ditch its widebody planes to focus on being a domestic and short-haul international 737 operator competing against Qantas Airways Ltd (AX:QAN).
Virgin Chief Executive Paul Scurrah said last week the airline expected to lose domestic share to Qantas as it exited unprofitable routes. It has also closed low-cost arm Tigerair Australia.
Qantas said last month it expected its domestic market share could rise to 70% from its pre-pandemic level of 60% as the market recovers because Virgin is reducing the size of its fleet.

Both airlines are operating skeleton domestic schedules at present due to Australian state border restrictions put in place to limit the spread of the coronavirus pandemic.

135,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 09, 2020 05:10AM ET</span>","AstraZeneca pauses coronavirus vaccine trial, rollout doubts dent shares","LONDON (Reuters) - AstraZeneca (L:AZN) has paused global trials of its experimental coronavirus vaccine after an unexplained illness in a participant, denting the British drugmaker's shares on Wednesday as the move was seen as dimming prospects for an early rollout.
On Tuesday, AstraZeneca said it voluntarily paused trials, including late-stage ones, to allow an independent committee to review safety data, and it was working to expedite the review to minimise any potential impact on the trial timeline.
The vaccine, which AstraZeneca is developing with the University of Oxford, has been described by the World Health Organization (WHO) as probably the world's leading candidate and the most advanced in terms of development.
""It is obviously a challenge to this particular vaccine trial,"" Britain's Health Secretary Matt Hancock told Sky News, adding: ""It's not actually the first time this has happened to the Oxford vaccine"".
The trial's suspension triggered a 2% fall in AstraZeneca's shares in London and a 12% drop in the stock price of its Indian unit,  AstraZeneca Pharma India  Ltd (NS:ASTR). AstraZeneca shares, which have the second biggest weighting in the FTSE 100 index, were down 0.3% at 0820 GMT.
It follows reports that the United States was aiming for a fast-track approval before the November presidential election.
Asked whether the pause would set back the vaccine development process, Britain's Hancock said: ""Not necessarily, it depends on what they find when they do the investigation.""
The BBC reported that a final decision on restarting the trial will be taken by the medical regulator the MHRA, which could take only days.
""This is a routine action which has to happen whenever there is a potentially unexplained illness in one of the trials,"" the AstraZeneca said in an emailed statement.
The nature of the illness was not disclosed, although the participant is expected to recover, according to Stat News, which first reported the suspension due to a ""suspected serious adverse reaction"". 
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration defines an adverse event as one in which evidence suggests a possible relationship to the drug being tested.
A New York Times report citing a person familiar with the situation said a participant based in Britain was found to have transverse myelitis, an inflammatory syndrome that affects the spinal cord and is often sparked by viral infections.
Whether this was directly linked to AstraZeneca's vaccine remains unclear, the report said. AstraZeneca declined to comment.
'HISTORIC PLEDGE'
Called AZD1222, the vaccine is in late-stage clinical trials in the United States, Britain, Brazil and South Africa and additional trials are planned in Japan and Russia. The trials aim to enrol up to 50,000 participants globally.
South Korea said on Wednesday it would look into the suspension and review its plan to participate in the manufacturing of the vaccine. 
""It's not rare that clinical trials get suspended as various factors interact,"" health ministry official Yoon Tae-ho told a briefing. 
The decision to put the trial on hold has impacted clinical trials being conducted by other vaccine makers, which are looking for signs of similar reactions, Stat said.
The U.S. National Institutes of Health, which is providing funding for AstraZeneca's trial, declined to comment. 
 Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) said in an emailed statement it was ""not aware of any impact"" to its ongoing COVID-19 vaccine study at this time. 
Nine leading U.S. and European vaccine developers pledged on Tuesday to uphold scientific safety and efficacy standards for their experimental vaccines despite the urgency to contain the coronavirus pandemic.
The companies, including AstraZeneca, Moderna and  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE), issued what they called a ""historic pledge"" after a rise in concern that safety standards might slip in the face of political pressure to rush out a vaccine. 
The companies said they would ""uphold the integrity of the scientific process as they work towards potential global regulatory filings and approvals of the first COVID-19 vaccines."" 

The other signatories were Johnson & Johnson (N:JNJ),  Merck & Co  (N:MRK), GlaxoSmithKline (L:GSK),  Novavax  Inc (O:NVAX), Sanofi (PA:SASY) and BioNTech (F:22UAy).

BEIJING/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Chinese tech giant Baidu (O:BIDU) is in talks with investors to raise up to $2 billion over three years for a biotech startup, which will use AI technology to discover new drugs and diagnose diseases, a person with direct knowledge of the matter said.
A second person confirmed the startup plan. 
Baidu (O:BIDU) is unlikely to be the controlling investor, the first person said. Both sources spoke on condition of anonymity, adding they did not have more details on the investment as talks were still under way.
Baidu's plans come at a time of increased investment in the healthcare sector since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, with many companies expanding into online diagnosis options to fill the gaps left by overstretched, overcrowded hospitals. 
WeDoctor, backed by Tencent (HK:0700),  Alibaba 's (N:BABA) healthcare arm and Ping An Good Doctor (HK:1833) have joined the fray to develop apps that offer diagnosis, prescriptions, appointment bookings, 1-hour drug delivery and insurance.
But the startup under discussion plans to focus more on such areas as drug discovery and development, and early tumor diagnosis, by mobilizing Baidu's powerful artificial intelligence (AI) technology that can perform complex computing to produce biological innovations, the sources said.
The name of the startup has not been decided, but Baidu came up with the idea as early as six months ago, one of the sources said, adding that Baidu founder and Chairman Robin Li has been personally involved in the project.
Baidu declined to comment. 
Baidu open-sourced its Ribonucleic acid (RNA) prediction algorithm LinearFold this year. The tool aims to accelerate the prediction time of a virus' RNA secondary structure, which is crucial to understand a virus and develop vaccines. 
The healthcare industry, especially biotechnology, has seen a flood of money flow in amid the scramble for a COVID-19 vaccine and governments seeking to fix their health systems. 

The Hang Seng Healthcare Index (HSHCI) has surged about 40% over the past five months, outstripping the Hang Seng Index (HSI) that edged up more than 6% over the time.

The news earlier unnerved investors hoping the quick introduction of a vaccine would help accelerate the recovery for economies ravaged by the pandemic. 
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan (MIAPJ0000PUS) slid 1%, with indexes in Australia (AXJO), China (CSI300) and Japan (N225) all skidding.
Bond yields fell and the Japanese yen  climbed to a one-week high of 105.93 per dollar as investors sought safety.
Still, Wall Street futures gauges (ESc1) (NQc1) were pointing to a bounce for the S&P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq, up 0.5% and 1.4% respectively.
The MSCI world equity index (MIWD00000PUS), which tracks shares in nearly 50 countries, was flat.
With Big Tech the main winners in the global recovery from the coronavirus, benefiting from stay-at-home spenders, investors were mostly sanguine about the sector's prospects, even after the bruising sell-off.
The Nasdaq has lost $1.5 trillion since hitting a Sept. 2 peak. 
""This has been a correction that was probably not that surprising, given the move in August in the tech sector,"" said Salman Baig, an investment manager at Unigestion, adding that the outlook for Big Tech was positive. 
""It's exactly those companies that are new economy - they are benefiting because of their model, the industry, the virus.""
Those attributes have sparked heavy bets from the likes of SoftBank, which has traded heavily in tech stocks call options.
The bets have unnerved investors worried about its exposure to the sector. SoftBank Group (T:9984) shares lost 3% in Tokyo, extending this week's slump that has wiped $15 billion from its market capitalisation.
Despite renewed appetite for stocks, safe-haven German government bond yields (DE10IT10=RR) fell to their lowest in two-weeks. The fall in tech shares also boosted demand for U.S. Treasuries, even though heavy supply this week is expected to weigh on the bonds. 
VACCINE ""BLOW""
The remarkable rally in global shares from their March lows has been driven in part by expectations that a COVID-19 vaccine would be found, helping to accelerate the economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic. 
Yet AstraZeneca's move dims prospects for an early rollout of its vaccine, described by the World Health Organization as probably the world's leading candidate and the most advanced in terms of development. 
 Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) strategists called the suspension of the trials ""a blow"".
AstraZeneca shares recovered ground after falling heavily in after-hours U.S. trading, and were last down 0.6%. 
Elsewhere, sterling  was stalked by fears that Britain is preparing to undercut its Brexit divorce treaty. 
Britain will set out new details of its blueprint for life outside the European Union, publishing legislation a minister acknowledged would break international law and which could sour trade talks.

Sterling dipped 0.3% to $1.2945, its lowest since the end of July, and also fell the same amount against the euro (EURGBP=D3) to 90.70 pence, its lowest for six weeks.

138,By Investing.com,"<span>Sep 09, 2020 04:05AM ET</span>",European Stocks Higher; Investors Look to The ECB,"By Peter Nurse 
Investing.com - European stock markets traded higher Wednesday, with investors taking a potential delay to a Covid vaccine and heavy selling of U.S. tech stocks in their stride ahead of Thursday’s ECB meeting.
At 4:05 AM ET (0805 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 1.1% higher, the CAC 40 in France rose 0.9% and the U.K.'s FTSE index was up 1.2%.
AstraZeneca (NYSE:AZN) announced late Tuesday it had paused a late-stage trial of one of the leading Covid-19 vaccine candidates due to an unexplained illness in a study participant.
However, AstraZeneca stock only dropped 0.4% in European trading, with investors seemingly satisfied with the pharma giant's explanation that the pause was ""a routine action which has to happen whenever there is a potentially unexplained illness in one of the trials.""
This comes as coronavirus cases have started growing again in a number of European countries, prompting a number of travel restrictions, while the U.K. tightened rules surrounding social gatherings, limiting groups to a maximum of six people. 
This all puts the focus squarely on the European Central Bank, which meets on Thursday, as increased restrictions, a firmer euro and signs that the economic recovery is slowing boost the case for more monetary stimulus. 
The sell-off in big tech stocks continued Tuesday, resulting in large losses overnight on Wall Street. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 2.3%, or 632 points. The S&P 500 was down 2.8%, while the Nasdaq Composite slumped 4.1% into correction territory, with losses of about 10% in the past three days.
In corporate news,  Tullow Oil  (LON:TLW) slumped 11% after posting a $1.3 billion loss in the first half of the year and writing off $1.4 billion due to a lowering of its price outlook.
Staying with oil, crude prices bounced Wednesday, recovering some of the previous session’s sharp selloff which saw the international benchmark Brent contract trade below $40 a barrel for the first time since late June.
The oil market will have a lot to digest during the session, with the OPEC monthly report and the Energy Information Administration's Short-Term Energy Outlook due for release later Wednesday. 
Additionally, the weekly API report, due a day later than usual due to Monday’s holiday, is likely to show another draw in crude stockpiles for the week ended Sept. 6.
U.S. crude futures traded 2.1% higher at $37.52 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract rose 1.5% to $40.38.
Elsewhere, gold futures fell 0.2% to $1,939.60/oz, while EUR/USD traded largely flat at 1.1778."

DUBAI (Reuters) - Israel's largest lender  Bank Hapoalim  (TA:POLI) expects to start working with banks in the United Arab Emirates once the two Middle East states sign a normalisation agreement, its chief executive said on Wednesday. 
The UAE and Israel are due to sign the agreement, brokered by the United States, on Sept. 15 at a ceremony held by U.S. President Donald Trump. 
The three sides have talked up the economic opportunities that normalisation would bring and several business cooperation agreements have already been signed. 
Hapoalim CEO Dov Kotler said a correspondent banking relationship facilitating direct money transfers between the countries would help develop trade and business ties.
""I believe that after the governments sign the agreement next week we will be able to work with the banking system here,"" he told Reuters during a visit to the UAE.
In correspondent banking, a bank with no branch or network in a given country will typically channel payments there through a local bank that acts on its behalf. 
Kotler is leading an Israeli business delegation on a two-day visit to the UAE as the two countries develop bilateral economic relations.
""We are here to build trust before talking business. In order to build trust I believe we have to meet face to face and that is what we are doing,"" he said.
Israel and the UAE on Aug. 13 agreed to normalise relations, making the UAE the first Gulf country and the third Arab state to do so when a final accord is signed.
Kotler said he believed Hapoalim would establish relationships with the three largest lenders in the UAE, though declined to name the banks.
The UAE's largest lender First Abu Dhabi Bank (AD:FAB) has said it would open discussions with Hapoalim and Bank Leumi (TA:LUMI), another Israeli bank.
Bank Leumi is to lead a delegation to the UAE on Sept. 14.

Emirates BND (DU:ENBD), Dubai's largest bank, declined to comment on the visit of Hapoalim this week.

NEW DELHI/BENGALURU (Reuters) -  Reliance Industries  Ltd (NS:RELI) said on Wednesday U.S. private equity firm Silver Lake Partners will invest $1.02 billion in its retail business, helping the Mukesh Ambani-controlled company widen its lead as India's biggest retailer. 
The move also sets the stage for a three-way battle between Asia's richest man, Jeff Bezos' Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) and Walmart Inc's (N:WMT) Flipkart to rope in the Indian middle class customer, many of whom are newly adopting online purchases of food and groceries due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
In May, Reliance launched online grocery service JioMart. It has been aggressively building its retail presence through acquisitions, moving beyond its mainstay oil and gas business.
Silver Lake will get a 1.75% stake in Reliance Retail, giving the business a pre-money equity value of 4.21 trillion rupees ($57.14 billion), Reliance said https://www.bseindia.com/xml-data/corpfiling/AttachLive/7de51cca-6592-4aa6-a06c-da43f7272cd5.pdf. Powered by Reliance's Jio tech platform, the unit owns retail businesses as varied as grocery stores and fashion chains, and operates close to 12,000 stores.
""The real competition is going to be between Amazon, Walmart and Reliance,"" said Harminder Sahni of retail consultancy Wazir Advisors. ""Walmart is self-funded and Amazon is too, so the company to bet on now is Reliance.""
Reliance, which has been on a fund-raising spree, saw its share price rise as much as 1.5% in a weak Mumbai market (NSEI).
Silver Lake, whose portfolio includes stakes in Airbnb and  Twitter Inc  (N:TWTR), has previously invested in Reliance's digital business as part of a funding round that saw the Indian company raise more than $20 billion from investors including  Facebook Inc  (O:FB) and Alphabet Inc's (O:GOOGL) Google.
KKR & Co Inc (N:KKR) is in advanced talks to invest at least $1 billion in Reliance Retail, Bloomberg reported on Wednesday, citing people familiar with the matter. Reliance declined to comment on the report when contacted by Reuters.

141,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 09, 2020 02:20AM ET</span>",Explainer: A peek into China's $14.6 trillion asset management industry,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China is further opening up its financial markets to overseas investors, easing restrictions on foreign investments in securities, retail funds, private funds, banking and insurance fields. 
Below is a slew of information, compiled by the Asset Management Association of China, Beijing Asset Management Association, Beijing Private Equity Association and CFA Institute, for foreign institutions that want to participate in China's more than 100 trillion yuan ($14.60 trillion) asset management industry. 
OVERSEAS ASSET MANAGEMENT INSTITUTIONS THAT CAN BE ESTABLISHED 
Fund Management Company (FMC (NYSE:FMC)), Securities Company, Private Securities Investment Fund Manager (PFM), Qualified Domestic Limited Partnership (QDLP), Qualified Foreign Limited Partner (QFLP), Wealth Management Subsidiaries of Commercial Bank, Insurance Asset Management Company and Trust Company. 
CROSS-BORDER INVESTMENTS THAT CAN BE CARRIED OUT BY OVERSEAS ASSET MANAGEMENT INSTITUTIONS 
QFII, RQFII, Stock Connect, Direct investment in the interbank bond market (CIBM Direct), Bond Connect, qualified specific types of commodity futures, Mutual Fund Recognition (Northbound Fund) and China Themed ETF listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
REGULATORS
Currently, the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) is the administrative authority for public funds, the private asset management business of securities and futures institutions, and private investment funds. 
The China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (CBIRC) is the administrative authority for the wealth management business and subsidiaries of commercial banks and the asset management business of the trust and insurance companies. 
At present, beyond the regulations set by the CSRC and the CBIRC, to conduct asset management business in China, the Guidance on Regulating the Asset Management Business of Financial Institutions must be complied with. 
In addition, the Asset Management Association of China has established a relatively complete set of self-regulatory rules covering private investment fund management institutions, fund products, qualified investors, fund custody, fund sales, fund investment, information disclosure, accounting, fund valuation and outsourcing of services, etc. 
TYPES OF ASSET MANAGEMENT PRODUCTS 
Generally, the asset management products in China are organised in three forms: contract type, partnership type and company type. 
The partnership type and company type asset management products need to be registered as business entities with the industrial and commercial administrative departments, while the private type products should be registered with the Asset Management Association of China (AMAC). 
In practice, asset management products such as private equity management products and private equity investment funds of securities and futures management institutions are usually contract type products which boil down to a fiduciary relationship. 
Commercial banks, wealth management subsidiaries of commercial banks, trust companies and insurance companies mostly conduct private asset management business using contracts and offer equity, debt, real estate investment, trust plans and wealth management products.
LEGAL FRAMEWORK
Asset management products usually involve investors, managers, custodians, underlying asset and other subjects.

Investing.com - European stock markets are seen opening largely lower Wednesday, weighed by the rout of technology shares on Wall Street as well as concerns about the increase of coronavirus cases.
At 2:05 AM ET (0605 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.2% higher, CAC 40 futures in France fell 0.2%, while the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. dropped 0.4%. 
The sell-off in big tech stocks continued Tuesday, resulting in large losses overnight on Wall Street. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 2.3%, or 632 points. The S&P 500 was down 2.8%, while the Nasdaq Composite slumped 4.1% into correction territory, with losses of about 10% in the past three days.
""The performance of Wall Street is going to leave a heavy residue, and most noteworthy is how the tech names dropped down quite aggressively. Investors will take a close note of that,"" said Tom Piotrowski, a markets analyst at Australian broker CommSec, in a Reuters report.
Adding to the pessimism was the news that pharma giant AstraZeneca (LON:AZN) paused a late-stage trial of one of the leading Covid-19 vaccine candidates due to an unexplained illness in a study participant.
This vaccine candidate, which AstraZeneca is developing with the University of Oxford, had been seen as one of the forerunners in the race to reach the market in the search for a cure for Covid-19.
This comes as coronavirus cases continue to rise in a number of countries in Europe, India and several parts of the U.S., where the infection rates have not been contained for months. 
The number of global cases continues to rise, breaching the 27.5 million level as of September 9, according to Johns Hopkins University data.
Oil prices weakened Wednesday, continuing the previous session’s sharp selloff which saw the international benchmark Brent contract trade below $40 a barrel for the first time since late June.
“There was no clear catalyst for the move, however, a stronger dollar and weaker equities would have done little to help sentiment, not just for oil, but the broader commodities complex,” said analysts at ING, in a research note. “Looking at fundamentals, and while stalling demand has been a concern for most in the market for a while, it is becoming more evident.”
The oil market will have a lot to digest during the session, with the OPEC monthly report and the Energy Information Administration's Short-Term Energy Outlook due for release later Wednesday. 
Additionally, the weekly API report, due a day later than usual due to Monday’s holiday, is likely to show another draw in crude stockpiles for the week ended Sept. 6.
U.S. crude futures traded 0.3% lower at $36.66 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract fell 0.2% to $39.69.

The 1,470-km (910-mile) train project is designed to link tourist hot spots and spur development on the Yucatan Peninsula at an estimated cost of $7 billion.
Deemed essential infrastructure by the government, the rail project is a top priority of President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who hopes it will be a major generator of jobs in the country's poorer south.
Mexico's National Fund for Tourism Promotion (Fonatur) initially planned to announce the decision on Aug. 31, but said it needed more time to analyze the proposal from BlackRock and its partners.
BlackRock did not respond outside of U.S. office hours.
The Greenfield SPV VIII proposal, a consortium with BlackRock Mexico Infraestructura II and other companies, was the only bidder for the 121-km (75-mile) ""section 5"" that runs from Cancun to Tulum in Quintana Roo state.

Fonatur said in a statement late Tuesday that the bid's economic proposal was ""not solvent"" and that it would open another bidding process for ""section 5"" under a different scheme that has yet to be determined.

Samsung Display, which counts Samsung Electronics and Apple (O:AAPL) as major customers for OLED display screens, declined comment.
LG Display said in a statement the U.S. move will have a minimal impact on the company given its limited panel shipments to Huawei, adding it will continue to diversify its customer base. 
The U.S. further tightened restrictions on Huawei in August, banning suppliers from selling chips made using U.S. technology to the Chinese telecom giant without a special license.

Samsung Display and LG Display decided to stop the supply to Huawei from when the restrictions take effect on Sept. 15, as the ban includes chips needed to operate displays, and orders from Huawei do not take up a large portion of their business compared to customers like Apple, Chosun Biz reported, citing industry sources.

(Reuters) - AstraZeneca (NYSE:AZN) Plc on Tuesday said it has paused global trials, including large late-stage trials, of its experimental coronavirus vaccine because of an unexplained illness in a study participant.
The vaccine, developed with the University of Oxford, has been widely seen as one of the leading global candidates against the coronavirus, and the suspension of the trial dims prospects for a potential year-end rollout its lead developer had signaled earlier.
AstraZeneca said it voluntarily paused trials to allow review of safety data by an independent committee and was working to expedite the review of the single event to minimize any potential impact on the trial timeline.
""This is a routine action which has to happen whenever there is a potentially unexplained illness in one of the trials,"" the company said in an emailed statement.
The nature of the illness and when it happened were not detailed, although the participant is expected to recover, according to Stat News, which first reported the suspension due to a ""suspected serious adverse reaction"". 
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration defines an adverse event as one in which evidence suggests a possible relationship to the drug being tested.
According to a New York Times report which cited a person familiar with the situation, a participant based in the United Kingdom was found to have transverse myelitis, an inflammatory syndrome that affects the spinal cord and is often sparked by viral infections.
Whether the illness was directly linked to AstraZeneca's vaccine remains unclear, the report said. AstraZeneca declined to comment on the report. 
The suspension of the trial has impacted other AstraZeneca vaccine trials - as well as clinical trials being conducted by other vaccine makers, which are looking for signs of similar reactions, Stat said.
The U.S. National Institutes of Health, which is providing funding for AstraZeneca's trial, declined to comment. 
AstraZeneca's statement said that ""in large trials, illnesses will happen by chance but must be independently reviewed to check this carefully.""
Trials of the vaccine, called AZD1222, are underway at different stages in Britain, the United States, Brazil, South Africa and India. Trials are also planned in Japan and Russia.
Shares of AstraZeneca fell more than 8% in after-hours U.S. trading, while shares of rival vaccine developers rose.  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc was up more than 4% and  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) climbed less than 1%.
Moderna said in an emailed statement it was ""not aware of any impact"" to its ongoing COVID-19 vaccine study at this time. 
Nine leading U.S. and European vaccine developers pledged on Tuesday to uphold scientific safety and efficacy standards for their experimental vaccines despite the urgency to contain the coronavirus pandemic.
The companies, including AstraZeneca, Moderna and Pfizer, issued what they called a ""historic pledge"" after a rise in concern that safety standards might slip in the face of political pressure to rush out a vaccine. 
The companies said they would ""uphold the integrity of the scientific process as they work towards potential global regulatory filings and approvals of the first COVID-19 vaccines."" 

The other signatories were Johnson & Johnson, Merck & Co, GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE:GSK),  Novavax  (NASDAQ:NVAX) Inc,  Sanofi  (NASDAQ:SNY) and BioNTech.

Investing.com – Asian stocks were down on Wednesday morning, with investors inspecting the damage after U.S. markets saw a second rout in U.S. tech stocks in less than a week during the previous session.
Tuesday’s rout was triggered in part by Britain’s AstraZeneca (NYSE:AZN) pushing the pause button on trials of its COVID-19 vaccine candidate that it is developing with the University of Oxford, one of the forerunners in the race to reach the market as a cure for COVID-19. The pause, reportedly due to an adverse reaction in a trial participant in the U.K., saw the company's U.S. shares fall as much as 8.3%. But it pledged not to take shortcuts even amid the pressure to complete the trials and release the vaccine into the market as quickly as possible.
Investors are assessing whether the pullback for stocks could indicate either the true state of the market’s health, or the start of a longer, larger downturn.
“The path of least resistance for the market may well be to test the downside … ultimately, if there is more selloff, I suspect real money investors will take the opportunity to buy the dip,” Mizuho International Plc head of multi-asset strategy Peter Chatwell told Bloomberg.

148,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 08, 2020 09:30PM ET</span>",Liquidation business booms in South Korea as wave of small retailers close due to virus,"By Cynthia Kim and Hyun Young Yi
SEOUL (Reuters) - You Young-sik has tried his luck running businesses, but when his convenience store, a sausage factory and a second-hand furniture shop all failed, he realised he had found a niche, one that he understood well: helping people go out of business.
You says he is now busier than ever, due to the resurgence in coronavirus, tearing down sign boards and cash registers at shuttered hair salons, BBQ buffets and other places whose business model is based around human contact.
""This is my busiest year so far, having done this for 10 years. Inquiries are about four to five times higher,"" said 54-year-old liquidation specialist, who added that his business started taking off about two years ago as a street-level economic downturn began.
""I can’t do them all but I still take about twice the work I used to, which is why I need to head out at 4 or 5 in the morning,"" said You in the city of Suwon, south of Seoul, as he answers telephone calls and tightens ropes around tables and chairs on his truck.
Tough social distancing rules to curb a second wave of coronavirus have markedly slowed retail traffic and emptied cafes across Seoul since mid-August.
The tables and chairs that You collects from closing businesses will end up in recycled kitchenware shops, such as Dajoobang in a run-down part of Seoul’s Hwanghakdong.
“Our 600-pyeong (21,350 square feet) storage warehouse has been completely full for about two months,” said Cho Gye-su, a 53-year-old manager at Dajoobang.
“Second-hand goods have been piling up and we have nowhere to sell them to, so the coronavirus has been really bad for us,” said Cho, pointing to used fridges, rice cookers and waffle makers all cleaned up and displayed in glass racks.
FAMILY RETAILERS BATTERED
Inventory glut at recycled kitchenware stores and booming liquidation businesses point to battered family retailers in every corner of the country.
While policymakers brag that retail sales returned to growth in June and per-day exports recorded the slowest decline in 7 months in August, small businesses are failing at a rate not seen since the global financial crisis, data from the Korea Statistics shows.
The hardest hit sectors in Asia's fourth largest economy include hospitality, retail and restaurants, which are traditionally small, family-run businesses.
South Korea has one of the world's highest proportion of self-employed people, about 25% of the job market, making it very vulnerable to downturns. A 2017 Bank of Korea study showed only 38% of the self-employed businesses survive three years.
New retirees seeking to supplement pensions by opening fried chicken diners or coffee shops and unemployed youth starting their own cafes have driven demand for second-hand sales for liquidators like You.
But unprecedented social distancing restrictions imposed on eateries in Seoul since late August, banning onsite dining after 9 p.m. and limiting coffee and bakery franchises to takeout and delivery, has made trading tough for new start-ups.
The government has warned South Koreans for several years not to open more fried chicken shops or cafes as the small hospitality sector is saturated.
Small business profit margins were thinning before COVID-19.
On top of the coronavirus pandemic, that has also fuelled an acceleration of e-commerce, small businesses are fighting spiking rents, a shorter work week and higher minimum wages under the left-leaning President Moon Jae-in.
Moon has raised the legal minimum wage by about a third in the past three years to 8,720 won ($7.2) an hour for 2021 and capped weekly work hours to 52 hours, raising costs and making lay offs inevitable for small businesses.
Statistics Korea data show the number of self-employed businesses were down by 128,000 in July from a year earlier to 5.55 million, logging the biggest drop since the comparable period of 2009.
Kim Da-eun, 27, ran a private tuition school for the past three years in Anseong, south of Seoul, but is now shuttering it as the number of students has dropped below 10, down from 40 last year, as the coronavirus outbreak kept many at home.
""I'm now looking for a job but I don't see anyone hiring. So I will be sticking to my delivery part-time for a while,"" Kim said, observing the demolition of her business.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Duracell, the battery unit of Warren Buffett's  Berkshire Hathaway Inc  (N:BRKa), sued the maker of Energizer batteries on Tuesday, accusing it falsely advertising that its Energizer MAX batteries last up to 50% longer than other alkaline batteries.
The lawsuit follows Energizer Holdings Inc's (N:ENR) own lawsuit last Sept. 30 accusing Duracell of falsely advertising that its then-new ""Optimum"" batteries were more powerful and lasted longer than rival batteries.
Duracell filed counterclaims alleging false advertising in that case. It is now accusing Energizer of having ""doubled down"" by claiming on battery packages, on printed coupons and through in-store advertising that MAX batteries are ""up to 50% longer lasting than basic alkaline in demanding devices.""
Energizer is attempting ""to confuse and mislead consumers regarding the comparative benefits of Energizer's MAX batteries relative to other alkaline batteries,"" including Duracell's Coppertop batteries, Duracell's complaint said.
Lawyers for Energizer did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Both lawsuits were filed in Manhattan federal court.
The companies have sought damages for false advertising under New York law and the federal Lanham Act, as well as halts to any improper advertising.
Duracell said it had a 45% share of the U.S. market for alkaline household batteries, while Energizer has a 26% share.
Berkshire bought Duracell, which has offices in Bethel, Connecticut, from Procter & Gamble Co (N:PG) in February 2016. Energizer is based in St. Louis.

The company said it offered credits, payment in installments and billing duration of less than a year to help users tide over the economic downturn triggered by the health crisis, sending its shares down 18% after the bell.
Slack had in the previous quarter signaled weak demand from worst-affected industries like retail and travel, prompting it to withdraw its full-year billings target.
""In Q2, growth in many of our customers contracted or flattened versus normal seasonal trends. In August, growth began to trend at more typical seasonal levels,"" Chief Financial Officer Allen Shim said in a call with analysts. 
Slack's quarterly billings rose 25%, but it fell short of the 38% growth it posted in the first quarter. Billings are an important metric for growth for a subscription-based platform like Slack.
Its second-quarter revenue topped expectations by nearly $7 million, but that overachievement was not mirrored in the full-year outlook. 
Slack's annual revenue forecast of $870 million-$876 million was roughly in line with expectations of $872.3 million.

Excluding items, the company broke even, compared with analysts' average estimate of a loss of 3 cents per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

(Reuters) - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc shed about $80 billion of its market value on Tuesday, an amount that overshadows the combined value of General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) and Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co, after its surprise exclusion from the S&P 500 index. 
Tesla's shares recorded their worst single-day percentage drop ever and added to the broader sell-off in technology stocks, which have dominated Wall Street's recovery from the coronavirus-driven crash earlier this year.
The stock closed 21.06% lower, while fellow electric automaker Nikola Corp jumped more than 40% after General Motors said it was acquiring an 11% stake in the company.
Wall Street analysts and investors widely expected Tesla to join the S&P 500 after the company posted its fourth consecutive profitable quarter in July, clearing a major hurdle for its potential inclusion in the benchmark stock index.
In a surprise announcement, the S&P Dow Jones Indices decided to add online craft seller Etsy (NASDAQ:ETSY) Inc, semiconductor equipment maker Teradyne (NASDAQ:TER) Inc and pharmaceutical technology company Catalent (NYSE:CTLT) Inc to the S&P 500 instead.
""On the one hand, the slide in the share price is due to its non-inclusion in the S&P 500, but on the other hand the slide is also a normalization of the company's valuation,"" Frank Schwope, an analyst at NORD/LB, said.
Tesla's inclusion in the S&P 500 index would have required a lot of funds to buy its shares.  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) analyst Dan Levy said the exclusion likely reflects the challenges in adding a company of Tesla's size to the index.
Bets against Tesla's stock have also increased slightly over the last month, according to financial analytics firm S3 Partners. 
On Tuesday morning, short interest in Tesla was $25.03 billion, with about 8.10% of its outstanding shares shorted.

Tesla's recent stock rally has been driven by its blockbuster quarterly results and on bets it would be added to the S&P 500, which would trigger massive demand for its shares from index funds that track the benchmark.

Other than agreeing that the German sector faced major economic and structural challenges, no concrete decisions were made at a two-hour video conference which included Merkel, regional leaders and auto bosses.
However, government spokesman Steffen Seibert said working groups would now explore ways to help firms suffering from the impact of the coronavirus pandemic which hit demand.
In particular, he said, the working groups would examine ""whether and how a market-economy concept could be developed to strengthen equity capital, especially of supplier companies.""
The government has already introduced a stimulus package, including measures to help the industry which accounts for about 832,000 jobs in Europe's biggest economy. Even before the coronavirus, the sector was struggling to rebuild a reputation tarnished by a diesel emissions scandal.
However, after months of talks, little has been agreed. The next round of talks is due to take place in November.
While Germany's multibillion-euro recovery plan includes some incentives for electric cars, Merkel's government has so far resisted calls from the industry to launch a scrappage scheme to boost sales of new combustion-engine cars.

Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) and  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) have said customers have returned to showrooms after coronavirus lockdowns eased, leading to a gradual rebound in demand in Europe and China.

SEATTLE/WASHINGTON (Reuters) -  Boeing Co  (N:BA) warned on Tuesday of delays in deliveries of its 787 Dreamliner, as three separate production flaws over the past year hamper efforts to develop an alternative cash cow to its grounded 737 MAX.
In the latest issue, Boeing learned during fabrication of the 787 horizontal stabilizer that some components were clamped with greater force than specified, which could result in improper gap verification and shimming. Boeing identified the problem in February and announced it on Tuesday.
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said Tuesday it ""is investigating manufacturing flaws affecting certain Boeing 787 jetliners. The agency continues to engage with Boeing.""
A person briefed on the matter said the horizontal stabilizer issue could require the inspection of as many as about 900 airplanes.
Boeing said the stabilizer issue, identified at a production plant in Salt Lake City, Utah, was being corrected on airplanes not yet delivered and was not an immediate flight safety issue.
""Analysis is underway to determine if action is required on the in-service fleet,"" Boeing added.
Boeing shares fell 5.8% Tuesday.
On Monday, the FAA said it was also investigating two other manufacturing flaws in some Boeing 787 Dreamliners, but said it was too early to say if it will require new inspections. 
Boeing said in late August that airlines had removed eight 787 Dreamliners from service as a result of two distinct manufacturing issues in fuselage sections.
Boeing said Monday some airplanes have shims that are not the proper size, and some airplanes have areas that do not meet skin flatness specifications.Boeing identified the shimming issue in August 2019.
""Individually these issues, while not up to specifications, still meet limit load conditions. When combined in the same location however, they result in a condition that does not meet limit load requirements,"" Boeing said.
Boeing said Tuesday it expects the inspections will affect the timing of 787 deliveries in the near-term.
Boeing also said Tuesday it secured its first 737 MAX order in 2020, while also recording more cancellations as customers continued to ditch orders for the grounded MAX jets.
Boeing said it lost another 17 orders for the 737 MAX jet in August, bringing the total number of canceled orders, including those where buyers converted the MAX to a different model, to 445 for this year.

Boeing delivered 13 aircraft in August, down from 18 planes a year earlier and up from four in July.

Shares in Cohn Robbins Holdings Corp , a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC), sold for $10 apiece, the standard typical price in SPAC IPOs.

Speaking at a virtual conference hosted by  Barclays  (LON:BARC), CEO Alan Jope said Unilever's board was ""absolutely committed"" to its proposal and is expecting ""strong shareholder support."" 
Jope repeated Unilever's belief that the law proposed in the Netherlands by the opposition Green Left party, which would result in an 11 billion euro ($12.96 billion) tax bill to the Dutch government, was illegal, but noted that it was still in its infancy. 
The Anglo-Dutch consumer goods maker said earlier this month that if the law gets enacted, its unification plans would change.
""We're not going to speculate on all the many paths this could take, but if there's a high probability that exit would be associated with an 11 billion euro tax bill, obviously that wouldn't be in shareholders' interest,"" Jope said in a presentation broadcast on the internet. 
""But personally, I think logic and common sense will prevail.""
Unilever, maker of Dove soap and Hellmann's mayonnaise, is hosting meetings on Sept. 21 in Rotterdam and Oct. 12 in London for shareholders to vote. 
When asked about the current macroeconomic environment, Jope said a global economic downturn was ""absolutely inevitable but we don't know its depth or how it will play out by country.""
He said gross margins could see pressure as its value brands become more popular. 
Still, the company's North American business is currently seeing ""sustained strength"", driven by hygiene products and food and market share gains online.

Moving forward, Jope said Unilever should continue to deliver annual cost savings, grow its revenues and increase its margins, though the margin growth may not be as fast as it was in prior years.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. corporate bond market has made a dramatic recovery from the early stages of the coronavirus pandemic, but it is unlikely to improve further in the near term, according to UBS Group (S:UBSG) analysts.
Spreads on U.S. corporate debt - the premium investors demand to hold the riskier credit over risk-free Treasuries - have narrowed dramatically since both the investment grade and high-yield ICE/BofA indexes hit 11-year lows on March 23. <.MERC0A0> (MERH0A0) 
That recovery is primarily attributable to the U.S. Federal Reserve's unprecedented intervention into credit markets, UBS said, enabling U.S. companies across the credit spectrum to continue borrowing in the public market. That support has been priced into the market at this point, leaving U.S. credit spreads with little room left for improvement until financial conditions change dramatically. 
""The easy part of the post-pandemic spread tightening is largely over for most credit risk assets. With the large monetary and fiscal stimulus already largely priced in, we believe the grind tighter in spreads will be much slower, if at all,"" wrote Barry McAlinden, fixed income strategist at UBS Wealth Management. 
The report by McAlinden and other UBS analysts, released on Thursday, also attributed the quick recovery in credit markets to a slower and more forgiving pace of downgrades by credit rating agencies and to the better financial health of Corporate America going into the coronavirus pandemic than in previous crises. 
UBS favors investment-grade credit over high yield.
Deleveraging or responsible increases in leverage are more likely to occur among companies with an interest in preserving their investment-grade credit ratings. Such creditor-friendly behavior could narrow spreads further. 
While the Fed's action has restored liquidity across the asset class, its bond-buying initiative focuses primarily on investment grade credit, a further boon.

WASHINGTON/CHICAGO (Reuters) - A fresh U.S. Senate Republican coronavirus spending package introduced on Tuesday does not include new government assistance for U.S. airlines or airports, a text of the proposal showed, as the sector races to save jobs before October.
More than 35,000 workers at two of the largest U.S. carriers alone - American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) and United Airlines - are set to lose their jobs once an initial $25 billion in payroll support from the government expires this month.
That has fueled a furious push by unions for a six-month extension of the aid, with flight attendants and other aviation workers planning to march outside the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday.
Last month a group of Senate Republicans backed extending $25 billion in payroll assistance for airlines, an idea Democrats also support.
That proposal was excluded from the latest Senate measure, which was reviewed by Reuters and is expected to be voted on Thursday, but it is an opening salvo for talks that are expected to intensify once the U.S. House returns from recess next week.
The Senate proposal also excludes $10 billion in assistance for airports that was part of an earlier Senate bill.
Republicans and Democrats have been jockeying for months over the next phase of coronavirus aid, after passing more than $3 trillion this year.
U.S. President Donald Trump has floated the idea of airline aid without congressional action, but officials said last week the administration has yet to settle on an approach.
One possibility under discussion was redirecting unspent funds from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act passed in March, people familiar with the matter said, though it was unclear how conditions could be set without going through Congress.
The initial $25 billion airline payroll aid included restrictions on share buybacks and executive compensation and required airlines to protect jobs and pay through September.

Airlines are bracing for a slow recovery from the coronavirus pandemic but say they need trained workers ready to service and fuel any economic rebound.

(Reuters) - Apple Inc (O:AAPL) on Tuesday filed counter claims against ""Fortnite"" creator Epic Games asking for lost App Store fees and other damages, and seeking an order to stop the game maker from operating its own in-app payment system.
Apple and Epic have been in a legal battle since August, when the maker of the popular game launched its own in-app payment system to circumvent what it called Apple's monopolistic practices. Apple's App Store requires developers to use Apple's payment system and pay a 30% commission.
Apple blocked Epic's ability to distribute updates or new apps through the App Store, and Epic sued Apple alleging that its App Store practices violate antitrust laws. The court allowed Apple to block Epic from distributing new titles as the case plays out, but the existing version of ""Fortnite"" still works, as does Epic's payment system.
Apple had said it would allow ""Fortnite"" back into the store if Epic removed the direct payment feature to comply with its developer agreement. But Epic has refused, saying complying with Apple's request would be ""to collude with Apple to maintain their monopoly over in-app payments on iOS.""
Apple's filing on Tuesday asks for monetary damages for Epic's payment system, seeking ""restitution and disgorgement of all earnings, profits, compensation, benefits, and other ill-gotten gains obtained by Epic as a result of its conduct.""
Apple did not specify how much money it was seeking over the payment feature. The company also asked for damages for harm to its reputation from frustrated ""Fortnite"" players and a public relations campaign Epic launched against Apple, which included a parody of Apple's ""1984"" television commercial and a playable apple-headed character called ""Tart Tycoon"" that bears some resemblance to Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook.

Apple also sought a court order that would force Epic to disable its own payment system in ""Fortnite"" on Apple devices.

Airbus said it had delivered 39 jets in August, down from 49 a month earlier and slightly below the 41 in August last year. About a quarter of the deliveries were for low-cost carriers that are riding out the crisis relatively well compared to traditional rivals, such as India's Indigo and Hungary's Wizz.
Boeing, whose 737 MAX has been grounded for more than a year over two fatal crashes, delivered 13 jets in August.
Underlying deliveries at both planemakers are well below normal as airlines delay taking planes during the pandemic.
Airbus said it had delivered 284 aircraft so far in 2020, down 43% from 500 in the same period of 2019. Boeing delivered 87 jets in the first eight months, down from 276 a year earlier.
Boeing on Tuesday warned of delays to deliveries of its 787 Dreamliner as it reported a new production flaw.
Demand for wide-bodied jets such as the 787 and Airbus A350 has been left reeling by the global pandemic.
Airbus delivered four wide-bodied aircraft in August including one to its own military arm and one to Hong Kong's Cathay Pacific (HK:0293), easing a backlog of undelivered A350s parked in Cathay livery outside Airbus factories.
Cathay said in July it had reached agreement with Airbus over a new timetable involving deferred deliveries.
With the aircraft market stagnant, Airbus sold one jet in August, a private A320neo to an undisclosed buyer.
Boeing booked its first order for the 737 MAX since the start of the year but took new cancellations for the airplane, which is severely delayed as regulators examine design changes to address safety concerns.

So far this year, Airbus has sold 370 aircraft or 303 after allowing for cancellations. Boeing has sold 67 jets but a slew of MAX cancellations has pushed its net order tally for the first eight months of the year to a negative total of 378.

Ryanair announced last month that it will reduce its flight capacity by a further 20% during September and October with the cuts heavily focused on France, Spain, Ireland and Sweden due to the reimposition of travel restrictions.
The Irish airline has been most critical of the approach in its home country, where unencumbered travel is only allowed to and from 10 European countries. It initiated legal proceedings against the government, questioning the legality of the curbs.
The threatened closures would affect 130 directly employed staff as well as contract workers, Irish national broadcaster RTE reported, citing a letter from Eddie Wilson, chief executive of Ryanair's main airlines business. 
An airline spokesman said it did not comment on internal communication with its staff.
Ryanair, the largest budget carrier in Europe, operates from 82 bases.
The ""green list"" of countries exempt from the restrictions is under review after a rise in Irish COVID-19 cases made adding countries with a similar or slightly better incidence rate too risky, the health minister said last week.
Arrivals from all other countries are legally obliged to self-isolate for 14 days, contributing to a collapse in inbound tourism since Ireland reported its first COVID-19 cases at the end of February.

Ryanair group CEO Michael O'Leary said last month that forward bookings in and out of Ireland were ""terrible"" as a result with a 50% year-on-year drop putting jobs at risk in its Irish operations.

169,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 08, 2020 02:18PM ET</span>",Biden to Unveil Offshoring Plan as Trump’s Edge on Economy Dims,"(Bloomberg) -- Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden is launching a new push on economic issues as polls show voters beginning to trust his approach to reversing the job losses and manufacturing contraction brought on by the coronavirus pandemic.Biden opens the new front with a campaign trip to Michigan on Wednesday, a must-win state that Democrats just barely lost in 2016.
There he’ll unveil a new policy aimed at tackling offshoring -- the practice of U.S. companies basing some operations in lower-tax countries -- and hammer at what he sees as President Donald Trump’s broken promises on improving U.S. manufacturing and reducing offshoring, senior policy adviser Jake Sullivan said.
“Offshoring, outsourcing, Buy American. These are areas where Donald Trump’s record has not been remotely matched by the reality,” he said.
Between 2016 and 2018, the most recent year for which data is available, the U.S. lost 1,800 factories to offshoring and outsourcing, according to the progressive Economic Policy Institute. Some projects that the Trump administration heralded for bringing jobs back to the U.S. are unlikely to deliver on their promise, such as the FoxConn plant in Wisconsin that Trump celebrated in 2018 as “the Eighth Wonder of the World,” while others are making progress.
Trump has also criticized offshoring, taking a tough line on China while arguing that Biden will cave to Beijing’s demands. At a news conference on Monday, Trump threatened to “impose tariffs on companies that desert America to create jobs in China and other countries.” Trump also vowed to prohibit federal contracts for companies that outsource to China.
Standing on Economy Improves
Biden turns to economic issues as recent polls show his standing on the issue improving. It has long been the one policy area where the former vice president lagged Trump. But in several new polls, Biden is tied or within 1 point of Trump on who voters trust to handle the economy.
Biden also gets marks from voters for his focus on the pandemic, as voters indicate they believe that any economic recovery is tied to the safety of people returning to work, school, restaurants and shopping. Trump tends to minimize the virus’s impact on the economy as he pushes for a swift reopening.
As polling on the economy has shifted toward Biden, Trump is warning his supporters that a Biden victory would tank the stock market, which he frequently conflates with the full U.S. economy.
“Joe Biden and the radical, socialist Democrats would immediately collapse the economy. If they got in, they would collapse it,” the president said during a Labor Day news conference. “You’ll have a crash the likes of which you’ve never seen before. Your stocks, your 401(k)s — remember, it’s the people that own these massive, listed companies. A lot of people: rich people and not so rich people and middle-income people. And those stocks will crash like you’ve never seen before.”
The Democratic campaign will be focused in early fall on asking three economic questions for voters. “Who do you trust to get Covid under control? We can’t get the economy fully back before we deal with the virus effectively,” Sullivan said.
The second question, and the one Biden will focus on this week is “who can you actually believe on their promises on the economy?” The third is “who’s on my side?” and who will focus on working- and middle-class Americans, Sullivan said.Biden’s effort will build on the economic plan he released in July, which he calls the Build Back Better plan.The Build Back Better message, amplified by advertising spending on the economy, has contributed to his improved numbers on the economy, Biden pollster John Anzalone argued. Months of continued economic uncertainty, even as some indicators have improved, may also be pulling voters in Biden’s direction on the issue, he said.
In a CNN poll released last week, 49% of registered voters said they trusted Trump more on the economy while 48% said they trusted Biden more. In May, Trump led 54% to 42%. A Quinnipiac University poll released last week found the two candidates tied at 48% on who voters would trust more on the economy. In June, Trump was up by 5 points on the same question. A CBS News/YouGov national poll released over the weekend also had Trump leading by just 1 point, 45% to 44%, with registered voters who were asked which candidate would do a better job handling the economy.Not every poll is quite so good for Biden. A Quinnipiac poll of Florida has Trump leading by 13 points, 55% to 42%, on the economy, even as Biden leads overall 48% to 45%.
“He just needs to keep pounding on the message,” said Ohio Representative Tim Ryan, a Democrat. “He’s right on point and just needs to get the message to the low-information voter that Joe Biden understands the economic challenges that you’re facing and Donald Trump just keeps talking about the stock market.”But Biden’s team is confident about its trajectory. Trump “has lost any advantage of being this business guy who can fix it. He’s now being judged on his job as president,” Anzalone said. “And his job ratings are upside down.”

170,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 08, 2020 02:05PM ET</span>","Investors cheer as GM, Nikola join forces to build electric trucks","By Rachit Vats and Ben Klayman
(Reuters) - General Motors Co (N:GM) and electric truck startup  Nikola Corp  (O:NKLA) will join forces to build electric pickup trucks and fuel cell commercial trucks to take on Tesla Inc (O:TSLA), in a deal that lifted shares in both companies on Tuesday.
As part of a multi-part, multibillion-dollar deal, GM received an 11% stake in Nikola, valued at about $2 billion. In return for the Nikola shares, GM will supply Nikola with batteries, a chassis architecture, fuel cell systems and a factory to build the startup's proposed Nikola Badger pickup. GM will also supply fuel cell technology for Nikola's planned Class 7 and 8 commercial tractor-trailers.
Shares of Nikola soared more than 48% to $52.94 after GM's investment, giving GM a paper gain of more than $500 million on its investment. GM said it expects to realize a total of $4 billion in value from the deal, including $700 million for building the Badger at one of its factories, and the value of regulatory credits for a zero emission vehicle.
GM Chief Executive Mary Barra also said the Detroit company may supply other companies with its Ultium electric battery and hydrogen fuel cell technologies.
""We are certainly open to consider additional deals as it relates to both Ultium and the fuel cell Hydrotec technology,"" she told reporters on a conference call. 
The alliance with Nikola is the second major deal in a week for GM and highlights the pressures faced by the auto industry to share costs to meet demands for cleaner vehicles. Last week GM announced a North American alliance with Japan's Honda Motor Co (T:7267).
The agreements also signal the urgency of Barra's efforts to convince investors that GM can slash costs in its traditional, internal combustion business and develop a profitable, viable electric vehicle business.
Shares of GM, which have been stuck for months at levels below $33 a share, the price of the 2010, post-bankruptcy public offering, rose about 10% to that price in afternoon trading.
GM will receive $2 billion in newly issued Nikola stock and will get the right to nominate one director to the electric truck maker's board. I
GM's first electric pickup truck, the GMC Hummer, is due in late 2021. GM will build the electric and fuel cell versions of the Nikola Badger truck and the companies expect production by the end of 2022. 
Nikola will buy GM's fuel cell systems for its Class 7 and Class 8 semi trucks. That deal runs for four years after start of production of those vehicles at a Nikola plant outside Phoenix and is exclusive except for the European market.
The companies did not say where the Nikola pickup would be built by GM. Most of GM's EVs will be built at its Detroit-Hamtramck plant.
Nikola said it expects to save $4 billion in battery and powertrain costs over 10 years and over $1 billion in engineering and validation costs.
Nikola CEO Trevor Milton said Tuesday that avoiding the cost of building a pickup truck assembly plant and developing a truck chassis was ""a big deal for us."" Nikola's Badger will now share major components under the skin - and a supply chain - with the GMC Hummer.
""We are going to swap out our platform for theirs,"" Milton said.
GM under the deal also will receive EV credits, an important factor as most of GM's vehicles are still gasoline-powered. 
Barra said the companies were introduced to each other by former GM vice chairman Steve Girsky, who took Nikola public through a reverse merger with his special purpose acquisition company earlier this year. Girsky is on the Nikola board. 
The Nikola truck will compete with Tesla's Cybertruck, as well as electric pickups planned by startup Rivian,  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) and GM itself.
Nikola claims the Badger will have a range of 600 miles, compared with the Cycbertruck's claimed range of more than 500 miles. The Cybertruck and other electric pickups have not launched yet.
Last year, GM failed to reach a deal with Rivian, which then sold a stake to Ford.

 CNH Industrial  (MI:CNHI) has a 7.11% stake in Nikola, through its truck unit IVECO. IVECO and Nikola are in a partnership to produce electric and hydrogen trucks.

(Reuters) - The Nasdaq tumbled on Tuesday as a sell-off in high-flying technology stocks extended to a third straight day, while Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) tracked its worst day in nearly six months after investors were caught off guard by the stock being left out of the S&P 500.
All eleven major S&P sectors were down, with declines worsening after news on Friday that SoftBank made significant option purchases during the run-up in U.S. stocks.
Energy, financial and information technology stocks were among the biggest decliners. 
""To see a period of carnage is reasonable, considering the massive run up that we have experienced since the early part of the year,"" said Eric Schiffer, chief executive officer of private equity firm Patriarch Organization in Beverly Hills, California.
""We'll need some time to see whether this is a fundamental shift versus a technical on exhibit, because if it is a shift to fundamentals, that is not a position where you're going to want to necessarily buy a dip.""
Media reports of SoftBank's option purchases also reminded investors that market makers might have billions of dollars worth of long positions as hedges against options trades, which will have to be sold as prices fall.
""If you bought a lot of call options in the second quarter, you're doing very well, but that creates a problem for later when you need to unwind these positions,"" said Ken Peng, Citi Private Bank's head of Asia Investment Strategy.
Wall Street's tech-and-stimulus-led rally halted last week with the Nasdaq falling as much as 9.9% from its record closing high as investors booked profits after a run that boosted the index about 70% from its pandemic-lows.

Tesla plunged another 15.5% to a three-week low as the electric-car maker was excluded from a group of companies being added to the S&P 500. Investors had widely expected its inclusion after a blockbuster quarterly earnings report in July. Up to Friday's close, the stock had surged about 400% this year.
At 12:28 p.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 414.98 points, or 1.48%, at 27,718.33, the S&P 500 was down 64.73 points, or 1.89%, at 3,362.23, and the Nasdaq Composite was down 305.36 points, or 2.70%, at 11,007.77.
JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co fell 3% after a report it was probing employees who were allegedly involved in the misuse of funds intended for COVID-19 relief. The wider banks index lost 3.1%, also tracking Treasury yields. 
Energy stocks slumped 3% as oil prices dove after Saudi Arabia cut its October selling prices. 
Value-linked stocks fell 1.4%, but outperformed a 2.2% decline in the growth-link index. Wall Street's fear gauge climbed for the third time in four sessions.
Fears over potential U.S. sanctions against China's biggest chipmaker SMIC hit domestic suppliers, with Applied Materials Inc (NASDAQ:AMAT),  Lam Research Corp  (NASDAQ:LRCX) and KLA Corp dropping between 6.3% and 8.3%.
General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) jumped 10.9% after it acquired an 11% stake worth $2 billion in U.S. electric-truck maker Nikola Corp. The truck maker's shares surged 44.2%.
U.S. President Donald Trump and Democratic rival Joe Biden are set to visit battleground states this week as some opinion polls show the race tightening with less than 60 days to go until the Nov. 3 election.
Declining issues outnumbered advancers more than 3-to-1 on the NYSE and 1.94-to-1 on the Nasdaq.

The S&P index recorded no new 52-week high and two new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 23 new highs and 41 new lows.

(Reuters) - Oilfield job losses from the COVID-19 pandemic topped 100,000 in the United States in August, according to a report released on Tuesday by trade group Petroleum Equipment & Services Association (PESA), even though some idled drilling projects have resumed. 
There was 121,000 oilfield jobs lost in the last 12 months, the report said, with employment in the U.S. sector at its lowest level since March 2017. The bulk of those job losses, 103,420, have come since the pandemic began, the report said. 
U.S. crude futures on Tuesday were trading about $37 a barrel, below the cost of production for many U.S. producers. Shale production was 7.6 million barrels per day (bpd) in August, down from 9.2 million bpd in February, before the pandemic crushed fuel demand, according to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration.
“The situation in 2020 is very different than it was in 2015-2016,"" said Leslie Beyer, president of PESA, when a price war cut into U.S. output. 
""The most important thing we can do for the oilfield services sector and our economy is get control of the pandemic and begin a responsible reopening of the world’s economies,"" she said.
Despite the bleak figures, the rate of energy job losses is slowing, the report found, with only 2,600 jobs lost last month, the lowest since the pandemic began in March. 
""We’re encouraged by the slowing job losses and increased production, but we’re cautious due to uncertainty around continued pandemic effects on the economic recovery. We know demand will return, but it will be slow,"" said Beyer.
The bulk of the cuts have been in Texas, where some 59,000 workers lost their jobs this year, followed by Louisiana with 10,200 job losses and Oklahoma with 9,200. 

Some 180,000 oilfield service jobs were supported by loans from the Paycheck Protection Program that was a safety net for businesses, PESA's analysis found.

The bank said it had found cases of customers ""misusing Paycheck Protection Program loans, unemployment benefits and other government programs,"" according to the memo, which was verified by a bank spokeswoman.
""Some employees have fallen short, too,"" according to the memo, which was sent to staff by the bank's top operating committee. ""We are doing all we can to identify those instances, and cooperate with law enforcement where appropriate.""
U.S. lawmakers and independent watchdogs have in recent weeks warned of widespread abuse and fraud in the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), where banks dished out government funds to small business borrowers hurt by the coronavirus pandemic. 
Last week, a key Congressional panel warned it identified tens of thousands of loans worth billions of dollars that may have been subject to fraud, waste and abuse in the $659 billion taxpayer-funded program, including by companies that were ineligible under the rules or that broke the rules by taking more than one loan.
JPMorgan said in May that it had loaned around $30 billion to some 240,000 businesses under PPP. 
The Small Business Administration, which administered the PPP program, has also warned of ""strong indicators of widespread potential fraud"" in its economic disaster loan program.

The U.S. Justice Department has brought multiple criminal actions against individuals who stole PPP loans to fund lavish lifestyles.

174,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 08, 2020 12:15PM ET</span>",Ford's incoming CEO wants the U.S. automaker to run like a Deere,"By Ben Klayman
DETROIT (Reuters) - From the moment he was named chief operating officer and heir apparent to the top spot at Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co in February, Jim Farley has touted the growth potential of its commercial vehicles.
But it's not just more trucks and vans that Farley wants to sell. As Farley prepares to takes over as chief executive on Oct. 1, he is betting Ford can transform its commercial vehicle business to generate recurring revenue through sales of services that take advantage of the software, data and connectivity in its F-Series pickup truck and Transit vans.
""Think of it as a second F-150,"" Farley told Reuters, referring to the U.S. automaker's lucrative full-size truck business that generates $50 billion in annual revenue. ""We have the F-150 everyone loves. There's this other business out here that's huge.""
""Think of the data being more powerful than the fuel economy of the vehicle,"" he added.
Automakers like Ford have talked for a long time about generating post-sale revenue from connected vehicles, but they have struggled to deliver. As a result, Ford has been abandoned by growth-oriented investors, despite its lucrative F-series franchise. 
Ford now is trying to show it can grow, and build a competitive moat around its commercial vehicle business before electric car leader Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc, other startups and larger technology players like Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) enter those markets. 
The U.S. market alone last year accounted for more than $58 billion in sales of commercial trucks and vans, everything from Class-1 regular pickups to Class-7 heavy-duty trucks like the Ford F-750, according to ACT Research.
Farley is counting on a new hire to help build data-generated revenue from Ford's commercial vehicle business: Alex Purdy, former head of agricultural equipment maker Deere (NYSE:DE) & Co's Silicon Valley office.
At Deere, Purdy led efforts to deliver artificial intelligence (AI) on the farm through smart equipment and founded John Deere Labs to help build a ""sticky"" relationship with customers. Deere's aftermarket parts and services business accounted for about 15% to 20% of $35 billion in sales last year. 
In his first interview since his May hiring to lead Ford's commercial vehicle connectivity business, Purdy said he ""helped transition an industrial goods business that thought about metal bending into a service business."" 
Among the products developed by Deere while Purdy worked there were the ExactEmerge planter that offers improved seed spacing at higher speeds, freeing up workers for other jobs; and the See and Spray distribution system that will use smart cameras to distinguish between healthy and unhealthy crops, allowing for reduced use of herbicides when it's introduced next year.
Purdy, a 35-year-old former investment banker and consultant, grew up on a farm in Okotoks, outside Calgary, Canada, and describes himself as ""passionate about smart connected vehicles, automotive, AI."" 
Ford is the leading commercial vehicle brand in the United States and Europe - with shares of 40% and almost 15%, respectively - thanks to the F-Series trucks as well as its Transit vans.
""Ford is the 900-pound gorilla in the commercial business,"" said Rhett Ricart, a big Ford commercial vehicle dealer in Columbus, Ohio. ""They've always had this competitive advantage.""
Earlier this year, Ricart moved into a new 116,000-square-foot commercial truck facility that dwarfs the old 18,000-square-foot building, and said he looks forward to working with Ford as they roll out additional connected services.
Purdy and other Ford officials want Ford's commercial customers to regularly pay for services, creating a revenue stream that flows throughout the vehicle's life, beyond a one-time transaction every few years. 
Ford officials talk about products as such geolocation services to optimize route planning and reduce gasoline usage, predictive products that allow for faster oil changes and fleet management operations.
""When you measure time as a commodity like money, there are lots of those kinds of experiences that customers are willing to pay for because they're in the productivity business,"" Farley said. 
The goal for Ford is to lower the total cost of ownership for its commercial customers; raise productivity, such as increased package delivery; and reduce downtime for customer vehicles, said Ted Cannis, head of Ford's North American commercial vehicle business. 
""So now the total addressable market, instead of being just new-vehicle sales is the entire process - parts, service, accessories, connected services,"" he said.
Hans Schep, head of Ford's European commercial vehicle business, said the shift in focus is playing out in meetings on quality. Five years ago, those meetings were about how to reduce Ford's warranty costs, he said. Now, the discussions are about how to keep its customers' vehicles on the road.
Ford's push in commercial vehicles will work hand-in-hand with the push to electrify its vehicles, including the F-150 and Transit.

As part of the efforts, Ford and Germany's Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p) said in June they would make up to 8 million units of mid-sized pickup trucks and commercial vans over the lifecycle of the vehicles, starting in 2022. Farley believes the automakers' alliance will allow Ford to use their combined scale to build its European commercial vehicle business even more.

""This is the result of the typical prisoner's dilemma: for fear of getting short shrift, an agreement is then reached that is disadvantageous for both sides but the 'devil may care' approach demonstrated by the British government does not exactly help to instil confidence.""

“While I certainly get that their revenues and earnings growth projections are in jeopardy, the price can only go down so much before it looks like a great value,” said Don Calcagni, chief investment officer of Mercer Advisors. “Especially as we start to come out of Covid and the economy grows again, I think you’ll start to see those value stocks pivot quite nicely.”
 State Street  (NYSE:STT) Global Advisors launched its SPDR MSCI World Value UCITS ETF on Tuesday.

Disney+ costs $7 a month, and it costs an additional $30 to watch Mulan, which has generated criticism for filming in Xinjiang, where China has been accused of human rights abuses of more than 1 million Uighur Muslims, according to Hollywood Reporter. The star of the film, Chinese-American actress Liu Yifei, has also been the subject of controversy for commenting last year on social media that she supports the Hong Kong police force's crackdown on the pro-democracy movement.    
 Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) also upgraded the company and its streaming potential. Disney has ""the most clear path to successfully transitioning its general entertainment programming and content production businesses into a globally scaled, vertically integrated streaming entertainment leader,"" Deutsche analysts Bryan Kraft wrote in a note, MarketWatch reported. 
Kraft cited impressive subscriber results, as well as the decision to shut down some of its traditional networks in international markets, including the UK. He raised his price target on the stock to $163 from $128.  
Offline, Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS) World reached its capacity limits over the Labor Day weekend for the first time since reopening, Forbes reported, citing Orlando's News 6 and the Associated Press. Disney's theme parks will reduce operating hours after this weekend.

181,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 08, 2020 10:40AM ET</span>","Indonesia adds Twitter, Zoom to tech companies that must pay 10% VAT","JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesia on Tuesday added 12 more companies, including social media firm Twitter (N:TWTR) and video-conferencing site Zoom (O:ZM), to a list of internet-based businesses that must pay a 10% value-added tax on sales.
In July Indonesia had already announced that Alphabet Inc's (O:GOOGL) Google Asia Pacific, Netflix (O:NFLX) and Facebook (O:FB) among other tech companies would be liable to VAT.
Governments globally are seeking to ensure that internet-based tech giants are paying their fair share of taxes. Indonesia's moves come amid a shift to more online business with increased remote working during the coronavirus and as the pandemic has hit government finances.
Among companies named on Tuesday were business networking site LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) Singapore, two units of Twitter (N:TWTR), Skype Communications,  Zoom Video Communications  (O:ZM), antivirus provider McAfee Ireland, and Microsoft Ireland Operations (O:MSFT).
The Indonesian tax office also put game developer Mojang AB, streaming platforms Novi Digital Entertainment and PCCW Vuclip (Singapore) on the list, as well as digital marketplaces Jingdong Indonesia Pertama and Shopee International Indonesia.
The companies must start charging VAT to advertisers and other customers from Oct. 1.
The companies were not immediately available to comment. 
Under rules introduced earlier this year, non-resident foreign firms that generate annual sales of at least 600 million rupiah ($40,650) for digital products and services in Indonesia from at least 12,000 users are required to pay the VAT.
Indonesia, the world's fourth most populous country with a population of nearly 270 million, is experiencing a boom in its digital economy which is expected to reach $130 billion by 2025, a study by Google, Temasek Holdings and Bain & Company predicts.

Investing.com --  Foot Locker  (NYSE:FL) rose after Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) initiated coverage with a buy.
Shares rose 1% on Tuesday amid a broader market sell-off.
Foot Locker is competitively positioned with enduring tailwinds, Goldman said, according to Seeking Alpha. Foot Locker is strategically important to key vendors, has strong category dynamics and products cycles, as well as market share consolidation opportunities, the bank said. ""While we recognize potential for near-term volatility given an uncertain consumer recovery path associated with Covid-19, we believe Foot Locker's solid balance sheet, net cash position, and national footprint positions the share for outperformance,"" according to Goldman Sachs.  
Last month, Foot Locker reported earnings per share of 71 cents compared to the expected 32 cents on sales of $2.08 billion compared to the expected $1.83 billion. Results beat forecasts even after Foot Locker had earlier disclosed that sales in the second quarter were strong thanks to stimulus spending. Comparable-store sales rose 18%. The company reinstated its quarterly dividend program based on its strong liquidity and stable cash outlook. 
Shares have seven buy ratings, eight holds and no sells.

183,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 08, 2020 10:09AM ET</span>",McConnell Aims for Vote on Senate Republican Stimulus This Week,"(Bloomberg) -- Senate Republicans said Tuesday that they will introduce and set up a floor vote on a slimmed-down virus stimulus bill in an effort to break a month-long impasse on aid for the U.S. economy.
The bill, expected to feature some of the aspects of a $1 trillion proposal put forth by Republicans a month ago, is expected to cost $500 billion to $700 billion.
“The Senate Republican majority is introducing a new targeted proposal, focused on some of the very most urgent health-care, education and economic issues. It does not contain every idea our party likes,” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said in a statement. “I will be moving immediately today to set up a floor vote as soon as this week.”
Senate Democrats are expected to block the bill, which would need 60 votes to pass under Senate filibuster rules.
Even so, White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, who has talked with a handful of moderate Democrats in recent weeks, said Tuesday he was optimistic public pressure would push lawmakers into a compromise in the coming two weeks. He said the smaller package could serve as a “foundation” for further Covid-19 relief.
Meadows’s Hope
“There is a groundswell of support among rank-and-file Democrats and Republicans to suggest that there is some kind of compromise,” Meadows said in an interview with Fox Business News.
An earlier draft of the Republican bill would have provided a $300-per-week unemployment benefit enhancement, $105 billion for schools, a $10 billion grant to the U.S. Postal Service, funding for the Paycheck Protection Program for small businesses, $45 billion to the Department of Health and Human Services for vaccines and testing needs, and liability protections for employers.
It didn’t include another round of $1,200 checks to individuals -- something that President Donald Trump wants -- or any aid to state and local governments, a key demand of Democrats.
“The stumbling block is aid to state and local governments,” Meadows said Tuesday, reiterating his opposition to the Democrats’ proposal for almost $1 trillion in aid for regional authorities that have seen their revenues devastated by the Covid-19 crisis.
McConnell worked for weeks to get most of his 53 Republicans on board with the plan in the face of opposition from deficit hawks concerned about adding to this year’s $3.3 trillion budget deficit. His move comes as talks on a stimulus package between the White House and Democrats continue to be an impasse.
The two sides have been more than $1 trillion apart since negotiations broke off Aug. 7.

The company will join tech giants and other consumer companies, including PepsiCo Inc (O:PEP) which switched exchanges in 2017.
Separately, JAB Holding Co, Keurig's majority owner, will redistribute about 76 million shares, or 5.4%, in the coffee and beverage company to its minority partners, investment banker Byron Trott's BDT Capital Partners and Dallas-based Quadrant Capital Advisors.
Keurig's Chief Executive Officer Bob Gamgort said JAB's move would push the beverage maker to ""becoming a widely-held company.""
Family-owned JAB Holding combined its Keurig coffee business and the publicly-traded soft drinks company to create Keurig Dr Pepper, which helped the conglomerate expand into the soft-drinks business.
Following the redistribution, JAB, which currently owns about a half of Keurig's public float through Maple Holdings BV, will own 44% of Keurig.
 Mondelez International Inc  (O:MDLZ) will continue to own 12% and the public float will increase to 44%, including shares held directly by the minority partners, the Dr Pepper soda maker said.
Keurig, which currently trades on NYSE, has a market capitalization of about $42 billion according to IBES data from Refinitiv. It will retain the ""KDP"" ticker with trading on the Nasdaq expected to begin on September 21.

""Nokia's performance has not met our expectations in recent times and of course that is a disappointment, but we look at this over the long run,"" Antti Makinen, CEO of Solidium, the Finnish government's investment firm, told Reuters. 
""The previous management had become a burden,"" he added. 
Pekka Lundmark, the new CEO, took over from Rajeev Suri in August, a month earlier than planned. Under Suri, Nokia last year slashed its profit outlook and halted dividend payouts, after product missteps that hurt its 5G ambitions and knocked more than a fifth off its market value. 
""We believe the (CEO) exchange alone will have a good effect,"" Makinen said. ""We have high expectations of Nokia and the new management that the potential we see in it will be realised."" 
A Nokia spokeswoman declined to comment. 
Nokia in May also got a new chairwoman in Sari Baldauf, one of the most high-profile female executives in the global telecoms industry. She took over from Risto Siilasmaa who chaired the Finnish firm for eight years. 
Solidium, which became an investor in Nokia in 2018 after buying a 3.3% stake, now owns more than 5%. 
Rival Ericsson (BS:ERICAs), which also replaced much of its top management in 2016, has been able to capitalise on the 5G rollout faster. Both firms have also benefited from U.S. moves move to ban China's Huawei from bidding for telecom contracts. 

Nokia's financial potential had not been realised as a merger with Alcatel-Lucent (PA:ALUA) took long time and 5G emerged more quickly than operators and companies expected, Makinen said ""We don't believe it will remain this way in the long run ... Nokia has a good roadmap to catch up,"" he added.

Investing.com -- The sharp sell-off in technology stocks that began at the end of last week gathered pace as U.S. markets reopened in gloomy fashion after the long Labor Day weekend.
The Nasdaq Composite, which has hit a series of new record highs over recent weeks, fell 285 points, or 2.5%, by 10 AM ET (1400 GMT) in what appeared to be an overdue correction. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average were dragged lower, but to a lesser extent. The Dow fell 472 points or 1.7% to 27,661 points and the S&P 500 fell 1.8%.
Leading the losers was Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock, which fell 15% after being hit by a combination of two factors. The market struggled to digest a $5 billion stock offering placed at the end of last week, while there was also widespread disappointment at the refusal of Standard & Poor's to include it in the S&P 500 index in its most recent review. Much of Tesla's 160% rise since June had been down to speculation that some of the trillions of dollars invested in S&P tracking funds would have to be reallocated to Tesla as it broke into the index. 
Other gigacap stocks that had rallied strongly in recent weeks also saw some sharp profit-taking. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock fell 5.7%, while Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) stock fell 3.6%, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) stock fell 3.5% while Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock fell 4.4%,  All of them are still well above their pre-pandemic levels, however.
Other stocks that had benefited most from pandemic-driven trades also fell heavily. Zoom Video (NASDAQ:ZM) stock fell 4.4%, while  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) stock fell 11% as unease spread about the high degree of insider sales at the company in the last three months. In that time - which has also seen the company conduct a major secondary offering - insiders have sold over 12 million shares and bought only 50,000. The unease was also stoked by news of a government investigation into whether Moderna had filed the patent applications for its Covid-19 and Zika vaccines correctly. 
More positively, electric truck-maker Nikola (NASDAQ:NKLA) rose 26% after General Motors agreed to take a $2 billion equity stake in the company. GM (NYSE:GM) stock also rose 5.6% on perceptions of a shrewd acquisition. The two companies will team up to make Nikola's Badger pickup truck together, with production expected to start by the end of 2022. That truck will compete with Tesla's Cybertruck, as well as electric pickups planned by startup Rivian and Ford Motor (NYSE:F).
Other notable outperformers included Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) stock, which rose 0.8% after the company reported a leap in new subscribers for its streaming channel Disney+ as it chose to distribute its new blockbuster Mulan exclusively through that channel. 
Elsewhere, fear returned to the oil and gas sector as Crude Oil Futures slumped on concerns about the stalling recovery in global oil demand.  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) stock,  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) stock and ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) stock all fell nearly 4% to five-month lows.

Finance Minister Roberto Gualtieri has signed off on a draft decree to authorize the Treasury to sell its holdings in the rescued bank, people with knowledge of the matter said. The document, seen by Bloomberg, also says a disposal may be carried out in multiple stages. A tender may involve depositors, bank employees and institutional investors, according to the draft.
Monte Paschi, founded in 1472, is 68% owned by the Italian state after a recapitalization in 2017. The government can begin a sale or merger process after the bank completes a complex transaction that would allow it to move more than 8 billion euros ($9.4 billion) of soured debt to state-owned asset manager Amco, according to the document.
The Finance Minister’s office declined to comment.
The draft is still under review by Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte and could be amended further before it receives approval from the cabinet.
Undermined by souring loans and derivatives deals that backfired, the bank received a 5.4 billion-euro bailout from the government. Since then, it has struggled to deliver consistent profits given limited room for maneuver under terms demanded by the European Union in return for supporting the aid plan. The state’s stake is worth about 1.1 billion euros at the current share price.
As part of the bailout accord with the European Commission, Italy agreed to exit the bank by the end of next year. Italian government officials including Gualtieri have recently said they expect to meet that deadline.
Reuters previously reported that the finance minister approved the draft.

STOCKHOLM/BENGALURU/LONDON (Reuters) - Swedish payments firm Klarna is in talks with investors for a new round of funding which would value it at more than $10 billion, three sources said, as it attempts to expand its business in the United States.
At that valuation, Klarna, whose service allows shoppers to buy online through its merchant partners and settle their dues in instalments using its ""buy now, pay later"" (BNPL), would nearly double its previous peak of $5.5 billion in August 2019. 
But the privately-owned Swedish company will still be valued at less than its rival, Australia's AfterPay (AX:APT), which has a market capitalisation of about $15 billion.
Klarna plans to raise just over $500 million from a mix of old and new investors, two of the sources told Reuters, adding that a deal will likely be announced in the coming days.
A spokeswoman for Klarna, which was founded in 2005 and already counts Sequoia Capital, Bestseller, Dragoneer and Commonwealth Bank of Australia (OTC:CMWAY) among its largest investors, declined to comment on its plans.
With about 85 million customers and 235,000 merchant partners, Klarna has been expanding in the U.S. and Britain.
""BNPL"" companies have seen rapid growth as customers turned to online shopping during coronavirus lockdowns.
Klarna's gross merchandise volume (GMV) - the value of transactions made using its payment platform - has risen to $22 billion in the first half of the year. 
It said https://fr.reuters.com/article/klarna-results-idCNL4N2FS20T last month that the U.S. will soon become its largest market, where it will also file for an initial public offering (IPO) within the next two years. 

Klarna's latest funding round is likely be its last before a potential IPO, one source said, adding that the firm is likely to start talks with investment banks to help with preparations for a listing over the coming months.

MILAN/TOKYO (Reuters) - World shares struggled to stabilise on Tuesday as doubts about a recovery in tech stocks lingered after last week's rout, while the dollar steadied as investors pondered whether policy signals from the European Central Bank this week could weaken the euro. 
Fresh tensions between Washington and Beijing after U.S. President Donald Trump again raised the idea of decoupling the U.S. and Chinese economies appeared to have little impact.
""I think the market will shrug this off as electioneering but may find the lining up of technology stock sellers harder to process as the U.S. market returns from a holiday yesterday,"" said Chris Bailey, European Strategist at Raymond James. 
World shares (MIWD00000PUS) fell 0.1% by 0835 GMT following gains in Asia overnight and a negative start in Europe, where fresh pressure on tech stocks dragged the STOXX 600 (STOXX) benchmark down 0.9% following strong gains on Monday. 
After U.S. markets were shut on Monday for Labor Day, S&P 500 futures  fell 0.1%, reversing gains made in Asian hours, while futures in tech-heavy Nasdaq  fell 1.3% after having lost more than 6% late last week.
While many market players were unable to pinpoint a single trigger for the Nasdaq's sudden plunge, valuations have been stretched given its sharp 75% gain from a bottom hit in March.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan (MIAPJ0000PUS) rose 0.4% and Japan's Nikkei ended up 0.8% (N225). China's blue-chip index (CSI300) and Hong Kong's Hang Seng (HSI) meanwhile gained 0.5% and 0.2% respectively, both erasing early losses made after Trump's remarks.
The newly launched Hang Seng tech index (HSTECH) fell 1.4%.
Trump's remarks followed the possible U.S. blacklisting of China's largest chip maker, Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp (SMIC), which has hit many Chinese tech firms listed onshore and offshore. 
DOLLAR STEADY, POUND HIT
In foreign exchange markets, the dollar was slightly stronger against a basket of currencies (=USD) at 93.115 and firmed marginally against the euro (EUR=EBS) at $1.1816 with the main focus on this week's ECB policy meeting.
Most analysts do not expect a change in the central bank's policy stance but are looking at its inflation forecasts and whether it seems concerned by the euro's strength. 
""Rangebound trading will likely remain predominant until Thursday when the ECB meets,"" UniCredit analysts said in a note.
Sterling fell to a two-week low against the dollar after the European Union told Britain on Monday there would be no trade deal if London tries to override the Brexit divorce deal it signed in January. 
The pound slipped more 0.3% at $1.3135  while against the euro (EURGBP=D3) it touched 0.90 pence, also a two-week low. 
Gold prices softened on Tuesday, although rising doubts over the economic recovery from the COVID-19 slump limited losses. Spot gold was little changed at $1,9283.87 per ounce.
Oil fell below $42 a barrel, its fifth session of decline, pressured by concerns that a recovery in demand could weaken as coronavirus infections flare up around the world.
U.S. crude futures fell 3.3% to $38.46 per barrel. 

The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield stood at 0.709%, off a five-month low of 0.504% touched in August.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are set to open lower Tuesday, with the tech sector seen continuing last week’s rout as investors reevaluate their stance after recent strong gains.  
At 7:10 AM ET (1110 GMT),S&P 500 Futures traded 21 points, or 0.6%, lower, the Dow Futures contract fell 20 points, or 0.1%, while Nasdaq 100 Futures underperformed, dropping 230 points, or 2%. 
The major averages all hit two week lows last week. That said, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite had its worst week since March due to doubts over positioning and stretched valuations. These worries were exacerbated on Friday when the Financial Times reported that options trading by Japan’s Softbank (OTC:SFTBY) had inflated these stocks.
Still, the question remains whether this selloff signifies anything more than a correction after the tech sector’s sharp runup throughout the Covid-19 pandemic.
Technology stocks remain investors’ best bet and can continue driving returns in the current bull market, according to Peter Oppenheimer, Goldman Sachs’s chief global equity strategist, in a research note Monday.
Goldman maintained its overweight recommendation in tech stocks in every region thanks to the sector’s strong cash generation, earnings and stable balance sheets.
With this all in mind, the focus will remain on the tech sector Tuesday, with the likes of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) all sharply lower in premarket trade.
Meanwhile, President Donald Trump continued to use China as a punchbag, promising a “decoupling” of the U.S. economy from the Chinese one if he is re-elected in November.
The data slate is largely empty Tuesday, but interest will soon turn to Friday's inflation figures for August. These are expected to show core CPI rising 0.2% month-on-month and 1.6% on a year-over-year  basis, still clearly below the 2% level the Federal Reserve is now aiming for as an average.
Meanwhile, lawmakers are returning to Washington after the August recess facing the prospect of a government shutdown, and having to decide whether to approve an elusive fifth coronavirus stimulus package.
Oil prices dropped Tuesday, falling to their lowest in 10 weeks, with the WTI contract suffering the bulk of the selling after the U.S. Labor Day long weekend, which marks the end of the peak U.S. driving season.
U.S. crude futures traded 5.2% lower at $37.70 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract fell 3.1% to $40.73. 
Elsewhere, gold futures fell 0.6% to $1,923.35/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% lower at $1.1802.

193,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 08, 2020 06:40AM ET</span>","U.S., European COVID vaccine developers make pledge to uphold testing rigour","By Ludwig Burger and Patricia Weiss
FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Nine leading U.S. and European vaccine developers pledged on Tuesday to uphold the scientific standards that their experimental immunisations will be held against, amid a hurried global race to contain the pandemic.
The companies, including  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE), GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE:GSK) and AstraZeneca (NYSE:AZN), in a joint statement made a ""historic pledge... to uphold the integrity of the scientific process as they work towards potential global regulatory filings and approvals of the first COVID-19 vaccines"".
The unusual move to promise to play by well-established rules underlines a highly politicised debate over what action is needed to quickly rein in the spread of the deadly disease and to jumpstart global business and trade.
The head of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said last month that the normal approval process may be bypassed for a COVID-19 vaccine as long as officials were convinced the benefits outweigh the risks, prompting a call for caution from the World Health Organisation.
Developers globally have yet to produce large-scale trial data showing actual infections in participants, yet Russia granted approval to a COVID-19 vaccine last month, prompting some Western experts to criticize a lack of testing.
The head of China's Sinovac Biotech said most of its employees and their families have already taken an experimental vaccine developed by the Chinese firm under the country's emergency-use programme.
""We want it to be known that also in the current situation we are not willing to compromise safety and efficacy,"" said co-signatory Ugur Sahin, the chief executive of Pfizer's German partner BioNTech.
""Apart from the pressure and the hope for a vaccine to be available as fast as possible, there is also a lot of uncertainty among people that some development steps may be omitted here,"" he added. 
BioNTech and Pfizer have raised the prospect of unveiling pivotal trial data in October, potentially placing it at the centre of bitter U.S. presidential politics ahead of the Nov. 3 election.
According to the statement, the nine companies pledge to follow established guidance from expert regulatory authorities such as the FDA. 
Among other hurdles, approval must be based on large, diverse clinical trials with comparative groups that do not receive the vaccine in question. Participants and those working on the trial must not know which group they belong to, according to the pledge.
BioNTech's Sahin added there must be statistical certainty of 95%, in some cases higher, that a positive reading on efficacy does not just come from random variations but reflects the underlying workings of the compound.
The list of co-signatories is completed by Johnson & Johnson, Merck & Co,  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA),  Novavax  (NASDAQ:NVAX) and  Sanofi  (NASDAQ:SNY). 
Sahin said inclusion in the pledge broadly reflected a significant vaccines market share or a leading position in coronavirus vaccine development. 
The frenetic development race has intensified safety concerns about an inoculation, polls have shown.

Western regulators have stressed they would not cut corners but rather prioritise the review workload and allow for development steps in parallel that would normally be handled consecutively.

CHICAGO (Reuters) - Spooked by COVID-19, Martha Jones of Southern Kentucky will not let her three children trick-or-treat this year. Instead, she is transforming her sun deck into a mini-haunted house and setting up games, a grill and a bonfire in her backyard. 
""It'll give the children something to be excited about without going door-to-door for candy,"" said Jones, a 31-year-old chocolatier. 
Hundreds of miles away in the New York City borough of Brooklyn, 43-year-old musician Paul Lee is figuring out how to make sure his two kids can safely go trick-or-treating - the Halloween custom in some countries of children wearing costumes and going from house to house, asking for candy with the phrase ""Trick or treat.""
In the weeks leading up to the Oct. 31 event, Jones and Lee will see very different ads on social media and websites from candy maker  Hershey Co  (N:HSY), based on where they live, how likely they are to be on lockdown, and what Halloween activities they have been searching for online. This is part of a new marketing strategy in partnership with Alphabet Inc's (O:GOOGL) Google, Hershey executives told Reuters. 
Hershey will tailor digital ads to households using search data provided by Google to overcome fresh challenges that threaten to derail this year’s Halloween. 
The Pennsylvania-based candymaker struck a deal with Google last month for access to data showing whether people are more or less likely to go outside based on what they search for. For instance, a person who sought out business hours for nearby stores or vacation ideas suggests the likelihood to go outside.
So Jones and other people staying home for the holiday could see videos and clips on social media of people eating KitKats and Reese's Peanut Butter Cups under twinkly lights in their backyards or living rooms. In places where people are more inclined to venture out, they might see ads of mask-clad kids and adults going door-to-door for candy. 
""On a weekly basis, we can change how we're talking to consumers based on what we're seeing geographically,"" Phil Stanley, Hershey's chief sales officer, said in an interview in August. 
The move is one of many strategic changes to marketing and logistics that U.S. candy companies are making ahead of Halloween, after a disappointing Easter.
Halloween is typically the candy industry's biggest holiday season by sales, followed by the periods around Christmas, Easter and Valentine's Day. For Hershey, Halloween represents a tenth of its roughly $8 billion in annual sales.
This year, anticipating a sharp increase in online sales and fewer trick-or-treaters, Hershey,  Mondelez International Inc  (O:MDLZ) and their rivals are shrinking candy packs, spending more on digital marketing, setting up Halloween store displays earlier in the year, and keeping aside more e-commerce inventory for retailers trying to make up for lost brick-and-mortar sales. 
Hershey, which relies on trick-or-treating for about half of its Halloween sales, told Reuters it plans to increase digital media spending on Halloween by 160% versus last year, targeting mainly e-commerce shoppers. Mondelez, which makes Sour Patch Kids chewy candies, said it too plans to spend more this Halloween on social and digital media.
NEIGHBORHOOD WATCH
Only about one-third of U.S. parents plan on sending their kids trick-or-treating this year, according to Matt Voda, CEO of marketing analytics firm OptiMine Software. ""So that's the big dilemma for candy companies - how do you overcome that potential shortfall?"" 
A key part of the industry's marketing strategy is convincing people that going out is no longer an essential part of Halloween. 
The message candy makers are pushing is that shoppers should buy candy for Halloween-at-home in the three months leading up to the event. Retailers like Walmart Inc (N:WMT) and  Target  Corp (N:TGT) reinforced this idea when they started setting up Halloween displays as early as August, a move that has so far driven a 24.8% increase in Hershey's seasonal sales.
The trick is convincing the right people to shop for home celebrations while not alienating others who plan to continue to go door-to-door with their kids.
""We have the ability to tailor our advertising by ZIP Code,"" said Hershey spokeswoman Allison Kleinfelter, referring to a postal code used by the U.S. Postal Service to designate locations. ""Our team can see where there are differences like in cities or large states.""
The Google data that Hershey is mining weekly flags which people are more likely to go out and the degree to which local governments are restricting movement in their areas. Hershey said the data - which is completely anonymous, showing only the data points of unnamed users - is used with research from shopper surveys, retailers and municipalities.

""It's impossible to say how much more Hershey is going to be able to sell before Halloween, whether it'll be enough,""  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) analyst John Baumgartner said. ""But will they keep it from being a complete washout? It's possible.""

BEIJING (Reuters) - A micro electric vehicle (EV) by General Motors' (N:GM) local Chinese joint venture becomes the most sold EV model in China, with 15,000 cars sold in China last month, followed by Tesla Inc's (O:TSLA) 11,800 Model 3 sedans, industry data showed.
The model, the Hongguang MINI EV, is a two-door micro electric vehicle launched by the joint venture between GM, SAIC Motor Corp (SS:600104) and another partner, SGMW, in July.
The starting price for the Hongguang MINI EV is 28,800 yuan ($4,200), less than 10% of the 291,800 yuan starting price for Tesla's China-made Model 3 vehicles before they get government subsidies.
GM's new China boss Julian Blissett told Reuters in August that it would renew its focus on luxury Cadillacs, roll out bigger but greener sports-utility vehicles (SUVs) and target entry-level buyers with low-cost micro electric vehicles.
Tesla sold 11,000 Shanghai-made Model 3 vehicles in China in July, according to the China Passenger Car Association (CPCA). CPCA uses a different counting method than Tesla's official deliveries. Tesla and GM did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

196,By Investing.com,"<span>Sep 08, 2020 05:33AM ET</span>","StockBeat: Europcar Runs out of Road, but not Everybody's Hertz","By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- The rotation to cyclicals – if indeed it’s coming at all – has come too late for Europcar (PA:EUCAR).
The French-based car rental firm said on Tuesday it’s seeking talks with creditors on restructuring its debts, in an effort to stop following its larger and more famous peer Hertz into bankruptcy.
Europcar stock fell as much as 30% on the news, while its bonds due in 2024 and 2026 fell as much as 13 points, to trade around 37% of face value. If that’s all the bondholders think their investment is worth, then current shareholders, first and foremost French investment firm Eurazeo (PA:EURA) - are looking at a very negative outcome. 
Eurazeo’s stock fell 2.6% by 5:15 AM ET (0915 GMT), although that wasn’t much more severe than the broader market decline on a morning when Europe braced for more selling of U.S. tech stocks after the long Labor Day weekend.  The French CAC 40 fell 1.0% and the STOXX 600 fell 0.9%, undoing most of Monday’s gains.
The confirmation by Eurostat that Eurozone gross domestic product shrunk by an eye-watering 11.8% in the second quarter of the year – markedly worse than the performance of the U.S. economy - hardly helped sentiment.
Aside from the usual expressions of confidence in emerging from the current crisis stronger than ever before, the standout sentence in Europcar’s press release was the following, which underlined the difficulty of the road back to health for the travel sector in the wake of the pandemic.
Trying to rebrand themselves as mobility service providers hasn’t changed the reality that firms like Europcar still depend overwhelmingly on plain vanilla car rentals, and that the majority of that business is based at airports. Such business fell by as much as 90% during the second quarter.
Hopes for a quick rebound have been dashed by the clear evidence that increased tourist travel has gone hand in hand with the resurgence in Coronavirus cases during the summer. Easyjet stock fell 6.3% after it was forced to trim its flight schedule for the quarter after the U.K. government put a handful of popular Greek islands back on its list of high-risk destinations.  
And yet it would be wrong to tar all car hire firms with the same brush. As has been so often the case, the pandemic has merely hastened the demise of a company that had already started 2020 in trouble. German rival Sixt  (DE:SIXG), by contrast, is down only 12% year-to-date thanks to its stronger balance sheet. With cash of over 814 million euros and short-term debt maturities of only 380 million, it looks much better placed to ride out the current storm and survive until cyclicals return to fashion."
197,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 08, 2020 05:15AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Exxon downsizes global empire as Wall Street worries about dividend,"By Jennifer Hiller
HOUSTON (Reuters) - Ill-timed bets on rising demand have  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM) facing a shortfall of about $48 billion through 2021, according to a Reuters tally and Wall Street estimates, a situation that will require the top U.S. oil company to make deep cuts to its staff and projects.
Wall Street investors are even starting to worry about the once-sacrosanct dividend at Exxon, which in the 20th Century became the world's most valuable company using global scale, relentless expansion and strict financial controls. 
Exxon weathered a series of setbacks last decade and under Chief Executive Darren Woods sought to return to past prominence by big bets on U.S. shale oilfields, pipelines and global refining and plastics. It also bet big on offshore Guyana, where it discovered up to 8 billion barrels of oil, six years of production at its current rate. 
But Exxon's ability to finance that global expansion is no longer assured. This year the company borrowed $23 billion to pay its bills, nearly doubling its outstanding debt. In July, it posted its first back-to-back quarterly losses ever. It faces a full-year $1.86 billion loss, according to Refinitiv, excluding asset sales or write downs.
The looming shortfall of about $48 billion through 2021 was calculated using cash from operations, commitments to shareholder payouts and costs for the massive expansion program Exxon had planned. Now the company is embarking on a worldwide review of where it can cut expenses, and analysts believe the once unthinkable dividend cut has grown more likely. 
JOB REVIEWS, BENEFIT CUTS
This year's sharp drop in oil demand and pricing has shredded Woods' plan to spend at least $30 billion a year through 2025 to revive production and earnings by expanding in oil processing, chemicals and production, and by taking a commanding role in U.S. shale and liquefied natural gas, markets that then looked promising.
Instead, he must prepare Exxon to operate in a world of weaker demand for its oil, gas and plastics. The company has been dropped from the Dow Jones index of top U.S. industrial companies after 92 years. It is exposing up to 10% of U.S. staff to harsh reviews that could push thousands out of the company, and is taking away lavish retirement benefits that had career employees staying 30 years on average.
Exxon declined to make an executive available for an interview, and a spokesman said details of cost cuts would be disclosed early next year. 
""We remain committed to our capital allocation priorities – investing in industry advantaged projects, paying a reliable and growing dividend, and maintaining a strong balance sheet,"" said spokesman Casey Norton.  
A review of projects now underway aims to ""maximize efficiency and capture additional cost savings to put us in the strongest position"" as energy markets improve, he said. 
(For a graphic on cash from operations and asset sales, click here: https://graphics.reuters.com/GLOBAL-OIL/bdwvkzyyzpm/chart.png) 
Oil prices have dropped 35% from the start of 2020 as demand collapsed during the COVID-19 pandemic. BP (NYSE:BP), Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa), Total and Repsol (OTC:REPYY) and others have cut billions of dollars off the value of their oil and gas properties, something Exxon has yet to do. 
The European majors also are adding renewable energy and electricity to their portfolios, a hedge against permanently reduced oil and gas demand. BP plans by 2030 to reduce its fossil fuel production by 40%. It plans to sell even more fossil fuel properties if oil prices have a sustained rally.
DEBT NEARLY DOUBLES 
Exxon's cash from operations - estimated to be about $17.4 billion this year - is $20 billion below the funds needed for this year's already pared investment plan and shareholder dividend, a Reuters analysis showed.
The company's stock price closed Friday at $39.08, off 56% since Woods became CEO. He raised $23.19 billion in new debt this year to bolster finances, but has vowed not to borrow more and as recently as July insisted the dividend was sacrosanct. 
Investors say the commitments will be difficult to keep. ""At $41 or $42 [per barrel] crude, you can't put those puzzle pieces together and have them make sense,"" said Mark Stoeckle, senior portfolio manager at Adams Funds, which holds about $70 million in Exxon shares.
Exxon must cut its dividend if the share price remains depressed, Stoeckle said. ""Something has to give. Wherever the give comes hurts management credibility,"" he said. 
A cut would be ""cataclysmic"" for Exxon's stock, said equity analyst Paul Sankey of Sankey Research, given that executives in July reiterated its importance. 
Exxon's weak cash flow worries investors that hold the stock for its nearly 9% dividend. Matrix Asset Advisors has it on a ""watch list in terms of our conviction and their ability to defend and grow the dividend,"" said David Katz, chief investment officer at the New York firm.
SPENDING CUTS AND DEFERRALS
Exxon will slash spending in the Permian Basin shale field this year to about $3 billion from an original $7.4 billion budget, consultancy Rystad Energy estimates. 
The company has said it plans to reduce the number of drilling rigs there to 15 or fewer, from 55 early this year, and the company's pullback ""will continue,"" senior vice president Neil Chapman said in a July call. Spending on refining and chemicals plants that take years to design and complete, ""is really a question of deferral,"" he added. 
A $10 billion chemical plant in China remains subject to permits, the Exxon spokesman said. Spending limits will further constrain its oil, refining and plastics businesses and could revive pressure on the company to divest some operations. 
""Each of our core businesses could be a powerhouse in its own right,"" Woods said when he rolled out the vision in early 2017. At the time, he was pushing back at calls to spin off businesses to boost lagging returns.
Woods stuck to the growth targets last year, putting this year's potential earnings at $25.1 billion with oil at $60 a barrel and assuming flat refining and chemical margins. That forecast included 2020 cash flow and asset sales targets that have become unreachable since the pandemic hit. 
(For a graphic of Exxon's capital and exploration spending, go here: https://graphics.reuters.com/GLOBAL-OIL/EXXON/dgkpllkkqpb/chart.png) 
Analysts said that Woods must dial back. Project outlays next year could drop to between $10.4 billion and $15 billion, according to ScotiaBank and RBC Capital Markets, half the original outlook. 
NO URGENCY FOR LNG
Some project schedules are being quietly stretched to save costs. 
Construction at a $10 billion-plus LNG facility in Texas where Exxon holds a 30% stake already was moving slowly and now ""there isn't the urgency,"" said Alex Munton, with consulting and data firm Wood Mackenzie. He expects its startup will be delayed a year, to 2025 at the earliest. 
A massive LNG project in Mozambique likely will not get a final investment decision until 2023, as an expansion of Exxon LNG exports in Papua, New Guinea, is delayed by government talks and low LNG prices, Munton said. 
""The reality is that Exxon is not moving forward with either of those in the near term,"" Munton said. 
In Mexico, Exxon will likely reduce offshore activity after its first well was not commercial, according to people familiar with its operations. It will instead focus on fuel imports and retail sales, they said. 
Exxon has begun exploration drilling in Brazil, where the company returned in 2017 to become second only to state-controlled Petroleo Brasileiro SA in holdings of offshore exploration acreage. But ""spend and activity deferrals cannot be ruled out as part of any cost-cutting,"" said Ruaraidh Montgomery, director at Welligence Energy Analytics. 
Other projects already begun, including the $1.9 billion expansion of its Beaumont, Texas, refinery, face an up to one year postponement.
Exxon declined to comment on the LNG, Mexico or Brazil spending. 

Other than Guyana, ""there will be no other sacred cow in the near-term budget,"" said analyst Paul Cheng of ScotiaBank.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Chinese video app TikTok, owned by Chinese company ByteDance, will be joining the European Union's voluntary code of conduct to combat illegal hate speech online, the European Commission said on Tuesday.
Social media platforms have come under increasing pressure from politicians and governments to do more to tackle online hate speech and disinformation, which have been blamed for helping to fuel a wave of racist attacks in some countries.
The Commission set up the code of conduct in May 2016 where tech companies work with civil society organisations and public authorities to remove online hate speech.
Commission Vice President for values and transparency Vera Jourova said the new addition to a group, whose members include Facebook (O:FB), Microsoft (O:MSFT), Twitter (N:TWTR), Google's (O:GOOG) YouTube and Snapchat, was a positive step.
""It's good that TikTok joined the code – a company favoured by young users who are particularly vulnerable to online abuse and illegal hate speech,"" she said in a statement.
""Of course, I expect TikTok to adhere not only to the Code's principles, but also fully respect European law when operating on European soil,"" Jourova said.

""Our ultimate goal is to eliminate hate on TikTok. We recognise that this may seem an insurmountable challenge as the world is increasingly polarised, but we believe that this shouldn't stop us from trying,"" TikTok's head of trust and safety for EMEA Cormac Keenan said in a statement.

Investing.com - European stock markets weakened Tuesday amid worries the recent tech selloff on Wall Street will continue when the U.S. market returns from holiday.
At 4:25 AM ET (0825 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.5% lower and the CAC 40 in France fell 1.0%. The U.K.'s FTSE index was down just 0.4%, outperforming as the index’s exporting companies benefited from sterling’s weakness caused by the revival of Brexit tail risks.
Investors are keeping a wary eye on the return of the U.S. market after the Labor Day holiday, and the news doesn't look good with U.S. futures contracts pointing to a sharply lower open, particularly for the dominant tech sector. This has seen mammoth gains throughout the Covid-19 pandemic, but it hit the skids late last week due to doubts over positioning and stretched valuations.
Elsewhere, the European Central Bank meets on Thursday, and expectation is growing that it may be forced into action following the Federal Reserve’s change in inflation tolerance at its last meeting at the end of August.
“The ECB is under pressure to prevent further strengthening of the EUR with core inflation already at record-lows. We expect [President Christine] Lagarde to bring promises of more policy easing to next week’s ECB meeting, if not concrete easing measures,” analysts at Nordea said, in a research note published late last week.
The eurozone economy is expected to rebound in the third quarter from a record-breaking drop in the three months through June. France's official statistics agency confirmed earlier Tuesday its forecast of a 9% drop in gross domestic product in 2020 due to the coronavirus pandemic. Overall though, second-quarter GDP numbers have been close to the ECB's baseline forecast, board member Isabel Schnabel said last week.
In corporate news,  Travis Perkins  (LON:TPK) stock dropped 7% after the builders merchant posted a pretax loss for the first half of the year and declined to declare an interim dividend.
EasyJet slumped 4.2% as the airline said additional quarantine restrictions to seven Greek Islands will mean it will fly “slightly less than 40%” of its planned schedule over the current quarter. Elsewhere in the travel sector, car rental company Europcar fell over 30% as it announced a major debt restructuring.
On the flip side, JD (NASDAQ:JD) Sports Fashion (LON:JD) jumped 7% as the sporting-goods retailer reporting an encouraging start to the second half of its trading year.
Oil prices dropped Tuesday, with the U.S. WTI contract suffering the bulk of the selling after the U.S. Labor Day long weekend, which marks the end of the peak U.S. driving season.
U.S. crude futures traded 3.6% lower at $38.37 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract fell 1.6% to $41.36.

The Enforcement Directorate and the Central Bureau of Investigation have been investigating Deepak Kochhar, head of the company NuPower Renewables and his wife Chanda Kochhar on suspicion of cheating, criminal conspiracy and money laundering.
The accusations led to Chanda Kochhar, who had been one of India's few senior women bankers, resigning her position at ICICI (NS:ICBK) almost two years ago.

Full-time employees who have worked for 26 or more working days between July to August will be given a bonus worth half their August base salary, according to a letter from ByteDance to its employees that was seen by Reuters.
""Thank you for your hard work and dedication,"" the letter says. ByteDance has said it has over 60,000 employees globally.
The bonus could run into hundreds of millions of yuan, based on ByteDance's hiring advertisements and company sources. 
ByteDance confirmed the letter but did not provide details. 
ByteDance has come under global scrutiny amid concerns about TikTok's collection of personal data and censoring of political content. The United States has said it will ban the short video app unless ByteDance sells the app's U.S. operations amid rising tensions between Washington and Beijing.
ByteDance has said the Chinese government does not have any jurisdiction over TikTok content.

The shares opened at HK$39.89 ($5.14) per share on Tuesday, before settling at HK$33.30 as of 13:09 AM ET (6:09 AM GMT).
Nongfu offered 388.2 million shares at HK$21.50 each and will use the HK$8.35 billion ($1.08 billion) in proceeds raised to fund company growth. A HKSE filing showed that retail shares were oversubscribed by a record 1,147 times, raking in HK$677 billion (US$87 billion) for the company. Cornerstone investors included Fidelity, Coatue and Singapore’s GIC.

An eight-year probe found that Standard Chartered violated the so-called foreign exchange management act -- which monitors offshore financial transactions -- when it worked with a group of investors to buy a stake in Tamilnad  Mercantile Bank  (NASDAQ:MBWM) Ltd. in 2007, according to an August order from India’s enforcement agency that was seen by Bloomberg.
“Senior officials at Standard Chartered saw an investment in TMB shares as an opportunity that might ripen into an eventually larger ownership for the bank,” Sushil Kumar, the enforcement agency’s special director, said in the order.
A representative for the British lender confirmed receipt of the order, adding that the bank was evaluating it and so unable to comment further.
Escrow Accounts
Standard Chartered -- India’s largest foreign bank by branches -- also acted as a custodian for shares on the deal, according to the order. Tamilnad Mercantile was fined almost 170 million rupees for similar charges, the order said.
A spokesman at Tamilnad Mercantile declined to comment, while the Enforcement Directorate didn’t immediately respond to an email seeking comment.
The case dates back to about 13 years ago when Tamilnad Mercantile transferred 46,862 shares to overseas investors, including GHI Ltd., Swiss Re (OTC:SSREY) Investors, FI Investments and Cuna Group, without seeking permission from India’s central bank, according to the order. Some of those shares were then transferred to Sub-Continental Equities Ltd., an affiliate of Standard Chartered in April 2008, without the Reserve Bank of India’s permission, it said.
The transfers were done through escrow accounts with Standard Chartered, which acted as a transaction agent and a lender to one of the investors on the deal, the order said.
“Standard Chartered through its affiliate Subcontinental was a proposed and eventually an actual investor in TMB shares to be purchased through the escrow agreement arrangements,” Kumar said.

The Seattle-based coffee chain said it was introducing products in markets such as Hong Kong, Singapore, New Zealand, Taiwan and Thailand that suit local tastes and preferences.
Producing plant-based food and beverages is less demanding on the environment compared with items relying on animal agriculture, which typically needs far more land and water.
Starbucks said its new food items will include the Spiced Impossible Puff and Maize Impossible Sandwich in Hong Kong, and Beyond Meat Bolognese Penne in Taiwan.
In Singapore, it will launch the Impossible Wrap comprising an Impossible Burger patty, avocado omelette, mushroom, caramelised onion and cheese.
Drinks will include the Oatmilk Cocoa Macchiato from Oatly in Malaysia, the Philippines and elsewhere.

Starbucks began offering plant-based meals in Canada in February, and in April said it would do likewise in China. The initiative comes as Impossible Foods, Oatly and Beyond Meat look to expand into Asia.

LONDON (Reuters) - Willie Walsh will pass the controls of IAG to Luis Gallego at the British Airways and Iberia owner's annual meeting on Tuesday, where shareholders will be asked to stump up billions of euros to help it through the coronavirus crisis.
Former pilot Walsh delayed his departure from International Consolidated Airlines Group (L:ICAG), which he created by dragging BA and Iberia into the modern age of budget flying, taking a tough line on unions and cutting costs.
Walsh, who has been CEO of BA since 2005 and of IAG since it was created in 2011, faces one last test as Institutional Shareholder Services have called to reject his farewell 883,000 pound ($1.16 million), although the vote on the airline group's remuneration report is non-binding. 
Meanwhile Gallego, a Spanish insider who turned around Iberia, will have to cut costs, while managing damaged relations with unions and politicians and stepping up the group's battle with Ryanair (I:RYA) and easyJet (L:EZJ).
IAG's position is expecting to be strengthened by raising 2.75 billion euros ($3.25 billion) from shareholders in a rights issue which is backed by its biggest shareholder Qatar. 
""Major shareholders are satisfied that IAG's equity raise will be enough to weather the crisis… or at least that's their hope,"" one banking source told Reuters.
At BA, where 12,000 jobs are set to go and new terms have been set for long-serving staff, unions have vowed to fight and the British government said the plan was a ""breach of faith"" after it accessed state funds to pay wages during the crisis.
Gallego will also have to restore services, the airline was only flying 20% of its pre-COVID 19 schedule last month, and stem a cash outflow of 20 million pounds a day.

The United Kingdom left the EU on Jan 31 but is trying to hammer out a trade deal with the bloc by the end of the year.
The divorce veered into fresh crisis this week after London threatened to undermine the exit agreement unless free trade terms are agreed by next month.
The British economy also shrank by a record 20.4% in the second quarter due to COVID-19 restrictions, underperforming the United States and the euro zone.
Edward Glyn, head of global markets at Calastone, said the two issues were ""prompting investors to dump their UK holdings"".
UK funds saw 667 million pounds of outflows in June, 368 million in July and 195 million in August, while non-UK funds collectively saw a total of 1.6 billion pounds in inflows over the same period, Calastone said.
More than two thirds of UK-based fund flows by value pass across the Calastone network each month.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration said Sunday it is investigating manufacturing flaws involving some Boeing (NYSE:BA) 787 Dreamliners but said it was too early to say if it will require new inspections.
Boeing said in August airlines operating its 787 Dreamliners had removed eight jets from service as a result of two distinct manufacturing issues in fuselage sections.
The FAA could require inspections covering hundreds of 787 jetliners after production issues at one plant, a person briefed on the matter confirmed. The Wall Street Journal reported the potential inspections earlier, citing an internal government memo and people familiar with the matter.
""The agency continues to engage with Boeing,"" the FAA said Sunday. ""It is too early to speculate about the nature or extent of any proposed Airworthiness Directives that might arise from the agency’s investigation.""
Boeing said Sunday ""the rest of the in-service fleet has been determined to meet limit load capability, and we are inspecting production airplanes to ensure any issues are addressed prior to delivery.""
Boeing said some airplanes have shims that are not the proper size, and some airplanes have areas that do not meet skin flatness specifications.
""Individually these issues, while not up to specifications, still meet limit load conditions. When combined in the same location however, they result in a condition that does not meet limit load requirements,"" Boeing said. 
In the memo dated Aug. 31, Boeing told FAA that it had manufactured some parts at its South Carolina facilities that failed to meet its standards, according to WSJ. (https://on.wsj.com/33li4vp)
Such a safety directive could potentially cover up to about 900 Dreamliners delivered since 2011, the person briefed on the matter confirmed.
It is not clear how many airplanes may have just one of the two reported issues.

The world's biggest brewer is considering external candidates to replace Brito, who has been its CEO for 16 years and has overseen a string of mergers that transformed two Brazilian and Belgium drink-makers into a global giant, the FT reported, citing people with knowledge of the matter. 
AB InBev declined to comment on the FT report, which also said that the company is currently considering only one internal candidate, Michel Doukeris, who heads its North America-based Anheuser-Busch business.
Brito is involved with the board in the process and plans to step down at some point next year, the FT said, citing one person. It is also possible that Brito remains in charge for longer if a replacement is not found, it said, added that Brito was expected to join AB InBev's board after stepping down.
Bernstein Research said in a note that the timing of the leadership change made sense, with the COVID-19 crisis potentially abating and the company needing to shift focus to more internal growth after years of acquisition-led expansion. 
It said it also made sense to look outside the company, but it was most likely that an internal candidate would prevail, with Doukeris the clear frontrunner.
AB InBev, which makes Stella Artois and Corona, is working with recruitment firm Spencer Stuart on the search, the FT said. 
Brazilian-born Brito's biggest deal to date was the near-$100 billion takeover in 2016 of its nearest rival SABMiller (LON:SAB), whose business in Africa plugged a critical hole in the company's global footprint. 
However, AB InBev's shares are currently trading 60% below their all-time high of 2015, partly due to concerns over the deal-related debt, which was at a net $87.4 billion at the end of June.

In response, the company has halved its final 2019 dividend and sold assets, including its Australian business to Japan's Asahi (T:2502).

“We’ll manufacture our critical manufacturing supplies in the United States, we’ll create ‘made in America’ tax credits and bring our jobs back to the United States and we’ll impose tariffs on companies that desert America to create jobs in China and other countries,” Trump said at a White House news conference on Monday where he complained at length about his Democratic re-election opponent.
“If they can’t do it here, then let them pay a big tax to build it someplace else and send it into our country,” he said of U.S. corporations. “We’ll prohibit federal contracts from companies that outsource to China and we’ll hold China accountable for allowing the virus to spread around the world.”
Trump has recently entertained the idea of “decoupling” the U.S. economy from China, a dream of U.S. China hawks.
“Whether it’s decoupling or putting massive tariffs on China which I’ve been doing already,” he said. “We’re going to end our reliance on China because we can’t rely on China and I don’t want them building a military like they’re building right now and they’re using our money to build it.”
He did not say when he would implement the policies but framed the moves as part of a second-term agenda.
“If Biden wins, China wins because China will own this country,” Trump said. “It’s the most important election in our history, right now, most important election in our history. Under my administration we will make America into the manufacturing superpower of the world and we’ll end our reliance on China once and for all.”
Trump has sought to make China an election-year issue. He has portrayed Biden as a lackey of Beijing and has blamed the country for the U.S. coronavirus outbreak, as polls show widespread public disapproval of the president’s handling of the pandemic.
Biden has turned the argument against the president, accusing Trump of being soft on China to secure a so-called “phase-one” trade deal in January and only toughening his posture after his administration lost control of the coronavirus outbreak.

ROME (Reuters) - Italian Economy Minister Roberto Gualtieri has signed off on a government decree listing options to sell Italy's controlling stake in Monte dei Paschi di Siena (MI:BMPS), two sources close to the matter told Reuters.
Rome rescued Monte dei Paschi in 2017, spending 5.4 billion euros ($6.4 billion) on a 68% stake which under the terms of the bailout negotiated with European Union competition authorities must be sold next year.
Gualtieri's signature paves the way for final approval by Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, the two sources said, asking not to be named because of the sensitivity of the matter.
The Italian Treasury declined to comment.
Although Italy's co-ruling 5-Star Movement wants the state to delay its exit from Monte dei Paschi, sources have told Reuters the Treasury is working to find a buyer by the end of the year.
The goal is to combine a merger with a complex scheme to free the bank of its remaining problem loans, sources said.
While Banco BPM (MI:BAMI) is seen by the Treasury as a good partner, the Milan-based bank has repeatedly denied any interest in a tie-up with Monte dei Paschi.
The decree, obtained by Reuters, authorises the Treasury to help Monte dei Paschi shed 8.1 billion euros in problem debts through a deal with state-owned bad loan manager AMCO.
This clean-up ""is essential to give the bank the prospect of a lasting return to profitability ... and pave the way for the economy ministry to sell its holding,"" the decree states.
Rome also lists ways the government can liquidate its holding, which include a share offerings, a public tender or negotiating a merger.

Regularly cited by environmental groups such as Greenpeace as one of the top plastic polluters, the food giant has vowed to reduce its use of new plastics by a third by 2025 and spend up to 2 billion Swiss francs ($2.19 billion) to boost recycled plastics.
""Packaging (NYSE:PKG) plays an essential role in preserving the integrity and safety of our food. At the same time, plastic pollution continues to be a major issue around the world,"" head of operations Magdi Batato told reporters in the virtual briefing.
""We have made bold commitments and we will deliver,"" he said. 
The Swiss-based company said it recently launched a refillable system for pet food in Chile allowing deliveries to consumers without extra packaging.
Plastic waste caused by takeaway food containers and online delivery packaging has increased during the COVID-19 pandemic as more people ordered food and groceries online.
Eliminating packaging is one aspect of Nestle's strategy, while another is replacing plastic with more sustainable materials. 
Nestle, which is already selling KitKat chocolate bars in paper packaging, said its engineers had developed a new kind of recyclable paper to wrap Maggi bouillon cubes that will soon be launched in France. 
Batato said it was difficult to give a goal for the usage of paper packaging as there was no one-size-fits-all solution for all products and geographies. Plastic is not going away, either.
""Plastic will remain a component of packaging,"" he said. 

(This story corrects first paragraph to show 87% of Nestle's packaging is currently reusable and recyclable, and not 87% of its plastic packaging)

The acquisition by Worldline, which was born out of French IT company Atos (PA:ATOS), is emblematic of a wave of mergers and acquisitions that U.S. rivals kicked off last year as they try to build up their share of digital transactions.
If Worldline is not able to allay EU concerns and in the absence of concessions, the deal would face a full-scale investigation following the end of the EU's preliminary review.
Worldline has until Wednesday to offer concessions to the European Commission, unless it can convince the EU competition enforcer prior to that deadline that the move is unnecessary.
The Commission, which is due to decide on the deal by Sept. 16, declined to comment. Ingenico had no immediate comment.
""We're pursuing the usual procedure of discussions with the Commission and the process is underway, within the expected timetable,"" Worldline said.
Ingenico's strong presence in the travel, health and retail sectors is one of its main attractions for Worldline, while the combined company would have also have an extended partnership with German savings banks.

MADRID (Reuters) - The controlling shareholders in Spain's Caixabank and state-owned  Bankia  are close to agreeing on Valencia as their joint headquarters but are still mulling other aspects of the planned takeover, two sources with knowledge of the deal said on Monday.
The choice of the headquarters has become a sensitive political issue as pro-independence parties in the neighboring region of Catalonia, who could play a pivotal role in passing Spain's 2020 budget, have advocated for Caixabank to move its HQ back to Barcelona from Valencia, Spain's third-largest city.
""The negotiations between controlling shareholders in the two lenders are at a very advanced stage on picking Valencia as the HQ though the agreement has not been closed yet,"" one of the sources said.
Bankia (MC:BKIA), Caixabank (MC:CABK) and the Economy Ministry declined to comment.
Bankia established its HQ in Valencia after a merger of seven former savings banks in 2010. Caixabank decided to move to Valencia in October 2017 in a bid to calm deposit holders in the aftermath of the banned Catalan independence referendum.
Bankia and Caixabank said on Thursday they were negotiating a takeover by the latter to form the biggest lender in Spain with more than 600 billion euros ($709 billion). The deal would give both lenders a combined market capitalization of 16.4 billion euros, according to current market valuations.
Banks across Europe are struggling to cope with record low interest rates and the economic downturn sparked by the COVID-19 pandemic, leading analysts to predict more tie-ups to cut costs.
One of the sources said that the premium Caixabank was expected to pay to acquire Bankia and potential capital increase to fund the deal was still being discussed.
Spanish investment firm Alantra said in a note ""a 15-20% premium would be fair for Bankia shareholders and financially affordable for Caixabank"". 
On Friday after the announcement, Bankia shares soared almost 33%, while Caixabank rose 12.4%.
The state is expected to reduce its stake to around 14% from the current 61.8% it holds in Bankia, while the Caixabank's foundation, its main shareholders, would have around 30%.

One source with knowledge of the matter said that the talks between shareholders and lenders first took place between April and May and gained track in July.

The advert by TRESemmé, a  Unilever  Plc (L:ULVR) brand, showed an image of African black hair which it described as ""dry and damaged"", while an example of white hair was referred to as ""fine and flat"".
The advert, posted on Clicks' website on Friday, provoked a backlash on social media and the retailer removed it the same day. It apologized, as did TRESemmé South Africa.
But on Monday, protesters led by hard-left party Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) demanded Clicks stores be shut for at least a week. Some wore EFF's trademark red hard-hats and overalls and sung struggle songs outside Clicks stores. 
""White people insult us and then they apologize, they think that's the end. We are no longer going to accept any apology which is not accompanied by justice,"" EFF leader Julius Malema told supporters outside a closed Clicks store in Polokwane in the province of Limpopo. ""Who is punished for projecting black people as ugly people?""
Video footage on Twitter showed protesters toppling shelves and destroying products in one store. Another, in Witbank in Mpumalanga province, appeared to have suffered fire damage.
Clicks said there were protests at 37 stores in Kwa-Zulu Natal, Gauteng and Western Cape provinces. Seven stores were damaged. It was not clear which stores had shut. 
""The negligent employees have been suspended, and we have engaged the supplier, who has now also issued an apology,"" Clicks Chief Executive Vikesh Ramsunder said of the advert.
Facing accusations of racial prejudice, Unilever said in June it would drop the word ""fair"" from its “Fair & Lovely” skin lightening products.

The S&P 500 has fallen 4.3% over the last two sessions, though remains up 53% from its March lows at the height of fears about the coronavirus. The tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 Index fell 6.4% over Thursday and Friday. Given those substantive declines and the three-day Labor Day weekend, technical strategist Robert Sluymer says there’s a risk of a further downdraft.
“We would not be surprised to see the ‘three-day rule’ take effect,” Sluymer wrote in a note. “Steep selloffs often take at least three days to wash out the panic sellers.”
Nasdaq 100 futures were down about 1% as of 9 a.m. New York time Monday, while S&P 500 e-mini futures were little-changed.
The sudden back-to-back losses came after a ferocious run-up notable for a rare simultaneous increase in volatility, the outperformance of a few megacaps and unusually heavy options volume. Some strategists see it as simply a removal of froth, rather than a longer-term decline, while Fundstrat’s view remains unchanged that the recent drop is a healthy consolidation, Sluymer said.
The Nasdaq in particular tends to fall very rapidly from its peaks, according to Jason Goepfert, the founder of Sundial Capital Research Inc. So if it is really a top, there could be “an almost straight-down move in the weeks ahead,” he warned in a note Friday.

Market activity was likely to remain subdued for the rest of the day with the U.S. closed for the Labor Day holiday, though Nasdaq futures fell a further 1%.
""This market rally may likely pause given stretched valuations,"" said Stephane Ekolo, an equity strategist at TFS Derivatives in London. ""If earnings do not improve materially, investors might well need to buckle up and expect a correction.""
European bourses, which have fewer technology stocks compared with the United States, started the week in the black, driven by a 1.6% gain in Germany's DAX and London's FTSE 100.
UK bluechip stocks, many of which derive much of their profits overseas, were also helped by a falling pound, with Brexit talks plunging into crisis following Britain's threat to override its EU divorce deal. Sterling fell around half a percent against the dollar and euro on Monday.
""It is almost inevitable that the perceived probability of 'no deal' will escalate over the coming weeks,"" Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) analysts wrote in a note.
The tech sell-off showed no signs of abating as Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), the poster child of the euphoria in U.S. big technology stocks, fell 4.5% in Frankfurt after it was excluded from a group of companies that were being added to the S&P 500.
U.S.-heavy MSCI world shares index was up 0.3%. The index had hit a record high last week, driven by unprecedented central bank stimulus, but the rally fizzled out last week amid worries over heady valuations and a patchy economic recovery. 
""Our risk indices have begun to turn from their euphoria highs,"" Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) said, adding that it was switching its weighting on the MSCI All-World index to ""tactically bearish"" in the short term.
""On the balance of probabilities, last week's correction has further room to go.""
In Asia, China's blue-chip index slipped 2.3% as the possible U.S. blacklisting of China's largest chip maker, Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp (SMIC), hit tech firms across the board.
TENTATIVE MOOD
The mood across Asian markets was tentative. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was last down 0.2% after two straight days of losses toppled it from a 2-1/2-year peak last week.
Data earlier on Monday showed Chinese imports fell 2.1% in August from a year earlier, confounding expectations for a 0.1% increase, in a sign of sluggish domestic demand. Exports jumped by a larger-than-expected 9.5%. 
Japan's Nikkei fell 0.5% with SoftBank coming under heavy selling pressure following media reports it has spent at least $4 billion buying call options on listed U.S. technology stocks.
In currency markets, the dollar index gained 0.1% in holiday-thinned trade on Monday, while traders shifted their focus to the European Central Bank's meeting on Thursday. Most analysts don't expect a change in policy stance. 
The dollar was flat against the yen at 106.28 ahead of a heavy week of macroeconomic data with figures on household spending, current account and gross domestic product due on Tuesday.
The message the ECB will deliver on its inflation forecasts is likely to set the direction for the euro, which has surged in the past few months.
European government bonds yields rose across the board on Monday on signs of an improved global economy and ahead of a week of healthy supply, as countries seek bond markets to help fund the response to the COVID-19 crisis.
In commodities, oil prices hit their lowest since July, after Saudi Arabia made the deepest monthly price cuts for supply to Asia in five months. U.S. crude fell 1.3% to $39.25 a barrel. Brent crude skidded to $42.11.

The benchmark gauge for emerging-market stocks is down 0.4% and its currency counterpart is little changed. That suggests investors are biding their time as they weigh the proliferating risks, from a technology-sector meltdown to U.S.-China tensions.
But broader indexes that average out market moves can mask regional, sectoral and asset-class differentiation. That’s what seemed to be happening since the Thursday selloff in the Nasdaq 100 Index.
There are signs that the laggards of the past five months -- currencies as well as stocks outside Asia, especially in non-technology sectors -- are starting a phase of outperformance.
Stocks in the emerging Europe, Middle East and Africa region fell to a record low against their Asian peers on Sept. 2, the day before the Nasdaq slump. Since then, they have climbed for three days. On Monday, the ratio of the indexes between the two regions rose by the most since Aug. 12.
That’s not the only sign. A gauge of emerging-market commodity stocks against consumer-discretionary stocks is heading for the biggest three-day increase since November 2016. Given that the latter includes star performer  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd., that is a major shift in favor of raw-material stocks.
More broadly, so-called value stocks are now outperforming growth stocks. In other words, investors are beginning to favor shares of mature, slow-growing and dividend-paying companies over expensive go-getters like Alibaba.
Time May Be Ripe for Attitude Change to Maligned EM Value Stocks
And then there’s emerging resilience of currencies. The FX gauge has risen to the highest level since Aug. 3 versus stocks. If this continues, it would mark a reversal of their underperformance since March.

225,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 07, 2020 07:10AM ET</span>","The fund managers, the sleuths and the mystery of the missing ESG","By Tommy Wilkes, Sujata Rao and Simon Jessop
LONDON (Reuters) - If fund managers are serious about clean investments, they need to get their hands dirty. That's the view of Sasja Beslik, head of sustainable finance at Swiss bank J. Safra Sarasin, as demand surges for companies that perform well on environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues.
He himself has turned ESG detective in the past, flying to southern India after reading studies that found high water pollution levels around some factories mass-producing medicines. 
Accompanied by a cameraman, Beslik spent 10 days meeting villagers and taking samples from streams close to the plants supplying companies that his then-firm had invested in.
He said his samples were confiscated by airport authorities, but that he sent his video evidence of foaming scum in streams to 27 international and local companies with operations there.
""We got a response in a week from all of them,"" he said, adding that most were keen to fix the problem. Returning to India a year later, he found many of the factories had ""improved the capacity of the water-treatment plants"".
Beslik's visits were in late 2017 and 2018, but he says it's now more important than ever to probe ESG credentials, rather than relying on ratings assigned by data providers that are often based on self-reporting by companies. 
Investor demand for companies deemed to have high ESG standards has never been higher. ESG-focused funds manage $1.1 trillion, more than double 2016 levels, according to industry tracker Morningstar.
As much as anything, such investments are a way to mitigate risk; Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) estimates more than $600 billion of S&P 500 company market capitalisation alone was lost to ""ESG controversies"" in the last seven years.
Recent high-profile examples include German payments firm Wirecard (DE:WDIG) and British fashion retailer  Boohoo  (L:BOOH), where allegations of accounting fraud and factory labour abuses, respectively, erased years - and in Boohoo's case, months - of returns in a matter of days.
Wirecard collapsed into insolvency in June after disclosing a 1.9-billion-euro hole in its accounts. Boohoo launched an independent review of its supply chain in July and defended its business practices https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-health-coronavirus-boohoo-group-leice/boohoo-defends-supply-chain-practices-after-leicester-report-idUKKBN2430Y2, following newspaper allegations about low pay and poor conditions at suppliers' factories in the city of Leicester.
Beslik, who heads a team of eight ESG specialists at J. Safra Sarasin, is now focusing on Democratic Republic of Congo to assess mining of cobalt, a key component of batteries used by tech firms and carmakers. The cobalt industry has been dogged by allegations of child labour and environmental damage.
He is by no means the only player turning ESG sleuth, reflecting the shifting demands of the investment industry.
Vontobel Asset Management's head of ESG, Sudhir Roc-Sennet, employs three ex-investigative journalists to bolster his traditional team of analysts. A central element of their job is kicking the tires on ESG scores.
One example concerned Nestle. Despite the firm's AA ESG score from one provider, Vontobel became concerned in 2018 about media and NGO reports of excessive water use at Nestle's U.S. bottled water subsidiary.
Roc-Sennet remains invested in Nestle, praising its overall environmental track record. But after consulting water rights lawyers, hydrogeologists, and environmental inspectors, Vontobel pushed Nestle to reduce water intensity - the amount of freshwater used per million dollars of sales.
It's unclear whether Vontobel's efforts led to Nestle reducing its water intensity, which had been falling for years across its businesses. 
Nestle said the amount of freshwater used per bottle at the U.S. subsidiary was one of the lowest among beverages and its ""team of engineers, hydrologists, biologists and geologists consistently monitors and cares for the springs and local environment in California"". 
Headline ESG scores can miss such issues, Roc-Sennet said.
""The water division is small and Nestle's other business is sustainable,"" he said. 
When data isn't available, basic detective work is the answer, he says. 
To assess diversity among senior management at companies, for example, he has scoured the web to check ""thousands of photos and names, doing Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) searches on people's backgrounds"". 
(Graphic: ESG funds assets under management, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/yzdpxxkaqpx/TOMMYESG.PNG) 
'IN THE FIRST INNINGS'
Providers of ESG scores, including Sustainalytics, MSCI and Refinitiv, which is part-owned by Reuters News' parent company, say that alongside company disclosures they use external sources including media and NGO reports. Some, like Truevalue Labs, say they eschew company data altogether.
But the system has flaws. 
Small companies with limited disclosure can earn lower scores than multinationals, meaning relatively new renewable energy outfits might rank below tobacco giants.
Scores can also vary wildly across providers. In contrast to credit-ratings agencies, whose assessments vary significantly in just 0.1% of cases, one in four ESG ratings differ between providers, according to Nathan Cockrell, Lazard (NYSE:LAZ) Asset Management's co-director of global research.
Take Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) - its environmental scores range from 10% to 65%, where 100% is the best possible score, according to a 2019 study by Anthony Renshaw at financial intelligence firm Qontigo. Tesla can rank both above and below rivals Ford and General Motors (NYSE:GM).
Another example is Saudi oil firm Aramco (SE:2222). It is rated an average BB by MSCI but carries an ESG risk rating of ""severe"" from Sustainalytics.
Boohoo scored highly across some providers when the newspaper investigation lopped nearly 50% off its share price in three days. That was despite long-standing media allegations of issues in its supply chain. 
Simon MacMahon, head of research at Sustainalytics, acknowledged ESG scoring relied on information that was ""quite incomplete, sometimes inconsistent and sometimes of low quality"", but said methodology had improved.
""ESG as an industry is still maturing ... We are in the first innings of a nine-innings game,"" he said. 
An MSCI spokesperson said ESG ratings should be one of many factors investors use while conducting due diligence, and are not investment recommendations. 
Many managers subscribe not just for headline scores but to access underlying research and data, ESG data providers say.
CHALLENGING ASSUMPTIONS
But gaps and inconsistencies are spurring some fund managers to determine ESG credentials for themselves. This may involve investigating basic assumptions.
Railways usually rank highly on ESG metrics because of low carbon emissions, but Hans Stegemann at Triodos Investment Management found out his fund was invested in a Canadian rail firm that transported shale gas and oil. 
They sold their stake, Stegeman said, adding: ""There was no positive (ESG) impact."" 
A company's culture can be crucial, yet is difficult for scoring systems to evaluate.
Sharon Bentley-Hamlyn, investment director at Aubrey Capital Management, said a little digging can help verify management claims. Impressed by British concrete paving firm  Marshalls  (L:MSLH), Aubrey visited their quarry in the Scottish town of Falkirk.
""We found great attention to detail, talked to employees and found them very proud to be working for the company. They had invested heavily in systems for health-and-safety training,"" she said.
Yet ESG screening can, in the short-run at least, conflict with maximising returns - Boohoo shares are still up 120% from 2017. Managers who ditched tech stocks after 2015 on concerns about data privacy and cobalt supplies missed a huge rally.
Beslik of J. Safra Sarasin said inconsistencies between ESG scores and reality could ultimately leave investors exposed.

""There is a huge gap in the world of ESG investing,"" he added. ""A gap between what ESG investments stipulate that they do and what is really going on on the ground. One day it will boomerang back and it will hurt the entire industry.""

226,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 07, 2020 06:45AM ET</span>",Kering Swiss watch brands cut staff by 25% after pandemic hits sales,"ZURICH (Reuters) - Kering-owned (PA:PRTP) Swiss watch brands Ulysse Nardin and Girard-Perregaux said on Monday they were cutting about 100 jobs, or a quarter of their total workforce, after sales were hit by the coronavirus crisis.
The Swiss watch industry has seen demand collapse during the pandemic as stores around the world stayed closed for months and Chinese tourists no longer flocked to luxury shopping hubs like Paris.
""The sudden sales downturn caused by the pandemic, and thereafter, the watch sector's timid recovery, have led to the decision to scale down these manufacturing capabilities,"" the two brands said in a statement.
Patrick Pruniaux, CEO of the two brands since 2018, said the economic repercussions of the pandemic were ""likely to have a ripple effect over the next several years"".
French luxury group  Kering  's Swiss watch brands were among those at Geneva Watch Days 10 days ago to try to revitalize demand, but executives at the trade fair said they feared jobs would be lost, in particular at suppliers.
Kering said in its half-year report in July that Ulysse Nardin and Girard-Perregaux, acquired in 2014 and 2011 respectively, were in ""in-depth transformation processes"" after operating in a fragile market environment for years.
The two brands' sales contracted sharply and their losses worsened in the first half of 2020, leading Kering to book asset impairment losses of 201 million euros ($238 million) for the watch brands and fashion label Brioni.

(Reuters) - Foreigners turned net sellers of Asian shares in August as relations between China and the United States remained fragile, while Indian equities drew in foreign funds for a fourth straight month, with net inflows of $6.3 billion.
Cross-border investors sold a combined net total of $6.25 billion worth of equities in Taiwanese, South Korean, Thai, Indonesian and Philippine stocks in August, data from stock exchanges showed.
GRAPHIC: Foreign investments in Asian equities - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/gjnpwabazpw/Foreign%20investments%20in%20Asian%20equities.jpg
Manishi Raychaudhuri, Asia-Pacific equity strategist at BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY), put the concerns down to the latest bout of tensions between Washington and Beijing over the tech sector.
Tech-heavy South Korean and Taiwanese equities saw outflows of over $2 billion each, while Thailand and Indonesia had outflows of $875 million and $583 million, respectively.
Concern over India's coronavirus outbreak has continued to grow, with officials easing restrictions on business and movement at a time when new infections are heading for 100,000 per day.
The country, however, remains one of the region's poorest economies and a cheap destination for both manufacturing and service sector outsourcing. Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) are among players to have followed Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) in planning to pour more money into its economy this year.
After outflows earlier in the year, portfolio investment appears to be following, betting that a growing middle class in the world's single largest consumer base outside China will drive future corporate returns.
""Recent reforms like the opening of coal and mining sector, import substitution and measures to incentivize domestic manufacturing for defense are expected to help the economy recover,"" said Sandip Khetan, a partner at consultancy EY.
With investors globally flush with the billions of extra funds pumped through the financial system to ease this year's dramatic downturn, BNP's Raychaudhuri said the diverse range of stocks investable in Mumbai also helped.
""Most other Asian peer markets do not offer investors such a diverse array of sectors to choose from,"" he said.

228,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 07, 2020 05:55AM ET</span>","Don't stop us paying dividends, European insurers tell regulators","LONDON (Reuters) - Global regulators should not ban insurers from paying dividends as a result of COVID-19 and should give firms more time to report their capital positions, European insurers said on Monday. 
The pandemic will likely lead to between $50 and $100 billion in losses for insurers, the Insurance Europe trade body said in response to a consultation by the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS) on the impact of the pandemic.
""A certain level of supervisory flexibility is ... crucial to enable insurers to adapt their products and services to new market realities,"" Insurance Europe said.
Insurers also have a responsibility to their shareholders and ""supervisors should refrain from imposing country or regional blanket bans on dividends,"" it added.
The EU's European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) has told insurers it was ""prudent"" to suspend dividends as a result of the crisis.
The Bank of England has also told UK insurers to think hard before paying dividends given the uncertainties associated with COVID.
However, major insurers such as Allianz (DE:ALVG) have continued to pay them. German financial regulator BaFin has also said a general payout ban is not necessary.
Insurers also need more time for financial reporting as they grapple with paying claims and developing new products, Insurance Europe said.
Insurers are facing legal action in several countries after they have said business interruption policies did not cover the pandemic. This had caused ""reputational damage"", Insurance Europe said.
The Solvency II EU capital rules for insurers exaggerate short-term market moves and ""failed to provide sufficient protection for some insurers and created exaggerated changes in the solvency position of others"" in the virus-triggered sell-off in March, Insurance Europe said. 

However, insurers' capital positions remained well above regulatory minimum levels, it added.

SEOUL (Reuters) - Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) has decided to cease production at its only TV factory in China by the end of November, a spokesman said on Monday, the latest in a series of moves by the South Korean firm to shift production from the world's second-largest economy. 
The TV factory in Tianjin is the only Samsung Electronics TV production base in China, the spokesman said. The decision is part of ""ongoing efforts to enhance efficiency"" in its production facilities, Samsung said in a statement earlier. 
The factory has about 300 workers, Yonhap news agency reported on Monday. Samsung declined to comment on the number of workers, but said some of the workers and equipment are expected to be retained. 
The latest exit leaves Samsung Electronics in China with a home appliance factory in Suzhou and chip production facilities in Suzhou and Xian. 
The decision follows Samsung Electronics' display unit confirming separately last week that it is selling off a majority stake in its Suzhou liquid crystal display (LCD) production unit to TCL Technology Group Corp's (SZ:000100) Star Optoelectronics Technology unit. 
Samsung Display said in March it decided to end all of its production of LCD panels in South Korea and China by the end of this year.

In August, Samsung said it will halt operations of its last computer factory in China.

230,By Investing.com,"<span>Sep 07, 2020 05:35AM ET</span>",StockBeat: Johnson's New Brexit Gambit Fails to Shake FTSE,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- A Hard Brexit is coming, and neither stocks nor even the pound seems to care. 
According to a report in the Financial Times on Monday, the U.K. government is drafting new legislation that would essentially rip up the EU Withdrawal Agreement governing the current transition period, putting the U.K. back on course for a hard border between the British province of Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland to the south. Prime Minister Boris Johnson is also telling local media that a trade deal to govern relations between the U.K. and EU effectively has to be done by October 15, accelerating a deadline that is currently set for the end of the year.
As a result, the pound has weakened against the euro, but not by much. It was down 0.6% at 1.1138. However, U.K. government bonds were higher, pushing yields down by one or two basis points along the curve, while the stock market could simply not have cared less: the FTSE 100 rose by 1.5% and the more domestically-focused FTSE 250 midcap index - which has traditionally been a better proxy for Brexit risk than the multinational-dominated FTSE 100 - rose 1.4%.
Evidently, the markets have tired of a narrative which has for four years promised an economic disaster and hardship that have stubbornly failed to arrive.
While it's true that the British economy has given up most of its relative outperformance of the euro zone in the first half of the last decade, such nuances have been lost in the all-engulfing and much more real economic disaster that has followed the Covid-19 lockdowns.  U.K. stocks have underperformed the rest of Europe this year: both the main FTSE boards are down by over 20% compared to 12% for the Stoxx 600, but that is largely explained by the country's poor handling of the coronavirus, and by the fact that its services-heavy economy was more vulnerable to the disruption of lockdowns (conspicuously, the only major index to underperform the U.K. this year is Spain's IBEX 35, which suffers from the same problems).
So why should the markets care any more about Brexit? 
The obvious answer is because its ability to cause real, additional economic disruption both to the U.K. and European economy haven't gone away. The U.K. has not found a way to track customs shipments that would remove the need for border checks, nor will the infrastructure that will be needed for such checks be ready by January, when the Withdrawal Agreement expires. 
Secondly, the scare scenarios implied in the gestures and negotiating tactics currently being used by both sides carry the risk of crystallizing if either side negotiates itself into a corner. The U.K. is betting on the EU's inability to take hard decisions with immediate and negative consequences, gambling that the Covid-19 recession will make countries like France and Germany even more reluctant to sacrifice a dominant position in the U.K. market on the altar of single market purism. The problem with that logic is that, apart from some contingency planning by central banks and regulators to avoid finance streams being disrupted, there is still no evidence to support it, even after four years.
Today's FT story makes for a good headline, but is not really any departure from the logic that Boris Johnson has advanced consistently for four years.Such haggling isn't pretty when viewed up close, and the new legislation certainly exposes the U.K. to accusations of bad faith from Brussels. But it is not enough to shake the prevailing belief that some kind of messy compromise will be avoided at the last minute. After all, that's how Europe has always worked. Sterling and U.K. stocks are already heavily discounted for Brexit risks. The real risk, from the market point of view, is being wrong-footed when - rather than if - that last-minute compromise comes."

(Reuters) - European shares bounced on Monday after a Wall Street-led rout in technology stocks kept global sentiment subdued in the previous week, with investors keeping a close watch on COVID-19 vaccine developments.
Australia expects to receive its first batches of a potential COVID-19 vaccine in January after a deal was struck with CSL (AX:CSL) to manufacture two vaccines, one developed by rival AstraZeneca (L:AZN) and Oxford University, and another in CSL's own labs with the University of Queensland.
AstraZeneca rose 1.6%, with the European healthcare sector index (SXDP) jumping 1.1%.
Sanofi (PA:SASY) rose 1% after it said a coronavirus vaccine it is developing with Britain's GlaxoSmithKline (L:GSK) was likely to be priced at less than 10 euros.
The STOXX 600 index (STOXX) was 1% higher, with Frankfurt shares (GDAXI) leading gains after rising 1.2%.
Autos (SXAP) led sectoral gains in Europe after analysts at JP Morgan said the overall tone for production outlook in the European autos sector was ""upbeat"", following its meetings with industry leaders.
Insurers (SXIP) and financial services sub-indexes climbed in early trading, while telecoms (SXKP) rose the least, suggesting a risk-on mood.
The STOXX 600 has remained stuck in a tight range since June, as a euro zone economic recovery appeared to be losing steam.
A batch of middling economic data last week bolstered expectations the ECB would maintain an accommodative stance to support inflation, in line with the U.S. Federal Reserve.
""Liquidity and low interest rates alone cannot be the solution to everything, so it's essential to see continued improvement in economic data and an end to the pandemic for sustainable upside in risk assets,"" said Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at FXTM.
Data showed German industrial output rose far less than expected in July, suggesting Europe's largest economy faces a slow return to production levels that preceded the crisis unleashed by the coronavirus pandemic.
""German industry eked out a meagre increase in production in July, leaving output still well below its pre-crisis level. Production is likely to have increased again in August, but we now seem to be past the period of rapid catch-up growth,"" said Jack Allen-Reynolds, senior Europe economist at Capital Economics.
European banks (SX7P) turned flat following a strong opening, after a rally last week on M&A negotiations between  Bankia  (MC:BKIA) and Caixabank (MC:CABK).
Dechra (L:DPH) jumped 9%, to the top of STOXX 600, after its profit beat expectations.

233,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 07, 2020 03:50AM ET</span>",Cheap seats give Chinese airlines a much-needed passenger bounce,"By Stella Qiu and Jamie Freed
BEIJING/SYDNEY (Reuters) - Looking to travel from Beijing to Hangzhou in eastern China? A flight can be had for as low as 180 yuan ($26) - one of a slew of deals fuelling a robust recovery in Chinese passenger levels and which could provide a model for a beleaguered industry globally.
Led by China Eastern Airlines (NYSE:CEA) Corp's (SS:600115) June offer of unlimited weekend flights until Dec. 31 for 3,322 yuan ($485), domestic carriers have fallen over themselves to woo passengers back with bargain-basement fares. At the same time, China's success in mitigating the spread of the coronavirus has helped consumers regain the confidence to travel.
Although the airlines are still loss-making and analysts say the recovery for China's aviation market is fragile and subject to setbacks, the cheap airfare strategy is far more cost-effective than having planes grounded. It also provides a model for other countries to borrow from or even top.
""We may have reached the point where some airlines begin to pay for some people to travel, offering free seats and then seeking to generate ancillary revenues that support the service whilst at the same time rebuilding traveller confidence,"" John Grant, OAG chief analyst said on his firm's website.
Vietnamese budget carrier VietJet Aviation JSC (HM:VJC) has come close to doing that, offering fares for next year's Lunar New Year holiday from 2,021 dong (9 U.S. cents) on all flights from north and central Vietnam to the country's south.
In the United States too, radical moves are being made.
The country's major airlines last week indefinitely scrapped booking change and cancellation fees. While undermining the pricing model for business travellers who pay a premium for flexibility in ticket changes, the move aims to rekindle domestic demand that in July was 73% below 2019 levels. 
In the United States and Europe where COVID-19 case numbers are much higher, airlines are still slashing their forward schedules and business travel remains at anaemic levels, according to data from OAG.
BOUNCING BACK 
In contrast, Chinese capacity has snapped back to more than 90% of pre-pandemic levels due in part to a summer travel boom, OAG says. It is expected to recover to last year's levels by the end of 2020, according to industry forecasts. 
China Southern Airlines (SS:600029), the carrier with the biggest domestic market share, even returned to year-on-year capacity growth in August. (Graphic: Chinese airline capacity, https://graphics.reuters.com/HEALTH-CORONAVIRUS/AIRLINES-RECOVERY/gjnpwarqopw/chart.png) 
Analysts stress, however, any pricing strategy will only work if consumers have enough confidence to fly, noting that New Zealand and Vietnam - both coronavirus mitigation success stories - had had strong domestic airline activity, only to see capacity levels drop after new outbreaks.
""For airlines and the travel industry outside China looking on with envy, there are some building blocks that could be emulated to drive some success in recovery amidst the pandemic. But it starts with effectively containing and suppressing the virus,"" Derek Sadubin, managing director at CAPA Centre for Aviation, said at his firm's Australia Pacific conference last week.
Even if planes are becoming fuller, Chinese airlines are still a long way from profitable, with the country's top three carriers logging a combined loss of around $1.8 billion in the April-June quarter.
Morningstar analyst Ivan Su expects domestic passenger yields for Air China (SS:601111) to slide 20% this year while yields for China Southern are forecast to drop 19% and China Eastern's are likely to fall 15%.

Strict limits on international flights have also led Chinese airlines to start deploying grounded widebody jets on domestic routes to stem their cash burn, raising the risk that a jump in capacity could place further pressure on fares.

Denmark has long sought to brand itself as one of the world’s greenest countries. So it may come as a surprise that it’s also one of the most expensive places on Earth to buy Teslas and other electric cars.
Under existing Danish law, a Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) model 3 Long Range will cost almost $100,000 next year (with all the trimmings); more than a fifth of that price tag comes from an extra tax, according to data compiled by Berlingske.
On Monday, a government-appointed panel is due to present its recommendations for how to shift Danish buyers over to electric cars and away from petrol-powered vehicles. Proposals are expected to include lower overall auto taxes; instead, Danes face new road and emissions taxes.
Denmark collects about 50 billion kroner ($8 billion) annually in taxes from car sales. A majority in parliament has signaled a willingness to accept lower revenues if it means more consumers can afford electric cars.
Green Dreams
The Social Democrat government has staked its reputation on pushing through legislation that represents a paradigm shift in terms of protecting the environment. In June, lawmakers struck an historic deal to cut carbon emissions by 70% by 2030, from 1990 levels.
Denmark Strikes Historic Climate Deal to Slash Emissions
To reach that goal, which is considerably more ambitious than the European Union’s 40% target over the same period, more Danes need to buy cars that pollute less.
But there’s a very long way to go. Though electric-vehicle sales have risen, they still make up less than 1% of the country’s 2.7 million registered vehicles, according to the Association of Danish Car Importers.

Investing.com - European stock markets pushed higher Monday, despite lackluster German economic data, with focus turning to Thursday’s meeting of the European Central Bank.
At 3:35 AM ET (0735 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.8% higher, the CAC 40 in France rose 0.7% and the U.K.'s FTSE index was up 0.8%. Volumes are likely to be affected by Monday’s U.S. Labor Day holiday.
Earlier Monday, German industrial output disappointed, climbing just 1.2% in July, below the 4.7% increase expected. 
The release ""leaves us with a picture of a German manufacturing sector that is still far off making a full recovery. As of July, production remained 11% below its pre-virus level,"" said Claus Vistesen of Pantheon Macroeconomics in a research note. ""The good news is that headline leading indicators suggest that the upturn will be sustained,"" he added.
A release from the Ifo institute had suggested on Monday that German industrial firms expect production to increase slightly in the coming months.
""The industrial sector - the engine of Germany's economy - is gradually getting back on track,"" Klaus Wohlrabe, who runs surveys at Ifo, said in a statement. The Ifo indicator - not to be confused with its better-known business climate index - rose to 15.4 points in August from 14.3 points in July.
Away from Germany, the most important release due later Monday will be Spanish consumer confidence, which is due at 6:30 AM ET (1030 GMT).
This brings Thursday’s policy meeting at the European Central Bank firmly into focus. While the central bank is expected to keep policy steady, there will be a fresh set of economic projections to digest. Additionally, after the recent Federal Reserve announcement, there may also be interest in the ECB’s own strategy review.
“The Fed’s decision to move to an average inflation target has set the scene,” said ING’s Carsten Brzeski, in a research note published late last week. “We don’t expect any insights in the ECB’s strategy next week. It is hard to believe that Christine Lagarde will want to preempt the discussion which has just started. In the end, however, we still see the ECB moving to a more symmetric target changing the definition of price stability to ‘around 2%’.”
In corporate news, AB Foods (LON:ABF) stock rose 1.9% after the U.K.-based retailer said that trading in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 beat its expectations for both its flagship Primark brand and its food businesses.
Oil prices dropped Monday, hitting their lowest levels since July, after Saudi Arabia, the world’s top oil exporter, cut its October official selling price for the Arab Light crude it sells to Asia by the biggest margin since May. 
The market remains oversupplied despite the efforts of the top producers to rein in production as demand still remains curtailed by the impact of the coronavirus pandemic.
U.S. crude futures traded 1.6% lower at $39.15 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract fell 1.4% to $42.06.
Elsewhere, gold futures rose 0.2% to $1,937.15/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% higher at 1.1841.

DBJ and Nissan declined to comment. The Ministry of Finance could not immediately be reached for comment.
Three other sources told Reuters in May the government would guarantee part of a loan from Mizuho Financial Group Inc (T:8411), aimed at helping Nissan ride out the COVID-19 pandemic. 
The two guarantees, if confirmed, would put the government on the hook to the tune of 304 billion yen, or 43% of the total loans Nissan has secured from its main lenders to weather the COVID-19 pandemic, Reuters calculations show.
Nissan has also secured 120 billion yen from Mitsubishi UFJ (NYSE:MUFG) Financial Group (T:8306) and 50 billion yen from Sumitomo Mitsui (NYSE:SMFG) Financial Group (T:8316), the sources previously told Reuters. The government has not guaranteed any portion of these loans, the sources said.

Nissan had pledged to slice 300 billion yen from annual fixed costs and become a smaller, more efficient company after the pandemic exacerbated a slide in profitability that culminated in its first annual loss since fiscal 2008 in the year ended March.

TOKYO (Reuters) - SoftBank Group Corp closed down 7% as the conglomerate's bets on equity derivatives tied to listed technology companies made investors uncomfortable amid a decline in markets. 
Shares fell below 6,000 yen for the first time in two months to 5,881 yen. The group was the biggest loser in percentage terms on the benchmark index, which closed down 0.5%. 
The Japanese financial powerhouse has spent billions of dollars buying shares in technology companies such as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) as it parks cash generated by a massive asset sale programme.
The group has also made significant options purchases in tech companies, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters, in an aggressive bet by Chief Executive Masayoshi Son on rising tech stocks.
Options of $4 billion generated an exposure of about $50 billion, the Wall Street Journal reported. The group has made $4 billion in trading gains from those bets, the Financial Times reported.
SoftBank has previously declined to comment on the trades. 
The group frequently hedges its exposure and it is unclear how much profit will be delivered by the trades, which underscore Son's undiminished risk appetite even as some analysts warn of sky-high valuations. 
""When there is a tech bubble, Masayoshi Son is usually not too far away from the action,"" Amir Anvarzadeh, market strategist at Asymmetric Advisors, wrote in a note. 
Another Japanese billionaire, Yusaku Maezawa, who sold his online fashion retailer Zozo Inc to SoftBank last year, said on Twitter he had been ""dazzled"" by the markets and lost 4.4 billion yen ($41 million) betting on stocks. 
SoftBank's shares have been boosted by a record share buyback in recent months but the group has indicated those purchases will slow, providing less support for the stock.

Investing.com - European stock markets are seen opening mixed Monday, with the German market underperforming after weak economic data. However, trading ranges are seen limited given the U.S. holiday and the approach of Thursday’s meeting of the European Central Bank.
At 2:05 AM ET (0605 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.3% lower, CAC 40 futures in France climbed 0.6%, while the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. rose 0.4%. 
Earlier Monday, German industrial output disappointed, climbing just 1.2% in July, below the 4.7% increase expected. 
This release surprised the market after a release from the Ifo institute had suggested on Monday that German industrial firms expect production to increase slightly in the coming months.
""The industrial sector - the engine of Germany's economy - is gradually getting back on track,"" Klaus Wohlrabe, who runs surveys at Ifo, said in a statement. The Ifo indicator - not to be confused with its better-known business climate inde - rose to 15.4 points in August from 14.3 points in July.
Earlier Monday, data from China painted a mixed picture of the recovery by the second-largest economy in the world. China's exports rose for the third consecutive month in August, climbing 9.5% from a year earlier, the strongest gain since March 2019. On the flip side, imports slumped 2.1%. In part, that was a reflection of slower stockpiling after aggressive buying of industrial commodities, especially oil, in July.
Still, volumes are likely to be limited and trading ranges tight in Europe Monday, with the important U.S. market closed for the Labor Day holiday, particularly after the dominant tech sector showed signs of weakness towards the end of last week.
“Risk assets remain fragile following Thursday’s tech-led rout and volatility spike … with stimulus having been key for supporting equities and such lofty valuations, its renewal will be crucial not only for the recovery, but as a driver for equities as job risks mount,” Medley Global Advisors managing director for global macro strategy Ben Emons told Bloomberg.
Investors will also be wary ahead of Thursday’s policy meeting at the European Central Bank. While the central bank is expected to keep policy steady, there will be a fresh set of economic projections to digest. Additionally, after the recent Federal Reserve announcement, there may also be interest in the ECB’s own strategy review.
Oil prices dropped Monday, hitting their lowest levels since July, after Saudi Arabia, the world’s top oil exporter, cut its October official selling price for the Arab Light crude it sells to Asia by the biggest margin since May. 
The market remains oversupplied despite the efforts of the top producers to rein in production as demand still remains curtailed by the impact of the coronavirus pandemic.
U.S. crude futures traded 1.8% lower at $39.04 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract fell 1.6% to $42.00.
Elsewhere, gold futures rose 0.1% to $1,935.80/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% lower at 1.1830."

Investing.com – Asian stocks were mostly down on Monday morning, with markets slowly recovering from the biggest two-day slide since June and investors digesting data released by China.
China’s Shanghai Composite inched down 0.09% by 11:20 PM ET (4:20 AM GMT) and the Shenzhen Component fell 1.10%. The country released mixed export and import data for August earlier in the day, with exports up 9.5% year-on-year from July’s 7.2% increase but imports down 2.1% year-on-year, more than July’s 1.4% fall. The trade balance decreased to $58.93 billion, down from the previous month’s $62.33 billion.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 edged down 0.18%, ahead of a slew of economic data to be released on Tuesday, including figures on household spending, the current account and the gross domestic product.
Some investors also expected more stimulus measures before the end of the year and expected incumbent prime minister Shinzo Abe’s Abenomics policy to be continued by his replacement.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index edged up 0.19%, reversing its earlier losses. Police reportedly made 289 arrests in the aftermath of protests that took place in the city on Sunday, the original date of the Legislative Council elections. The elections have been postponed to 2021 due to COVID-19.
South Korea’s KOSPI rose 0.64%.
Australia’s ASX 200 inched down 0.02%. Australian biotechnology company CSL Ltd (ASX:CSL) said earlier in the day that it would manufacture a COVID-19 vaccine candidate being developed by AstraZeneca (NYSE:AZN) and Oxford University upon the completion of successful trials. The first doses for Australian are expected by early 2021.
CSL will also develop a second vaccine candidate, which it is developing alongside the University of Queensland, with the first doses also expected by mid-2021.
But some investors remained cautious over the global recovery from Thursday’s slide.
“Risk assets remain fragile following Thursday’s tech-led rout and volatility spike … with stimulus having been key for supporting equities and such lofty valuations, its renewal will be crucial not only for the recovery, but as a driver for equities as job risks mount,” Medley Global Advisors managing director for global macro strategy Ben Emons told Bloomberg.
Meanwhile, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Sunday said a deal between the White House and Congress would finalize details on a spending bill by the end of the week and fund the federal government through the beginning of December, boosting investor hopes that a shutdown will be averted.
Mnuchin and U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi have reportedly agreed to extend funding, with the measure set to avert a government shutdown when current funding dries up at the end of the month.
“We’re going to move forward with a clean continuing resolution, hopefully through the beginning of December,” Mnuchin said adding: “I hope by the end of the week we’ll have something firmed up.”"

The contract was finalized Friday and is valid from June 30 through December 2025, it said in a regulatory filing.
The deal marks one of Samsung’s biggest 5G contracts since Korea’s largest corporation decided years ago to invest in networking and compete with global players like Nokia (NYSE:NOK) and Ericsson (BS:ERICAs) in providing telecom equipment. It should lift Samsung’s market share in the wireless industry at a time leader Huawei Technologies Co. is grappling with U.S. sanctions and Washington’s effort to get allies around the world to shut out the Chinese company.

“With this latest long-term strategic contract, we will continue to push the boundaries of 5G innovation to enhance mobile experiences for Verizon’s customers,” the company said in an emailed statement.
Samsung (KS:005930), the world’s largest memory chip and electronics gadget maker, has been pushing hard to expand its market share in the 5G equipment market and investing in sixth-generation mobile networks. The company didn’t provide further details about the Verizon deal. The U.S. carrier gained much-needed mid-band spectrum for its 5G rollout after emerging among the top winners in a recent U.S. auction of airwaves.

SEOUL (Reuters) - Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) said on Monday it had won a $6.64 billion order to provide wireless communication solutions to Verizon (N:VZ) in the United States, a major win for the South Korean firm in the next-generation 5G network market. 
Samsung's global prospects for its network business have improved following U.S. sanctions on its bigger rival Huawei, analysts said. 
Verizon CEO Hans Vestberg told CNBC in July last year that Verizon does not use any Huawei equipment. Verizon had already been a Samsung customer before the order. 
Verizon is believed to be Nokia’s (HE:NOKIA) biggest customer, JP Morgan research said in a July note. 
""Samsung winning the order from Verizon would help the company expand its telecom equipment business abroad, potentially giving leverage to negotiate with other countries,” said Park Sung-soon, an analyst at Cape Investment and Securities. 
The order is for network equipment, a Samsung spokesman said. The company declined to comment on detailed terms the contract such as the portion of 5G-capable equipment included.
""With this latest long-term strategic contract, we will continue to push the boundaries of 5G innovation to enhance mobile experiences for Verizon’s customers,"" Samsung said in a statement. 
Samsung said in a regulatory filing the period of the contract, which Samsung's U.S. unit signed with Verizon Sourcing LLC, is from June 30, 2020 to Dec. 31, 2025. 
Samsung had a 3% market share of the global total telecom equipment market in 2019, behind No. 1 Huawei with 28%, Nokia (NYSE:NOK)'s 16%, Ericsson's (ST:ERICb) 14%, ZTE (HK:0763)'s (SZ:000063) 10% and Cisco's (O:CSCO) 7%, according to market research firm Dell'Oro Group. 
The Trump administration last month unveiled plans to auction off spectrum previously dedicated to military purposes for commercial use starting in mid-2022, to ramp up fifth-generation network coverage in the United States.
The next-generation 5G wireless network is expected eventually to connect and enable high-speed video transmissions and self-driving cars, among other uses.
Britain in July ordered Huawei equipment to be purged completely from its 5G network by the end of 2027, adding it needs to bring in new suppliers like Samsung Electronics and Japan's NEC (T:6701).

Samsung Electronics shares rose 2% compared to the wider KOSPI's 0.5% climb.

Unit 5 at China National Nuclear Corp.’s Fuqing power station received the license, which allows it to begin loading fuel, the Ministry of Ecology & Environment, said in a statement Friday.
The development of Hualong One reactor technology is being closely watched in the battle for the nation’s next-generation nuclear power systems. Its success could mean a nuclear revival in China that would have little to do with western developers including Westinghouse Electric Co. from the U.S. and France’s Electricite de France SA (PA:EDF).
China had almost 49 gigawatts of nuclear power installed as of 2019 and should get into the mid-fifties this year. GlobalData Plc predicts it will pass France as the world’s No. 2 nuclear generator in 2022 and claim the top spot from the U.S. four years after that.
Beijing gave the green light to four Hualong One reactors last year in a clear sign of support, ending a three-year freeze on new approvals caused by the government’s consideration of different technologies and the ongoing trade dispute with the U.S. Two more Hualong One reactors were approved last week.
The country started up the world’s first next-generation reactors in 2018, including four AP1000 units designed by Westinghouse as well as a project using EDF’s EPR technology.

243,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 06, 2020 08:10PM ET</span>",Death knell sounds for some of Japan's oldest department stores,"By Ritsuko Ando and Leika Kihara
TOKYO (Reuters) - After more than three centuries in business, the Onuma department store in northern Japanese city of Yamagata began bankruptcy proceedings this year - one of many distinguished department stores across the country in dire straits.
Known for fancy food halls, luxury items, impeccable service and, in their heyday, rooftop attractions to entertain families, Japan's department stores have been in a long slow decline as shopping habits change. 
Now the coronavirus pandemic, just as it has forced U.S. retailers such as Lord & Taylor and Neiman Marcus into bankruptcy, is hammering nails into coffins for some - particularly those in regional areas.
Last month, 146-year-old Nakago closed the doors of its last remaining store in Fukushima city, also in the north, while  Izutsuya Co Ltd  (T:8260), a chain in the southern city of Kita Kyushu, shuttered one of its two main stores.
""Everyone agrees it's very disappointing, but the truth is that people haven't been shopping at these stores lately,"" said Shuhei Yamashita, a retail consultant who hopes to buy the Onuma department store from creditors and turn it around.
This year, with consumers wary of shopping and tourism decimated amid the pandemic, sales have plunged. Industry sales dropped by a fifth in July from a year earlier and policymakers fear more store closures and bankruptcies are inevitable.
Even before this year's woes, Japanese department stores have struggled to stay relevant, selling items such as $10,000 kimonos and posh tableware to maintain their cachet even as consumer tastes have turned towards more informal items. At the same time, consumers have taken much of their shopping online. 
Both industry-wide sales and store numbers have tumbled 30% since 1999. Some of the country's 203 department stores have also drastically shrunk floor space by bringing in other tenants. 
Big national chains and stores in major cities haven't been immune. Isetan Mitsukoshi Holdings Ltd (T:3099), for example, has closed several stores over the past decade and said in March it would close a Mitsukoshi store in downtown Tokyo next year.
However, it is the prospects for regional stores and the implications for their local economies - already wracked by decades of deflation, anaemic growth and an exodus of young people searching for better jobs - which are causing the most concern.
Policymakers fret store failures may sow seeds of crisis, exacerbating pain felt throughout a local economy to the point that beleaguered regional lenders will not be able to cope with increases in non-performing loans.
""Closures will weigh on property prices, jobs and many other aspects of an already weakening regional economy,"" said a government official with expertise in regional finance, speaking on condition of anonymity.
Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga, the frontrunner to become the country's new prime minister this month, has made revitalising regional economies a key policy priority. 
But whether any of the government's pledge of $2.2 trillion in stimulus for pandemic-hit companies finds its way to department stores remains an open question with some government officials and politicians privately saying that the money needs to be funnelled towards more viable industries.
EVERYTHING HAS CHANGED
In Yamagata, the future of the Onuma department store remains unclear. Although Yamashita's company is keen to keep the store going, creditors could opt to sell to a higher-paying bidder.
Some locals seem resigned to Onuma's failure, saying it had failed to keep up with changing lifestyles including the rise of online retailers and faster transport links to bigger cities.
""Infrastructure, transportation, lifestyles, information, culture, values - everything has changed,"" Takashi Inoue, president of a metal processing company in Yamagata, wrote in a blog as he lamented Onuma's bankruptcy.
For now, Yamashita's company is helping to keep the store open through the end of September, although the food hall is closed and shoppers are limited to browsing for deals among household items and clothes he has gathered from various warehouses.
Still, Yamashita isn't giving up hope that creditors will be convinced by his plans to revamp the store.

""It's a place people once loved,"" he said. ""It will be a shame if it becomes just another high-rise development.""

MELBOURNE (Reuters) - A discovery of ancient artefacts on the seabed off Australia's west coast has opened up a new frontier for resource companies to watch out for in conserving indigenous heritage.
Archaeologists in July reported they had found hundreds of stone tools submerged off the Dampier Archipelago in Western Australia, showing evidence of people living in the area when it was dry land more than 7,000 years ago.
The two sites are about 5 km (3 miles) east of where Woodside (OTC:WOPEY) Petroleum, Australia's top independent gas producer, plans to build a pipeline connecting its Scarborough gas field to its Pluto gas plant on the Burrup Peninsula.
The company is speaking to archaeologists involved in the Deep History of Sea Country, which made the discoveries, and the Murujuga Aboriginal Corp (MAC), the indigenous land owners in that region, about its pipeline route.
""We are concerned there is potential for submerged heritage to be impacted, regardless of whether it has been discovered or is yet to be discovered,"" Peter Jeffries, chief executive of MAC, told Reuters in emailed comments.
""We believe a thorough investigation of these areas needs to be conducted before any decision can be made.""
Woodside has long worked with the Murujuga to preserve rock art sites near its North West Shelf and Pluto LNG plants on the Burrup Peninsula.
The company said it recognises there is potential for submerged heritage to exist and has done extensive archaeology and ethnographic cultural heritage and geotechnical surveys onshore and nearshore.
The surveys identified one coastal archaeological site within the Pluto LNG foundation lease area which the company said remains intact and protected, a Woodside spokeswoman said.
""This is the first time in Australia that submerged heritage is being considered -- for the Scarborough pipeline near shore,"" Woodside Chief Executive Peter Coleman told Reuters last month.
The company is talking to MAC about developing a cultural heritage management plan for Scarborough and a dredging and spoil disposal management plan, Woodside's spokeswoman said.
Woodside hopes to make a final investment decision in 2021 on the $11 billion Scarborough project, a joint venture with BHP Group (NYSE:BHP).
THIN LEGAL PROTECTION
Australia's indigenous heritage laws came under fire after global miner Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO) legally destroyed two caves in the Juukan Gorge in Western Australia which showed evidence of 46,000 years of human habitation. 
Underwater, Australian law protects shipwrecks and sunken aircraft as cultural heritage, but only protects submerged indigenous artefacts and sites if a minister determines that they are significant.
""At the moment, a 75-year-old shipwreck is automatically protected on discovery, but 8,000-year-old evidence of Indigenous cultural heritage is not. This could allow a tragic destruction of important heritage, similar to the Juukan Gorge situation,"" Jeffries said.
Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association Chief Executive Andrew McConville said the oil and gas industry takes underwater heritage seriously.
The Rio Tinto case has raised issues around what the public deems acceptable, sparking a Senate inquiry into heritage protection.
""We don't need the law to tell us what the right thing to do is. We're already doing it,"" Coleman said.
Jonathan Benjamin, leader of the Deep History of Sea Country project, who led the finds off Western Australia, welcomed Woodside engaging with archaeologists and said he hoped the oil and gas industry would be more proactive in surveying nearshore areas that were once dry land.

""There's a huge amount of knowledge to be found on Australia's seabed around the country. It's not about one spot.""

The SEC is probing allegations made by Richard Bowley, a British national who worked for the company's copper business in Mongolia between 2017 and 2019, the newspaper said, citing people with knowledge of the situation.
The U.S regulator has not yet decided to launch an investigation, the newspaper added.
In July, Rio Tinto said it cut estimated reserves at its underground copper mine extension of Oyu Tolgoi and confirmed it would face delays and higher costs after ground instability forced it to redesign the mine plan.
Oyu Tolgoi (OT) is Rio's biggest copper growth project but has faced geological challenges.

BERLIN (Reuters) - Chancellor Angela Merkel on Sunday faced growing pressure to reconsider Germany's Nord Stream 2 pipeline project with Russia following the suspected poisoning of Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny.
Defence Minister Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer said the question of sanctions on the pipeline, which will bring gas from Russia to Germany, rested on Moscow's cooperation in clearing up what exactly happened to Navalny.
Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said suspicion would fall on Russia if it failed to help resolve the matter. 
Navalny was airlifted to Germany for hospital treatment after falling ill on a Russian domestic flight last month. The German government says he was poisoned with a Novichok nerve agent similar to the one used in an attempt to kill a former Russian spy in England two years ago.
Moscow says it has seen no evidence he was poisoned.
""I have always said that I am not fond of the Nord Stream 2 project,"" Kramp-Karrenbauer said. ""To me it was always clear that the security interests of Eastern European states and Ukraine must be taken into consideration.""
Pressed on whether Germany was ready to sanction the project, Kramp-Karranbauer said: ""What happens now depends on the behavior of the Russian side.""
Foreign Minister Maas of the Social Democratic Party (SPD), junior partners in Merkel's coalition government, said in remarks published on Sunday that a failure by Moscow to help to clear up the circumstances of Navalny's illness would add to suspicions that Russia's government was involved.
""I certainly hope that the Russians will not force us to change our position on Nord Stream 2,"" he told the Bild am Sonntag newspaper.
The affair has led to calls from several leading conservatives for Merkel to suspend the pipeline, a huge, nearly complete project to bring Russian gas to Germany under the sea.

Merkel, a supporter of the pipeline, has said it should not be linked to the Navalny case.

""The price is not totally set ... We are assessing production costs for the coming months ... We will be below 10 euros,"" Olivier Bogillot told France Inter radio.
Drugmakers and government agencies are racing to come up with vaccines for the new coronavirus and treatments for COVID-19, the respiratory diseases it causes which has killed more than 879,000 worldwide and wrecked economies.
Asked about rival AstraZeneca (L:AZN), which is expected to price its shot at about 2.50 euros in Europe, Bogillot said: ""The price gap for us can be that we use all our internal resources, our own researchers, our own research centres. AstraZeneca outsources part of its production.""
A Sanofi spokeswoman said in an emailed statement on Sunday that a final price would only be decided when the vaccine reaches its final testing stage.
""We anticipate being able to determine a final price at the time of our Phase III trials, when we know more about dosing. At this stage, any figure is imprecise. Less than 10 euros is only one of the hypotheses we are working on."" 
Earlier this week, Sanofi and GSK said they had started a clinical trial of their protein-based coronavirus vaccine candidate, with the ambition of reaching the final testing stage, also known as Phase III, by December.
If the results are positive, Sanofi and GSK hope to get the vaccine approved in the first half of next year.
Sanofi is also working on another coronavirus vaccine candidate with U.S group Translate Bio (O:TBIO) that will use another technology known as messenger RNA.

Switzerland's market watchdog, FINMA, opened an enforcement case on Wednesday over the spying scandal to examine the bank's culture and governance and whether management control failures allowed snooping on former executive board members.
Revelations of corporate espionage had rocked the discreet world of Swiss banking last year when it emerged that Credit Suisse had been spying on former wealth management boss Iqbal Khan, who was leaving for rival UBS (S:UBSG), and former human resources head Peter Goerke.
The bank had hoped that the departure of Thiam over the scandal and his replacement with Thomas Gottstein, a Credit Suisse veteran, would draw a line under the affair.
SonntagsZeitung, citing multiple sources familiar with the matter, said that two further instances had come to light. 
One was connected with an employee in Asia, who had made threats against other bank employees; and one was connected with a former high-level manager and an employee with whom the manager may have had intimate relations in the United States, SonntagsZeitung reported.
The paper cited one source as saying neither the bank's executive committee nor board of directors had been aware of the two instances.
A Credit Suisse spokesman declined to comment on the SonntagsZeitung report, referring to the bank's statement from Wednesday which said it was cooperating with FINMA and seeking to ""incorporate lessons learned"". It reiterated that spying was not part of its culture.
FINMA declined to comment on ongoing proceedings, referring to its statement from Wednesday, in which it said it will pursue indications of violations of supervisory law and, in particular, the question of how these activities were documented and controlled. 
Gottstein, who stepped in after Thiam left his role at the head of Switzerland's second-biggest bank in February, had said FINMA's ramp-up of proceedings had been expected after an auditor visited the bank in recent months.
Credit Suisse had tried to remove the FINMA-appointed auditor, Thomas Werlen, because his law firm Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan had been involved in legal cases against it.

Its appeal of a lower court decision backing his appointment is pending in the Swiss Federal Supreme Court.

Veolia last Sunday offered 2.9 billion euros ($3.4 billion), or 15.50 euros per share, for Engie's 29.9% stake in Suez as a prelude to launching a full takeover.
The blessing of the French government is key for any deal as the state holds a 23.6% in Engie.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) in July identified more than a dozen plant species ranging from morning glories to mustard in the bags of unsolicited seeds. It warned Americans not to plant the seeds.
According to plant experts, seeds from other parts of the world could be non-native varieties that harm commodity crops.
""Moving forward, we are only permitting the sale of seeds by sellers who are based in the U.S.,"" Amazon said in an emailed statement on Saturday. 
The company changed its policy on seed sales on Wednesday. The policy change was first reported by the Wall Street Journal.
The company added that sellers who do not follow its guidelines will be subject to action, including potential removal of their accounts.
According to Amazon's policy web page, the ban extends to plants and plant products.
The USDA in July said the packages were most likely part of a ""brushing"" scam, in which people receive unsolicited items from a seller who then posts false positive customer reviews to boost sales.

Germany's largest trade union IG Metall on Aug. 15 proposed negotiating for a transition to a four-day week across industry to help secure jobs, against the backdrop of economic fallout from the coronavirus crisis and structural shifts in the auto sector.
But VW labour chief Bernd Osterloh told Welt am Sonntag newspaper that VW's existing cost-cutting plan, that includes reducing the workforce by up to 7,000 through the early retirement of administrative staff at its Wolfsburg headquarters, was enough to help it overcome the coronavirus crisis and other issues. 
""At the moment we are not talking about less work,"" Osterloh said. ""With the Golf we had the (production) levels of last year in June and July and introduced extra shifts,"" he added, referring to one of the company's most popular models. 
""The four-day week is not an issue for us."" 
Demands by IG Metall, which represents 2.3 million employees in the metal working and electrical sectors, are potentially significant in Germany because they often set benchmarks for wage negotiations in those industries and beyond.

VW in 2016 set out a cost-reduction programme dubbed Future Pact, but the company has ruled out compulsory layoffs until 2025. Osterloh was quoted as saying in July that VW had no need for deeper cost cuts to counter the effects of COVID-19, which dealt a severe blow to car sales.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration is considering whether to add China's top chipmaker SMIC to a trade blacklist, a Defense Department official said, as the United States escalates its crackdown on Chinese companies. A Pentagon spokeswoman said the Defense Department was working with other agencies to determine whether to make the move against Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (HK:0981), which would force U.S. suppliers to seek a difficult-to-obtain license before shipping to the company.
SMIC said in a statement on Saturday it was ""in complete shock"" over the news but was open to communication with U.S. government agencies in hopes of resolving any misunderstandings. The Chinese Embassy in Washington did not respond to requests for comment.
Earlier this week, the Pentagon made a proposal to place SMIC on the entity list to the End User Committee, a panel led by the Commerce Department that also includes the State and Energy Departments and makes decisions about entity listings, a person familiar with the matter said. It was not clear whether the other agencies supported the plan. 
The Trump administration has often used the entity list - which now includes more than 275 China-based firms - to hit key Chinese industries, from telecoms equipment giants Huawei Technologies [HWT.UL] and ZTE (SZ:000063) over sanction violations, to surveillance camera maker Hikvision (SZ:002415) over suppression of China's Uighur minority.
SMIC is the largest Chinese chip manufacturer but is second-tier to rival Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TW:2330), the industry's market leader. It has sought to build out foundries for the manufacture of computer chips that can compete with TSMC.
But it is also facing new restrictions from Commerce that require Huawei's chip manufacturers to seek U.S. licenses before producing chips for the telecoms giant, if they rely on U.S. chipmaking technology. SMIC is one of Huawei's manufacturers.
U.S. companies including Lam Research (O:LRCX), KLA Corp (O:KLAC) and Applied Materials (O:AMAT), which supply key chipmaking equipment, could be impacted by a potential entity listing, industry sources said. 
While the Pentagon official did not outline the reasons for the action, SMIC's relationship to the Chinese military is under scrutiny, another U.S. official and two former officials briefed on the matter said. 
In Saturday's statement, SMIC said it had no ties to the Chinese military. 
The administration has increasingly trained its focus on Chinese companies that bolster Beijing's military. Last month, the United States blacklisted 24 Chinese companies and targeted individuals it said were part of construction and military actions in the South China Sea, its first such sanctions against Beijing over the disputed strategic waterway.
The Defense Department has released two lists of Chinese companies in the past few months that it claims are owned or controlled by the People's Liberation Army. The designation gives President Donald Trump the authority to place them on an even tougher blacklist but so far no action has been taken.

The U.S. government has urged allies to exclude Huawei from their next-generation communications infrastructure because it sees a risk the group could give China a strategic opening to spy on the West. Huawei rejects the charges.
Italy passed legislation last year giving the government special vetting powers over 5G supply deals between domestic firms and non-EU providers, including Huawei, but it has not gone as far as to ban the Chinese vendor.
Siding with Washington, Britain in July ordered telecoms operators to stop buying any 5G equipment from Huawei by the end of the year and demanded the network be purged of any existing gear from the Chinese provider by 2027.
Speaking to the media during the annual Ambrosetti forum on Lake Como, Telecom Italia (TIM) CEO Luigi Guibitosi ruled out a similar situation posing a challenge to TIM.
""If you're asking if I anticipate any problems were we to find ourselves in a situation like Britain's, the answer is no,"" Gubitosi said,
He said Huawei was just one of several providers TIM had, of which the main one was Sweden's Ericsson (ST:ERICb), while rivals Nokia (HE:NOKIA) and Huawei had a smaller role.
""We wouldn't have any trouble given time to manage the situation,"" he said.
In Germany, Deutsche Telekom (DE:DTEGn) has asked that no telecoms equipment vendor be barred, contrary to calls from some lawmakers to ban Huawei on national security grounds.
TIM in July left Huawei out of an invitation to tender for a contract to supply 5G equipment for core network infrastructure, where sensitive data is processed, in Italy and Brazil.

Instead he came up with his own version of the futuristic vehicle.
It took eight months for IT specialists and engineers at Igor Krezic's Stark Solutions company to disassemble a rugged Ford Raptor F-150 into its smallest parts and then transform it into petrol-powered vehicle that resembles a Cybertruck.
The first drive through the streets of the southern town of Mostar drew a lot of attention, Mario Coric, the company manager, told Reuters. 
""Everybody was watching and half of them thought we made a tank, because people don't know what the Cybertruck is. One girl even stopped and asked if this is the place where they are producing Tesla Cybertruck,"" Coric said on Friday.
Krezic declined to speak to Reuters.
Though it may not look identical to Cybertruck's functional prototype the pickup captures its spirit.
""The owner wanted us to combine two opposite sides -- Ford and Cyber -- because he is a fan of both Tesla and Ford, so we merged two souls into one,"" he said.
""This one uses gasoline and Tesla uses electricity. We tried to copy as much as possible but our car is not the same size as the Cybertruck,"" Coric added.
There was no immediate comment from Tesla and Ford.
Coric said Stark Solutions was now trying to register the pickup to be able to drive it on roads but they were encountering problems because sharp vehicle edges like those seen on the Cybertruck are banned in Bosnia.
Tesla plans to build its $1.1 billion Cybertruck factory near Austin, Texas, ending an intense competition with neighbouring Oklahoma, the carmaker's chief executive Musk announced in July.

With a starting price of $39,000, the Cybertruck resembles an armoured vehicle and takes aim at the heart of Detroit automakers' profitable truck business.

Investing.com -- With the U.S. dollar sinking and stock markets whipsawing, investors are hunting for ways to diversify.
And that's leading to a major jump in crypto interest, says Catherine Coley, chief executive officer of Binance.US, a digital asset marketplace, on Fortune.
How does one cautiously step into the world of digital currencies? If investors aren't ready to take the plunge and buy actual crypto quite yet, ETFs offer a way to play. But buyer beware: Unlike, gold, not all such ETFs are equal, and that can be seen in the performance of two of the best known, BLOK and BLCN.
Amplify Transformational Data Sharing (NYSE:BLOK) is actively managed by Toroso Investments.
""Some people believe it's the new gold,"" said Dan Weiskopf, a portfolio manager at Toroso who also goes by the Twitter handle @ETFProfessor. BLOK is a global equity portfolio of professionally-selected companies involved in the transformational data-sharing technology known as blockchain. Among the top holdings are GMO Internet,  Square Inc  (NYSE:SQ) and Z Holdings Corp (OTC:YAHOY). 
""We're not able to directly own crypto, but what we can do is identify those companies, like Square and Galaxy Digital, and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) as a chip maker and the miners that are going to be benefiting by the trend in crypto,"" Weiskopf said in a phone interview last month.
BLOK was launched in 2018, and is up 35% this year, compared to GLD (NYSE:GLD), up 29%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down slightly for 2020, and the S&P 500 is up 8.8%.
""It's very clear from headlines that we're seeing more evidence that people are really excited about owning more crypto,"" Weiskopf said. ""We may use dollars or banks to transfer money but there is no question that crypto is being used abroad.""
Reality Shares Nasdaq NexGen Economy (NASDAQ:BLCN) tracks the Reality Shares Nasdaq Blockchain Economy Index, created through a partnership between Reality Shares and Nasdaq. The index constitutes the research, analysis and investigation of both groups on the emerging development of blockchain technology. The Index is designed to measure the returns of companies that are committing material resources to developing, researching, supporting, innovating or utilizing blockchain technology for their use or for use by others.
Among its top holdings are  Overstock.com  (NASDAQ:OSTK), Square and DocuSign (NASDAQ:DOCU).  
Interestingly, not everyone is buying BLCN because of its blockchain theme.
""We rate these products not in relation to one another but prospects to the market,"" said Todd Rosenbluth, the senior director of ETF and mutual fund research at CFRA, in a phone interview last month. ""We like BLCN but not necessarily as a call on blockchain as an entity,"" pointing as an example to the fact that Overstock's business isn't driven by blockchain.
This subcategory of ETFs is a great example of why an investor can't just look at a ticker, Rosenbluth said. While the overall theme is connected, it is like comparing apples and oranges.
Still, blockchain has the potential to affect so many different industries, Weiskopf said. It could be used as a ledger for everything from inventory management to home ownership validation. 
""More firms are embracing the blockchain than there were in 2018. There's no question about that. Whether or not bitcoin should trade at $10,000 or $20,000 is anybody's guess, but just like gold, it seems like the trend is your friend right now,"" Weiskopf said.

258,By Investing.com,"<span>Sep 05, 2020 06:39AM ET</span>",Point/Counterpoint: Lululemon Versus Gap's Athleta,"By Liz Moyer and Christiana Sciaudone
Investing.com -- Lululemon's been hogging the spotlight, and Gap's been the downward dog for a while now. It's time to turn the tables.
On the surface, it doesn't seem like a fair fight. Lululemon's market cap of $53 billion dwarf's Gap's $6.8 billion. The market clearly thinks its future is the brighter of the two. LULU trades at a forward price to earnings ratio of 81, while GPS trades at a forward price to earnings ratio of 22. But sometimes it pays to be the underdog.
Investing.com's Liz Moyer argues the bull case for  Lululemon Athletica  Inc (NASDAQ:LULU), while Christiana Sciaudone explains why Gap Inc (NYSE:GPS), and its popular Athleta brand, are the ones to beat. This is Point/Counterpoint.
Lululemon is the undisputed specialty brand leader
Comfortable clothing and personal workout equipment for the home are two pandemic trends that bode well for Lululemon's prospects, and Wall Street agrees.
Analysts have been raising their price targets in recent days as Lululemon's earnings release approaches on Tuesday. The consensus estimate tracked by Investing.com is looking for per-share profit of 52 cents on sales of $827 million but some analysts have said they expect an upside surprise. During the same quarter last year, the company had profit of 96 cents a share.
Popular with young women attracted to its $100+ leggings and luxury branding, Lululemon has become the undisputed leader of specialty brands.
Shares are up 54% this year and trading near all-time highs, though they gave back somewhat on Friday amid a broad market rout.
Even  Citigroup  (NYSE:C), which downgraded Lulu last week on valuation concerns, admits Lulu is the mostly highly valued specialty brand ever, with an enterprise value of nearly $50 billion. That's more than twice the previously highest-value brand, Victoria's Secret, in its heyday a few years ago. LULU has a rich price-to-earnings ratio of 81 and a return on equity of 36%.
At around $360, Citi questions whether there is still room to climb, but other analysts see  it differently. Needham analyst Rick Patel raised his price target to $430. ""We believe LUL is one of the best-positioned companies in the current environment,"" he wrote in a note, pointing out the success of other active apparel companies during the second quarter. ""We think that LULU's strong brand and differentiated products position it well to capture demand and gain market share with many consumers at home.""
Stifel also recently raised its price target to $445, which implies a 23% upside from the current price.
Analysts at Piper Sandler checked out traffic at Lulu stores in multiple locations and report long-lines at both full price and outlet locations in Vail, Colorado, Austin, Texas, and Houston.
Lulu's $500 million deal to acquire at-home fitness service The Mirror as a major source of growth and diversification for the company. The acquisition was complete in July and is expected to add $10 million to fiscal second quarter sales, according to BTIG.
It is this digital channel that analysts see as Lulu's biggest source of growth. The Mirror is a streaming workout offering people access from home through a $1,495 wall-mounted machine, similar to the success of exercise class streaming service and stationary bike Peloton (NASDAQ:PTON).
With many people reluctant to return to gyms or other indoor exercise spaces, at-home offerings like Mirror and Peloton have gained popularity. Wedbush writes in a recent note, ""We believe the acquisition of Mirror provides LULU a unique opportunity to further connect with its customers without the limitations of physical locations.""
Since the deal was announced in June, Mirror's streaming downloads have surged to 70,000 from 52,000. The monthly subscription is $39. Piper Sandler (NYSE:PIPR) reckons if Lulu can sign up just 5% of its customer base (7 million people), it could support $700 million of revenue over time.
""We believe it could add $175 million in sales in the next 12 months,"" Piper said in a recent note. ""We see substantial long-term potential to convert LULU customers to buy Mirror over time.""
Gap's Athleta will outshine competitors
Last quarter, Lululemon disappointed, missing estimates when it reported sales of $652 million. That was down 17% from a year earlier. Earnings per share were 22 cents, compared to 74 cents a year earlier. Yes, Covid, etc. But, take a look at Athleta.
Gap beat expectations last quarter, reporting sales of $3.28 billion. That was down 18% compared to a year earlier and couldn't prevent the troubled clothier from losing 17 cents a share, down from earnings per share of 63 cents a year earlier. That said, the clear star of the Gap show is athleisure brand, Athleta, which reported sales growth of 6% for the quarter. And while that represents 8% of revenue for the company, or $262.4 million, there's plenty of opportunity to increase that total. 
The athleisure market is expected to show compound annual growth rate of 6.7% to reach $257.1 billion by 2026, according to a ReportLinker market research report.
Couple the ever-expanding market with the fact that many analysts believe Athleta to be undervalued relative to Lululemon and its appeal as a prime candidate for an acquisition or spinoff -- as Gordon Haskett analyst Dan Bilson wrote in a note last month according to CNBC -- and the underdog isn't looking too shabby.
“Obviously nobody is going to make the case Athleta is worth one-quarter of LULU, or $12.5bn, but given what has happened with LULU of late, it doesn’t require much imagination to come up with a big number for Athleta and just as importantly, one that is rising,” Bilson said. 
Citi valued Athleta at $3.6 billion when it upgraded GPS to buy from neutral last month, also citing the untapped potential of Athleta, The Street reported. 
Karen Finerman of Metropolitan Capital Advisors loves Lululemon, and even she acknowledged there's a problem: LULU has gone parabolic and it trades like the company is working on a vaccine, she said on CNBC
Lululemon's also had some ugly customer service debacles.In 2013, the HuffPost reported that the company exiled larger clothing as part of its strategy to market its brand as the look of choice for the stylishly fitness-conscious. The same year, the Canadian retailer was forced to recall their $98 Luon pants because of complaints the material was too see-through. Founder Chip Wilson, speaking to Bloomberg TV at the time, infamously said: ""Frankly some women's bodies just don't actually work for it."" In other words, if you're not skinny, don't bother. It took Wilson two years to apologize for the gaffe and resign from the board of the company.
Athleta, meanwhile, displays models that are large, small, young, old and of all colors. Women see themselves reflected in the brand. You'd be hard-pressed to find much diversity on the Lululemon website, and that's in keeping with their strategy.
It’s also a bit cheaper to buy Athleta than Lululemon (pants sell for somewhere in the $79 range versus Lululemon’s $97 range), but perhaps more importantly is the return policy. Athleta's is: Give-it-a-workout guarantee. Work it out. If it doesn't perform, return it. By when do you have to return an item? Anytime. Compare that to Lululemon's more restrictive policy: All merchandise must be unwashed and unworn with the original tags attached, and returned within 30 days of delivery.
Topping it off, Athleta offers a credit card with rewards to be spent back in Athleta stores. Lululemon has no such offering. 
So, which will you be wearing?

259,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 05, 2020 05:45AM ET</span>",TikTok troubles narrow gap between Beijing and ByteDance founder Zhang Yiming,"By Yingzhi Yang, Yew Lun Tian and Julie Zhu
BEIJING/HONG KONG (Reuters) - ByteDance founder Zhang Yiming has long positioned himself as a global internet entrepreneur, largely eschewing Chinese government involvement, but U.S. demands to sell his crown jewel TikTok are testing the boundaries with Beijing.
A year ago, ByteDance was approached by the Chinese government with offers of help when TikTok, a short-video app with a huge following among young people globally, faced political heat in India, a source familiar with the situation told Reuters. But the company sent only mid-level staff to meet with government officials, signalling that the company wanted to go it alone. 
The 38-year-old Zhang, who has trodden a different path to other high-profile Chinese tech tycoons, shifted tack in August when President Donald Trump threatened to ban TikTok in the United States unless it was sold to a U.S. firm.
Zhang's team sought a meeting on his behalf with China's ambassador in Washington, Cui Tiankai, two sources familiar with the matter said. 
While Zhang was only hoping for an informal chat with Cui to seek advice, his approach was seen as a turning point, government and industry sources told Reuters. 
The embassy directed the ByteDance team to the foreign ministry in Beijing. Although no further talks took place, and Cui and Zhang did not speak, the Chinese government interpreted the approach as a signal that ByteDance was open to assistance.
China entered the fray on August 28, by revising a tech export control list that experts said would give them regulatory oversight over any TikTok deal. Reuters could not determine if Beijing's interpretation of Zhang's approach and the Chinese government move were linked.
One of the sources said that by standing up for ByteDance, Beijing wanted to demonstrate to private companies caught in the crossfire of China-U.S. strategic competition that the country is firmly behind them.
""We want to show all other countries that this is what the Chinese government will do if you bully any of our companies, so don't follow what the U.S. is doing,"" the source said. 
The diplomatic dance taking place around TikTok follows years of acrimony between Washington and Beijing over the role of China's Huawei Technologies [HWT.UL], which the U.S. has alleged is effectively a Trojan horse for Chinese espionage.
Huawei and Beijing have repeatedly denied any such activity.
Asked about its engagement with ByteDance, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesman said he was not aware of the specifics of the situation, adding that the United States was over-generalising the concept of national security and abusing its power.
""Not only does it go against market principles and international rules, it is a mockery to the principles of market economy and fair competition that the U.S. prides itself on,"" he added.
A senior U.S. administration official said China had blocked U.S. tech companies such as Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Twitter for years and the United States' actions were designed to protect the private information of its citizens.
""We're just very concerned that, essentially, anything that could be done on that platform would be subject to the Chinese Communist Party's algorithmic attempts to control human behavior worldwide."" 
The Chinese embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment. ByteDance declined to comment. 
TikTok has said it would not comply with any request to share user data with the Chinese authorities.
'POLITICAL FOOTBALL'
China had originally considered speeding up the launch of an ""entity list"" to punish foreign companies, groups and individuals deemed harmful to its interests, a government source with direct knowledge of the matter said.
But this was dropped as a countermeasure to the Trump administration's move to ban transactions with ByteDance and Tencent's (HK:0700) WeChat because it would have escalated tensions and was replaced instead by the rules published last week.
Zhang did not know of the tech export rule revisions ahead of time, two sources told Reuters, and the company's view is that it ultimately prefers to be free to make its own decisions, according to one of the sources. Others close to the TikTok sale talks say the move threw a spanner in the works of already-complicated negotiations and could scupper any deal.
China's commerce ministry, which published revisions to the tech export control list, did not respond to a request for comment. 
ByteDance is negotiating with a Microsoft-Walmart (N:WMT) (O:MSFT) coalition, and a competing investor consortium led by software firm Oracle (N:ORCL), on a sale of TikTok that could be worth as much as $30 billion.
ByteDance is still keen not to become a ""political football"" and prefers to use legal means rather than rely on government backing to resolve the issue, the source said. The company is suing to block one of Trump’s orders. 
""I doubt having the government speak up for this company can do much in helping it gain market access into another country,” said Chu Yin, a Chinese scholar with the Center for China and Globalization, a Beijing-based think-tank. 
""ByteDance might fare better if it can share some interests with its competitors in the U.S.,"" he added.
A DIFFERENT PATH 
Zhang has pursued a different path to Chinese internet entrepreneurs such as  Alibaba  (N:BABA) founder Jack Ma, who is a Communist Party member, and Tencent's Pony Ma and Baidu's (O:BIDU) founder and chief executive Robin Li, who are both members of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), a ceremonial advisory body.
Zhang, who is not a member of either, has focussed on global growth even as his counterparts have retrenched from overseas and opted to focus on domestic markets.
This year he appointed new heads for the China operations to personally take up more responsibility over ByteDance's international business and also began moving key research capabilities and decision-making functions abroad. In March, he said in an open letter that he spent two-thirds of 2019 overseas.
He has personally sought advice from around ten people at U.S. think-tanks and former U.S. government officials recently, a source familiar with the situation said.
Zhang has also taken numerous steps to assuage U.S. concerns that TikTok could be endangering Americans by collecting personal data and censoring political content.

He hired former Disney exec Kevin Mayer as TikTok CEO, moved TikTok content moderation work outside China and established a ""transparency center"" in the U.S. to give outsiders access to observe TikTok's data security practices and policies.

261,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 05, 2020 03:45AM ET</span>","Goldman Sachs joins syndicate for Ant IPO of up to $30 billion, say sources","By Julie Zhu, Kane Wu and Scott Murdoch
HONG KONG (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs (N:GS) has joined the growing list of investment banks working on Chinese financial technology firm Ant Group's mammoth initial public offering of up to $30 billion, two people with direct knowledge of the matter said.
Ant, backed by Chinese e-commerce giant  Alibaba  Group (N:BABA) (HK:9988), plans to list simultaneously in Hong Kong and Shanghai, in what sources have said could be the world's largest IPO and come as soon as October.
Wall Street major Goldman Sachs has been hired as a joint lead manager on the Hong Kong leg of the IPO, said the people, who declined to be named as they were not authorised to speak to the media on this subject. 
A spokesman for Goldman Sachs, which also acted as a joint lead manager on Alibaba's $12.9 billion secondary listing in Hong Kong last year, declined to comment. 
Ant also declined to comment.
The IPO of Ant, already the world's most valuable unicorn - or billion-dollar unlisted tech firm - would be the first simultaneous listing in Hong Kong and Shanghai's year-old STAR Market.
The Hong Kong leg of the IPO is being sponsored by China International Capital Corp (CICC) (HK:3908),  Citigroup  (N:C), JPMorgan (N:JPM), and  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS).  Credit Suisse  (S:CSGN) is working as a joint global co-ordinator.
The top-ranked banks in a Hong Kong IPO are known as sponsors and carry legal liability for the accuracy of the prospectus. Under them are joint global coordinators, and on the bottom rung are joint lead managers.
Ant's STAR Market listing is being led by CICC and China Securities Co (HK:6066). 
China's largest brokerage, CITIC Securities (SS:600030) (HK:6030), is set to get a joint underwriter's role on the mainland tranche, four people with knowledge of the matter said on Friday.
Ant's mega IPO size means a large syndicate of investment banks, especially those with strong retail investor networks, is expected to work on the deal as it progresses towards a possible launch in October.
If Ant completes the offering at the around the $30 billion upper end of expectations, it would rival oil giant  Saudi Aramco  (SE:2222), which raised $29.4 billion last December, surpassing the record set by Alibaba's $25 billion float in 2014.

BOSTON (Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Friday ruled two Massachusetts men can be extradited to Japan to face charges that they helped smuggle former Nissan (OTC:NSANY) Motor Co Chairman Carlos Ghosn out of the country while he was awaiting trial on financial crimes.
U.S. Magistrate Judge Donald Cabell in Boston rejected the arguments against extradition by U.S. Army Special Forces veteran Michael Taylor and his son, Peter Taylor, clearing the way for the U.S. State Department to consider turning them over.
Paul Kelly, the Taylors' lawyer, said they would present issues to the State Department that Cabell could not consider, including the ""heroism and courage"" of Michael Taylor and Japan's ""frequent refusal"" to extradite its own citizens.
The State Department did not respond to a request for comment.
Prosecutors say the Taylors facilitated a ""brazen"" escape in which Ghosn fled Japan on Dec. 29, 2019, hidden in a box and on private jet before reaching Lebanon, his childhood home, which has no extradition treaty with Japan.
Ghosn was awaiting trial on charges that he engaged in financial wrongdoing, including by understating his compensation in Nissan's financial statements. Ghosn denies wrongdoing.
Prosecutors said the elder Taylor, a private security specialist, and his son received $1.3 million for their services. They have been held without bail since their arrests in May at Japan's request.
Their lawyers had argued they could not be extradited because Japanese penal code does not make it a crime to help someone ""bail jump,"" and that they could only be charged if Japanese authorities were already pursuing Ghosn pre-escape.

But Cabell declined to second-guess Japan's interpretation of its own law as making it illegal to enable the escape of someone who has committed a crime. He said the Taylors' conduct ""literally brings them squarely within the purview"" of the law.

(Reuters) - Neiman Marcus Group said on Friday it expected to emerge from Chapter 11 bankruptcy by the end of this month under a restructuring plan that is likely to eliminate more than $4 billion of its debt.
The luxury department store chain filed for bankruptcy protection in May, in one of the highest-profile retail collapses during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

The 113-year old company said certain institutional investors will fund a $750 million exit financing package that would fully refinance its debtor-in-possession loan and provide additional liquidity for its business. (https://reut.rs/3lQGqFE)

(Reuters) - Shares of Tesla (O:TSLA) tumbled 7% in extended trade on Friday after the electric car maker was excluded from a group of companies being added to the S&P 500, among them Etsy, whose stock market value is less than a 20th of Tesla's.
The decision by S&P Dow Jones Indices is a blow to Tesla investors who widely expected the company to join the benchmark stock index after a blockbuster quarterly report in July cleared a major hurdle for its potential inclusion.
S&P Dow Jones Indices said in a statement it was adding online craft seller Etsy (O:ETSY), semiconductor equipment maker Teradyne (O:TER) and pharmaceutical technology company Catalent (N:CTLT) to the S&P 500, effective Sept. 21, and removing H&R Block (N:HRB), Coty (N:COTY) and Kohls (N:KSS). 
Shares of Etsy jumped 6% in extended trade, Teradyne rose 2%, and Catalent added 2%.
S&P Dow Jones Indices senior index analyst Howard Silverblatt declined to say why Tesla was not added to the S&P 500, which is tracked by index funds with at least $4.4 trillion in assets. 
""The market is continuously changing, and we need to reflect that in our indices,"" Silverblatt said. 
With a market capitalization over $370 billion, Tesla is one of the most valuable companies on Wall Street. Even after a 16% drop in its share price from record highs this week, Tesla remains more valuable than 95% of the S&P 500's existing components, including Johnson & Johnson (N:JNJ) and Procter & Gamble (N:PG). 
Etsy, Teradyne and Catalent have a combined stock market value of about $40 billion.
Tesla, which is up nearly 400% so far in 2020, is among the most loved - and hated - stocks on Wall Street. It is the U.S. stock market’s highest-profile bet on the rise of renewable energy and the decline of fossil fuels, and Tesla’s Model 3 sedan has made major inroads among consumers.
Its recent stock gains have been driven by Tesla's unexpectedly strong quarterly results released in July, as well as by bets that it would be added to the S&P 500, which would trigger massive demand for its shares from index funds that track the benchmark.
Tesla bears point to looming competition from  Porsche  (DE:PSHG_p), General Motors (N:GM) and other longer-established rivals. They are also skeptical of Tesla’s corporate governance under Chief Executive Elon Musk, who in 2018 agreed to pay $20 million and step down as chairman to settle fraud charges.

Short sellers are betting $24 billion that Tesla’s shares will fall, among the largest short levels on record for a U.S. company, in dollars, according to S3 Partners.

SAO PAULO/NEW DELHI/BENGALURU (Reuters) - Softbank (OTC:SFTBY) Group is taking a direct role in managing its virus-hit hospitality startup Oyo's operations in Latin America through a joint venture which will control all hotels in the region, the head of Oyo Brazil told Reuters in an interview on Friday.
Softbank, the biggest investor in Oyo, will use part of its $5 billion Latin America fund to invest in the newly formed company called Oyo Latam which will take over 1,000 hotels mainly in Brazil and Mexico, Henrique Weaver said. 
Weaver said both companies would have equal representation on the board, but did not say how much Softbank would invest.
The move comes as Oyo, valued at $10 billion in its most recent fundraising round, has been forced to cut costs and rein in its expansionist strategy in global markets by reducing its hotel footprint and laying off employees after revenues took a hit from the coronavirus pandemic. 
It shows the Japanese investor's keenness to ensure the Indian company remains on track, and is the latest sign SoftBank is more closely overseeing Oyo's operations in markets including China, India and Japan, three sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. 
Softbank has taken a big writedowns on bets including shared office space company WeWork and wants to avoid a similar fate with Oyo, in which it has invested over $1 billion, said one of the sources who is directly familiar with Softbank's thinking.
Softbank declined to comment.
An Oyo spokeswoman said Softbank is like any other investor in the company with a seat on the board and that Oyo is ""a management-run and a board-governed company.""
""Any description that Oyo is being managed, or there is any 'additional oversight' (formal or informal) or otherwise is merely media speculation and completely untrue,"" the spokeswoman said. 
SoftBank said it started the partnership with Oyo in Latin America in 2019 and the investment has been recently formalized with the creation of Oyo Latam and the board.
Softbank's Latam fund has invested $75 million into Oyo's business in the region, said a source with knowledge of the matter.
PANDEMIC PAIN
""Latin America has proved to be a good fit for Oyo, with a super fast growth pace because the hotel market is extremely fragmented in the region,"" Weaver said.
The pandemic, however, forced the company to lay off 500 employees in Brazil, leaving it with a workforce of 140 people, Weaver said. It has also given up its office space and slashed operating expenses.
Once among the world's largest hotel chains by room count, Oyo has furloughed hundreds of employees in the United States and Europe and shuttered offices in other global markets. In India and China it began cutting costs and headcount as early as January. 
CHINA CONUNDRUM
Oyo had committed to invest over $600 million in China but in recent months the company has seen an exodus of executives and a shrinking footprint while also battling lawsuits filed by hotel partners and vendors over non-payment of dues.
The lawsuits have resulted in some of Oyo's bank accounts in China being frozen but the company said that is a standard process and does not mean it is guilty.
""We are vigorously defending these allegations in court of law including disputes on the dues and claims,"" the Oyo spokeswoman said.
Oyo is down to 1,200 employees in China, compared with a peak of over 6,000. 
Oyo's retreat from China may prove costly in future, as investors drove up the company's valuation to $10 billion largely due to the potential and size of its bet on the country.

""In China, we have hit the reset button and are making sure we have a kernel of profitable business before we rapidly expand,"" the spokeswoman said.

269,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 04, 2020 10:57PM ET</span>",U.S. Justice Department's Google lawsuit expected in weeks ahead: sources,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Justice Department, which has been conducting an antitrust investigation of Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google, plans to bring a lawsuit against Google as soon as this month, according to two sources familiar with the probe, who said the focus remains on search and advertising.
Deputy Attorney General Jeff Rosen told Reuters last month that the Justice Department was moving ""full tilt"" on a probe of Google and other Big Tech platforms. 
A complaint, which had been expected around Labor Day, is now expected this month but potentially as late as mid-October, and is likely to focus on two sets of allegations, the sources said.
A person briefed on the matter confirmed that some career Justice Department attorneys have pushed to delay filing of a case pending further work, while Attorney General William Barr has pressed to move faster.
Barr told the Wall Street Journal last month that he was ""hoping to make a decision by the end of the summer"" on the Google probe. 
The department is focusing on allegations that Google violates antitrust law by favoring its own businesses, for example YouTube, in search results rather than presenting neutral search results, the sources said. 
A Federal Trade Commission (FTC) probe of Google that included this allegation and wrapped up in 2013 found no justification to take action on it. 
Since then, the European Union has fined Google $2.6 billion for favoring its own price-comparison shopping service over smaller European rivals.
Executives knowledgeable about the advertising industry have alleged that Google abuses its dominance in display search advertising by requiring companies that want to use Google's popular ad exchange to also use Google Ad Manager to serve their ads. This has pushed several ad tech companies to switch to other businesses.
""While we continue to engage with ongoing investigations, our focus is firmly on providing free services that help people every day, lower costs for small businesses, and enable increased choice and competition,"" Google spokesperson Jose Castaneda said.
The Justice Department had no immediate comment.
A lawsuit would be the next big step in an investigation that the Justice Department said in July 2019 it opened to determine whether major technology firms engage in anticompetitive practices. The FTC is probing  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN).
Parallel to the Justice Department, a large group of state attorneys general are probing Google and holding regular meetings with federal law enforcers. At least 12 of these will likely sign on to the Justice Department lawsuit, and perhaps many more, one of the sources said.

There is some concern among Democratic state attorneys general that the federal government will move too fast and file a lawsuit that needs more work, the second source said. A third source agreed.

(Reuters) - Warren Buffett's  Berkshire Hathaway Inc  (N:BRKa) said on Friday it has sold shares of some of the largest U.S. banks, slashing its stakes in  Wells Fargo  & Co (N:WFC) and JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) and exiting an investment in  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS).
In a regulatory filing detailing its U.S.-listed investments as of June 30, Berkshire also disclosed a new 20.9 million share investment worth $563.6 million in Toronto-based  Barrick Gold Corp  (TO:ABX), one of the world's largest mining companies.
Investors monitor Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire's quarterly filings to see where Buffett and his portfolio managers Todd Combs and Ted Weschler see value.
Shares of Barrick have benefited from rising gold prices, which set a record last week, and rose 3.2% in after-hours trading following Berkshire's disclosure. Barrick did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Berkshire reduced its Wells Fargo stake by 26% in the quarter to 237.6 million shares.
Since early 2018, Berkshire has shed more than half of its Wells Fargo shares, which were once worth $32 billion but lost value as the bank was hurt by scandals for mistreating customers. Buffett first invested in Wells Fargo in 1989.
Berkshire also reduced by 62% its stake in JPMorgan, where Combs is a director, to 22.2 million shares, and shed its remaining 1.9 million Goldman shares.
Buffett has not given up on the banking industry, after telling investors in May that banks were well-capitalized and capable of weathering the coronavirus pandemic. 
Berkshire still invests in several banks including Bank of America Corp (N:BAC), where in the last month it invested more than $2 billion, giving it an 11.9% stake worth more than $27 billion.
In Friday's filing, Berkshire said it also exited its investment in Toronto-based Restaurant Brands International Inc (TO:QSR), the parent of Burger King and Tim Hortons.

Berkshire also has more than 90 operating units including the Geico car insurer, BNSF railroad and Dairy Queen ice cream.

LONDON (Reuters) - Brexit safeguards to stop asset managers in Britain running ""shell"" investment funds in the European Union to retain access to its markets should be hardwired into EU law, the bloc's securities watchdog said on Wednesday.
After Britain voted in 2016 to leave the EU, the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) issued guidance on minimum ""substance"" or senior boots on the ground at EU funds typically domiciled in Dublin and Luxembourg and whose portfolio management has been ""delegated"" to London.
""Moreover, in light of the withdrawal of the UK from the EU, delegation of portfolio management functions to non-EU entities is likely going to further increase,"" ESMA said in a letter to the bloc's financial services chief Valdis Dombrovskis.
ESMA said there was merit in providing ""clearer legal drafting"" in the bloc's laws on substance and delegation requirements in line with its earlier Brexit guidance.
The EU may want to back up the ""qualitative"" criteria on substance with clear quantitative criteria, or provide a list of core or critical functions that may not be delegated at alternative and mutual funds, ESMA said.
""Put simply, this is an attack on London,"" said Jake Green, a financial regulatory partner at Ashurst law firm.
""It is also doubtful that Luxembourg and Ireland will be happy with this as it could materially impact their fund offerings,"" Green said.
A pending review of EU alternative fund rules that cover hedge funds and private equity funds was an opportunity to consider ""greater harmonisation"" with regulations governing mutual funds known as UCITS, ESMA said.
Alternative funds must report exposures to real estate and corporate debt to enable authorities to assess if they have enough liquidity in a market crisis.
ESMA said it was ""sub optimal"" that it does not have access to similar data on UCITS without extensive ad hoc data requests that slow down analysis.
ESMA is already checking on liquidity at UCITS.
""This assessment should be based on the analysis of how funds have reacted since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and their current situation, and on an estimation of their resilience to a future shock,"" ESMA said.

272,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 04, 2020 10:55PM ET</span>","Global funds once again opt out of stocks, despite rally, Reuters polls show","By Rahul Karunakar and Tushar Goenka
BENGALURU (Reuters) - Funds recommended equity holdings be trimmed to the lowest in over four years in August, despite record-breaking gains by world stocks, as the pandemic drags on and new data suggest the nascent economic rebound is stalling, Reuters polls found.
The August 17-27 poll of 35 fund managers and chief investment officers in the U.S., Europe, Britain and Japan was largely taken before Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell announced a new policy framework promoting higher inflation to spur economic recovery and job creation on Thursday.
The Fed's new strategy sent U.S. Treasury yields higher, which gave a lift to interest rate-sensitive financials and in turn boosted the S&P 500 index to a new record high and pushed the MSCI's all-country world index to surge past its pre-COVID-19 high reached in February.
While world stocks have risen as much as nearly 60% since March troughs, the poll showed average recommended exposure for equities in August in the model global portfolio was the lowest since July 2016, down to 43.1% from 43.9% the previous month.
Overall equity exposure is down 6.6 percentage points from the beginning of the year, down from 49.7% in January.
""The recent upsurge in stock markets around the world is all noise for us as a health solution is still out of reach. We are more concerned about the recovery story. The risks to the global economy remain, with tens of millions of people still out of work because of the pandemic,"" said a global chief investment officer at a large U.S. fund management company.
""The stock market in the near term may be juiced further on the Fed news. But we doubt whether the Fed would be able to lift inflation despite the new target as it hasn't been able to do so since 2012. Let's not forget, the U.S. economy is still in a deep crisis, and the risks are more to the downside as Americans prepare to vote in a contentious Nov. 3 election.""
Economic recovery was foremost in Powell's remarks made as part of the Kansas City Fed's virtual Jackson Hole symposium, in which he outlined an aggressive new strategy that aims to boost employment and allow inflation to run a bit faster for longer than in the past.
That came as new data suggest the labour market recovery is stalling, while the U.S. economy suffered its sharpest contraction in the second quarter since the government started keeping records in 1947.
The poll suggested keeping bond allocations - a key gauge of caution - for a model global portfolio at 44.3%, the highest since the survey series started in early 2010, for the third month in a row.
That defensive outlook of long-term investors does not align with the approach of over 200 equity strategists in a separate Reuters poll this week, who expect stocks to keep rising. But they did say a sombre economic outlook was likely to push stock markets to close the year below their pre-pandemic highs. [EPOLL/WRAP]
In the latest poll, fund managers with a view on when the current bull run in stocks will end were split. About 43% of respondents, or nine of 21, said it already had. Seven, or 33%, said it has over two years to run.
""This recent bull market rally has been narrow in respect to sector rotation with the economically-sensitive stocks having lagged whilst uncertainties over the second wave of COVID-19 haunts part of the market,"" said Peter Lowman, chief investment officer at Investment Quorum in London. 
""Nonetheless, central bank policy remains supportive and therefore the equity markets are likely to continue their upward trajectory but with some corrective periods along the way.""
But responses to a separate question suggested fund managers were still cautious in their approach.
Asked what is the most likely change to their portfolios, over 85% of the fund managers, or 18 of 21, said they would ""roughly maintain the current risk positioning"". Those views were broadly unchanged from the July survey.
""This crisis is already telling us that it will not be a neat and tidy economic global downturn followed by an equal and opposite neat and tidy upturn, like one might see in a traditional economic cycle,"" said Mark Robinson, chief investment officer at Bordier & Cie (UK).

""There are clearly still many uncertainties related to the virus itself and uncertainty about the scale and shape of the recovery, so some caution is still rightly warranted.""

Berkshire said in a regulatory filing https:// it owned about 137.6 million shares, worth $3.4 billion, of the fourth-largest U.S. bank by assets, down about 100 million from the end of June.
Buffett began investing in Wells Fargo in 1989, but has been reducing Berkshire's stake as the bank struggles to recover from a series of scandals over its treatment of customers, including the opening of accounts without their knowledge.
Wells Fargo's ability to grow remains subject to a Federal Reserve limit. Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Investors Service on Wednesday lowered its rating outlook on the bank to ""negative"" from ""stable"", citing the bank's slower-than-expected ability to resolve governance and oversight issues from previous years.

274,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 04, 2020 10:55PM ET</span>","Why Buffett's bet on Japan could turn on higher inflation, weakening dollar","By David Randall and Svea Herbst-Bayliss
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) Inc's $6.2 billion foray into Japan's five largest trading houses may signal billionaire Warren Buffett's expectation that inflation and a falling U.S. dollar may make international equities more attractive when economies worldwide recover from the coronavirus pandemic. 
Berkshire said late Sunday, on Buffett's 90th birthday, it owned just over 5% of each of Itochu Corp, Marubeni Corp, Mitsubishi Corp, Mitsui & Co Ltd and Sumitomo Corp, and said it could increase its stakes to 9.9%.
The trading houses, known as sogo shosha with their diversified business lines including commodity exploration, fit the legendary investor's taste for classic value stocks, which have lost investor favor. 
Berkshire investors said they welcomed Buffett's wager, at a time U.S. stock valuations are at their highest since the late 1990s tech bubble, lifted by giants such as Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), both of which Berkshire invests in. 
""The inflation cocktail is being mixed and Buffett is migrating his investment to where you can create value through inflation,"" said Bill Smead, chief investment officer at Smead Capital Management, which invests nearly 3% of its assets in Berkshire. ""These are companies that will make more money if the price of oil (or) any input goes up."" 
Prices of gold, inflation-linked bonds and some commodities have surged since March on fears that global central banks' more than $9 trillion of stimulus to combat the pandemic will spark higher inflation. 
The Federal Reserve indicated last week it will be slower to move to curtail inflation should it run above its 2% target. 
At the same time, lower valuations and a continued decline in the U.S. dollar, now near a two-year low, could make Japan and other international markets more attractive for U.S. investors, said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at the Leuthold Group. Expectations of dollar weakness bolster the case for U.S. investors to own international equities if profits get a boost from the strength of the currencies they are denominated in.""That adds up to a pretty good situation for investing in these companies,"" Paulson said of Berkshire's choices.The move fits with Buffett's longstanding preference for value stocks. 
“Warren is trying to expand his horizon but stick to his value investing roots at a time the U.S. market is very expensive,"" said Paul Lountzis, president of Lountzis Asset Management, which invests nearly one-fifth of its assets in Berkshire.
Jamie Rosenwald, co-founder and senior portfolio manager of Asia and Japan investments at Dalton Investments, said Buffett got a bargain ""at laughably low valuations on the stock market"" which show the ""tremendous values available in Japan today.""
Buffett, who at Berkshire's annual meeting in May professed optimism in the U.S. ability to persevere through the pandemic, has looked outside the country before, having bought such companies as Israel's IMC International Metalworking and German motorcycle apparel retailer Detlev Louis. “Buffett certainly loves the United States,"" said James Armstrong, president of Henry H. Armstrong Associates, which invests one-fourth its assets in Berkshire. ""Considering that he was able to tap into companies with a global network and their fingers in a lot of pies at an attractive price, that is a winning combination."" 
The bet on the Japanese companies may strengthen Berkshire's toehold in the Chinese market, said Guy Spier, portfolio manager at Aquamarine Capital in Zurich, who said that those businesses ""have spent far more time figuring out how to deal with a rising China than many."" 
Charlie Munger, Berkshire's 96-year-old vice chairman, said in February that Chinese companies are stronger and growing faster than their American counterparts. Berkshire has an investment in BYD Co (OTC:BYDDF), a Chinese electric car maker.The deal will also help Berkshire trim its $145 billion cash pile. 
“Berkshire has the high class problem of needing to put billions of dollars to work,” said Dalton's Rosenwald.

LONDON (Reuters) - Star banker Erik Maris is in the process of leaving investment banking boutique Messier Maris & Associés after a power struggle with partner Jean-Marie Messier, two sources with knowledge of the matter told Reuters.
The 56-year Frenchman has decided to quit the firm which he co-founded in 2010 with Messier, a former chairman and CEO of Vivendi (OTC:VIVHY), the sources said, speaking on condition of anonymity as the matter is confidential.
Maris did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
His departure comes after Italian bank  Mediobanca  (MI:MDBI) bought a 66% stake in Messier Maris & Associés in 2019 to boost its presence overseas.
Maris has yet to hand in his resignation to Mediobanca and formalise his decision, they said.
Mediobanca declined to comment.
The sources said Maris intends to move on after disagreements with Messier over strategy and management, as he no longer sees a future for himself at the firm.
The pair built Messier Maris & Associés into France's most successful M&A boutique, advising on more than 200 transactions including Veolia's (PA:VIE) recent takeover bid for French utility Suez (PA:SEVI). 
A former Lazard (NYSE:LAZ) banker, Maris is a popular rainmaker in France where he recently represented carmaker  Peugeot  (PA:PEUP) on its merger with  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles (MI:FCHA).
He started his career at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) and spent almost two decades at Lazard where he rose to become co-head of the bank's French franchise.

279,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 04, 2020 04:30PM ET</span>",SoftBank option purchases raise eyebrows as Wall Street backtracks,"By Greg Roumeliotis, Alden Bentley and Anirban Sen
(Reuters) - SoftBank Group Corp (T:9984) made significant option purchases during the run-up in the U.S. stock market in recent weeks as a way of temporarily investing some proceeds from asset sales, people familiar with the matter said on Friday.
The trades were revealed just as Wall Street's runaway technology-led rally was faltering. The derivatives purchases could shed light on the Nasdaq (IXIC) and S&P 500 (SPX) rise just two days ago to record highs, which seemed to put the coronavirus sell-off in the rearview mirror. 
In August, SoftBank Chief Executive Masayoshi Son had announced a new investment management subsidiary that would park excess cash from a massive asset sale program in liquid stocks.
In total, SoftBank injected roughly $4 billion building up stakes in Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN), Netflix Inc (O:NFLX), Tesla Inc (O:TSLA),  Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT) and Alphabet Inc (O:GOOGL), according to regulatory filings.
SoftBank bought a roughly equal amount of call options tied to the shares it bought, according to the Wall Street Journal. Investors typically pay premiums to buy call options, which give them access to a much higher amount of shares on paper. 
SoftBank's options of $4 billion generated an exposure of about $50 billion, according to the WSJ report. 
So far, SoftBank has spent roughly $10 billion buying shares. It has also spent more buying derivatives in U.S. stocks, the sources told Reuters. The Financial Times first reported on these derivative purchases on Friday.
But market players were unable to gauge the extent to which Softbank (OTC:SFTBY)'s derivative purchases contributed to recent gains. Nor was there strong evidence that the end of the buying could have triggered the stocks tumble on Thursday and Friday. 
Raymond James market strategist Ellis Phifer said the buying by SoftBank would have helped push up shares of tech companies in recent months, although the stocks were benefiting from other trends. The extra demand from SoftBank “would have created a positive feedback loop,” he said.

SOFTBANK'S TECH BET
SoftBank has received $42 billion in cash from a string of recent asset divestments, including the sale of stakes in its Japanese telecommunications unit, wireless carrier T-Mobile US (NASDAQ:TMUS) and Chinese e-commerce giant  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group. 
The latest bet on publicly listed tech stocks represent a departure for SoftBank. 
It has been under pressure from hedge fund Elliott Management to use this cash to pay down debt and buy back shares, after its attempt to raise a second $100 billion Vision Fund struggled because of the lukewarm investment performance of its predecessor and faltering bets . 
SoftBank has been temporarily investing some of the proceeds from the asset sales in the U.S. stock market before returning it to shareholders and paying down debt. 
A SoftBank spokeswoman declined to comment. 
Reuters could not immediately determine what options strategy, or combination of put options and call options, SoftBank used. Hedging around the purchase and sale of options can magnify moves in the underlying market. 
Call options gain in value when prices rise, while puts rise when prices fall. 
Buying options can be a cheaper way of investing in an underlying security than direct purchases. But selling uncovered options can be extremely risky. Options prices are determined by factors such as how far away the strike price is, the time to maturity and how volatile the markets are. 
The main indexes on Friday were recoiling from the all-time highs hit midweek. The Nasdaq was on track for its biggest two-day fall since March as investors dumped heavyweight technology stocks, while concerns around a patchy economic recovery also hit the S&P 500 and the blue-chip Dow.

""If SoftBank was selling puts its a very dangerous strategy. The big questions are - the scale of what they were doing and are they selling puts to buy calls - because that's when you get embedded leverage,” said Michael Purves, founder and CEO of Tallbacken Capital.

280,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 04, 2020 04:10PM ET</span>",Argentina's old bonds wave goodbye as focus turns to new debt,"By Walter Bianchi and Marc Jones
BUENOS AIRES/LONDON (Reuters) - Out with the old. In with the new.
Argentina's old sovereign bonds took their final bow on Friday after a near $65 billion restructuring, with new instruments set to be issued and start trading in earnest next week, drawing a line under the country's ninth default.
The bonds, including the notorious ""century bond"" maturing in 2117, came into the spotlight as Argentina buckled under economic crisis, leaving it unable to keep up with repayments and leading to a default in May.
After months of tense negotiations, the country's center-left Peronist government reached a breakthrough accord with creditors at the start of August, which led to 99% of the eligible debt being restructured.
On Friday, Argentina also achieved close to 99% acceptance in an early restructuring of around $41.7 billion in local law bonds denominated in foreign currency, a Reuters calculation from a local securities regulator statement showed. 
The country will issue 12 new international bonds that mature between 2029 and 2046, and should start trading from Monday, a holiday in the United States, meaning they would gain volume on Tuesday, traders said.
""Today when the new bonds are settled, the previous ones will disappear,"" said Roberto Geretto, an economist at Banco CMF in Buenos Aires.
In gray market transactions, the new bonds were trading at around an 11% yield, analysts and traders said, giving some indication of where they could settle next week.
""The first operations of the new titles showed optimistic results, with yields close to 11% in the bonds of both legislations,"" Argentine brokerage Portfolio Personal Inversiones (PPI) said in a note. ""In any case, to get a true idea of these yields we will have to wait for more deals that will be given with the liquidations on the different exchanges.""
Viktor Szabo at Aberdeen Standard Investments in London said the new 2030 bonds had started trading on Thursday at 55 cents, or at around a 9.6% yield, though had closed lower at 51.5-52.2 cents, indicating a 10.6% yield.
Brokerage SBS said that in thin trading, foreign law dollar bonds traded at yields of around 10%-11%.
Another important step will be when the new bonds are added into JP Morgan's widely tracked emerging market debt indexes, set for Thursday, which is expected to increase the country's weighting in dollar-denominated indexes.
Argentina's final proposal gave creditors an average net present value of 54.8 cents on the dollar. The country's bonds have been on a wild ride since mid-2019, tumbling as low as 20-odd cents on the dollar before rising in recent months.
The government will now turn its attention to talks with the International Monetary Fund to negotiate a deal to replace its record $57-billion standby agreement struck in 2018.
A number of regional governments are also involved in smaller restructurings, including Buenos Aires Province, which is in talks to revamp around $7.148 billion in debt.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 ended its five-week win streak on Friday, even as an Apple-led rebound helped the broader market off session lows and overshadowed concerns about the pace of the economic recovery amid a mixed jobs report.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.56%, or 159 points. The S&P 500 was down 0.82%, while the Nasdaq Composite slipped 1.27%. Both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq ended their five-week win streak.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) closed positive after falling more than 5% intraday. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) also ended off session lows helping the broader market find its footing.
Microsoft was given added boost after the Pentagon reportedly reaffirmed that the tech giant's proposal for the Jedi cloud contract represents best value, marking a blow to Amazon's legal challenge to appeal the original decision.     
The Apple-led rebound comes in the wake of mixed jobs report that flagged concerns about the pace of the recovery. 
Nonfarm payrolls grew by 1.37 million last month, just below expectations of a 1.4 million, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Friday. But the unemployment rate fell to 8.4% from 10.2%, a sharper contraction than the 9.8% expected.
While the headline number was under consensus, a deeper dive into the report flagged concerns about the labor market as the gains were led by the hiring of government employees, while the private sector remains sluggish.
Private employers rehired just 1 million workers, and have recovered less than half the jobs lost in March and April.
Stifel Economics, however, suggested the report pointed to improving momentum in the labor market, which could ""could alleviate pressure on the White House and Democratic leaders to restart stimulus negotiations, which have reportedly been stalled over the size and scope of the potential package.""
Ahead of the Federal Reserve's meeting later this month, Powell described the jobs report as a ""good,"" and said the ""the economy's going to need low interest rates, which support economic activity, for an extended period of time,"" according to NPR.
A rise in financials also supported the recovery, with JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM),  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) trading in the green.  
Philadelphia Semiconductor Index fell 1%, but losses were stifled by a 3% rise in Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO).
Broadcom reported better-than-expected quarterly earnings late Thursday, and guidance topped estimates on expectations for a ramp-up in wireless. 
Elsewhere on the earnings front, DocuSign (NASDAQ:DOCU) slumped 11% despite reporting second-quarter earnings more than double consensus.  
 Smith & Wesson  Brands (NASDAQ:SWBI) also reported earnings and revenue that markedly topped analysts’ estimates but saw its shares slip more than 4%.
In merger news, Just Eat Takeaway said it had received all necessary regulatory approvals for its $7.3 billion merger with Grubhub, and expects the deal to be completed in the first half of 2021.  Grubhub Inc  (NYSE:GRUB) was down about 0.8%."
282,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 04, 2020 03:36PM ET</span>",Pickup in U.S. Employment Complicates Talks on Fiscal Stimulus,"(Bloomberg) -- The latest U.S. employment gains dispelled pessimism that the jobs rebound is deflating, but also risks delaying a new round of federal aid that’s been a lifeline for millions of Americans and small businesses during the pandemic.
August’s increase in Americans entering the labor market helped drive the unemployment rate down almost two percentage points to 8.4%, better than all economist estimates though still well above the pre-crisis level. Employers added 1.37 million people to payrolls, about one-sixth of whom were temporary workers for the decennial census.
Republicans, who put forth a smaller stimulus proposal than Democrats, took the report as a sign that the $600 supplemental weekly jobless payments that ended in late July had discouraged people from seeking jobs. While that may be true for some people, economists said the latest gains largely reflected continued reopenings. Further improvement is likely to be slower, with beleaguered states preparing job cuts, large firms announcing layoffs and online schooling taking a toll on parents.
The positive report “removes any kind of urgency for bills to get done over the next couple weeks,” said Justin Weidner, an economist at Deutsche Bank AG (NYSE:DB).
While the expiration of the supplemental payments may have helped with hiring, the bigger reason driving the improvement “was kind of a continuation of the stories we’ve been seeing as the economy reopened and the labor market has improved,” Weidner said.
The August payroll data support that: Of the major private-sector industries, retail added the most jobs, about 249,000 -- particularly in general merchandise and motor vehicles. Restaurants and bars, along with temporary help services, also accounted for a significant part of hiring.

President Donald Trump tweeted “Great Jobs Numbers!” after the report, while White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow underscored Republicans’ demand for a smaller stimulus.
“Why don’t we pass a more modest package instead of something that goes into multitrillion dollars that we do not need and would be counterproductive in the long term?” Kudlow said on Bloomberg Television Friday.
Meanwhile, Democrats repeated their call for a more than $2 trillion plan, highlighting the more than 10 million Americans who remain unemployed, as well as the rising numbers of permanent job losers and long-term jobless.
Biden said in a speech Friday that only wealthy people are feeling the recovery while others are still suffering. “The report reinforced the worst fears and painful truths,” Biden said.
Relying on this jobs report to delay stimulus is a mistake, according to ING chief international economist James Knightley.
“The hit to incomes from the cut in unemployment payments and the absence of a broader fiscal support package means there are major challenges for the economy as it tries to recoup all its lost output,” he said in a note. There could be a monthly payrolls contraction in coming months, “underlining the case for additional fiscal stimulus and the need for good news on a Covid vaccine.”
What Bloomberg’s Economists Say
“The expiration of the $600 top-up to unemployment benefits appears to have encouraged a number of Americans to seek employment. ... Yet the labor-market recovery is slowing well shy of the pre-pandemic peak, and well-targeted fiscal aid is still needed to sustain momentum in spending through year-end, and into 2021.”
-- Yelena Shulyatyeva, Andrew Husby and Eliza Winger
Read more for the full reaction note.
Several studies have thrown cold water on the idea that the $600 payments discouraged people from returning to work. Their expiration probably didn’t play a major role in August’s jobs gain, according to Heidi Shierholz, senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute and a Labor Department chief economist under President Barack Obama.
“A job is so precious,” she said. “The idea that you would turn down a job for temporary benefits, it just doesn’t make sense in the vast majority of people’s lives.”
With the $600 payments expired and congressional negotiations at a stalemate, Trump in early August announced an additional $300 a week in federal jobless benefits for most unemployment insurance recipients. While the majority of states have been approved for the funds, only some states have actually begun paying out the added benefits.
“It is good that we are seeing job growth, we are improving, this labor market is getting stronger,” Shierholz said. “The really bad news is it’s still in absolute crisis.”

(Reuters) -  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS) and  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS) on Friday revised lower two key measures of the banks' ability to deploy cash in an emergency, after the Federal Reserve said it made an error in its June stress test results. 
The Fed said Friday that it miscalculated hypothetical trading losses for Goldman and four other banks and issued corrected stress test results. In response, Goldman issued a statement saying it revised its stress capital buffer downward to 6.6% from 6.7%, and lowered the corresponding standard common equity tier 1 (CET1) ratio requirement to 13.6% from 13.7%.
Morgan Stanley meanwhile lowered its stress capital buffer to 5.7% from 5.9% and its CET1 ratio to 13.2% from 13.4%. 
In June, the Fed examined big banks' balance sheets to see if they had enough funds on hand to handle losses during two years of severe economic and market stress. 
Goldman's loan portfolio suffered significantly higher hypothetical loss rates than those of peers. The Fed ordered Goldman to hold the most capital of the 34 banks it tested, requiring it to have a CET1 ratio of 13.7% by Oct. 1. 

Goldman said in June that it had already boosted capital measures and was on track to meet the Federal Reserve's benchmark for October. Now that will be slightly easier to achieve.

TORONTO (Reuters) - Canada's main stock market index fell on Friday by the most in nearly three months as a selloff in high-flying technology shares continued, while the Canadian dollar strengthened as domestic jobs data added to evidence of economic recovery.
The Toronto Stock Exchange's S&P/TSX composite index (GSPTSE) fell 1.8% to 16,151.28, its largest decline since June 11. It was the second straight day of sharp declines for the TSX and other North American indices, which had been on a tear since March.

Canada added 245,800 jobs in August, the fourth consecutive monthly increase though the pace of new gains slowed, bringing employment within about a million jobs of pre-pandemic levels, Statistics Canada said.

PARIS (Reuters) - Since its start as a grocery pushcart, the Fauchon delicatessen has been on the same spot in central Paris for 134 years where it was buffeted by two World Wars, countless mass demonstrations, strikes and riots. 
Now Fauchon, famous for its eclairs, foie gras, truffles, and fine wines, is grappling with the coronavirus pandemic which has robbed Paris of most of its tourism trade and struck when the store's footfall was already weakened by months of social unrest.
In June, Fauchon put its two flagship stores on Place de la Madeleine into receivership and submitted a restructuring plan to court, which will rule by Sept. 15. 
""All demonstrations in Paris seem to start or finish at La Madeleine, and each time we need to close shop. Then there were the strikes around Christmas, our peak period, then came Covid, which was the final blow,"" Fauchon executive Justine Klar said.
The firm has warned its 107 staff at La Madeleine there will be job cuts and is negotiating redundancy terms with unions. 
Fauchon hopes to move to cheaper premises in Paris, away from the demonstrations circuit and to focus more on a Parisian clientele than on tourists. It also wants to boost its network of 73 franchises in Europe, Asia and the Middle East, which are not impacted by the receivership.
Founded in 1886 by a pushcart fruit and vegetable grocer named Auguste Fauchon, the store is one of several Paris luxury food brands with 19th century roots. Like macaron shop Laduree, hot chocolate specialist Angelina and gourmet traiteur Maxim's, Fauchon competes with LVMH-owned market leader La Grande Epicerie. 
Fauchon said that even if its food outlets will likely move, its luxury hotel is doing well and will stay at La Madeleine.
""La Madeleine was the cradle for Fauchon, so it is very important for us to maintain a presence here,"" she said.

The Black unemployment rate in August was 13%, down from 14.6% in July. This put the unemployment rate at about 1.8 times that of White Americans, which dropped to 7.3% last month, according to a Bureau of Labor Statistics report released Friday. The unemployment rate for White Americans was below the overall rate, which fell to 8.4% in August from 10.2%.
The gap between the female and male jobless rate narrowed to 0.3 percentage point as the female unemployment rate declined to 8.6% from 10.6% the prior month. The male rate fell to 8.3%. Before the pandemic, fewer women were unemployed than men.
The large drop in the female jobless coincided with an increase in the participation rate for women of a tenth of a percentage point, to 56.1%. The rate for men rose to 67.7% from 67.1%.
The biggest decrease in unemployment was seen by Latino Americans. The Latino jobless rate, which was the highest among the biggest race groups during the pandemic, fell by 2.4 percentage points to 10.5%. The drop was even greater for Latina women ages 20 and over, with a decline of 3.5 percentage points to 10.5%.
The Asian unemployment rate, which before the pandemic was the lowest among the race groups, fell to 10.7% from 12% the previous month.
The employment-to-population ratio rose to 56.5%. It was 61.1% before the pandemic. This measure offers a broad picture of the country’s employment conditions because it counts the entire population, including those who may be retired and children who are too young to work. The ratio for women, at 51.3%, is up from 45.8% in April at the height of the coronavirus lockdowns.

""If they need additional assistance, we stand ready to work with them to hammer out additional packages,"" Kudlow said in an interview with Bloomberg TV.
Airlines for America, the main lobby for U.S. airlines, does not expect air travel to return to pre-pandemic levels until 2024 and is hoping for a second round of government aid to help the industry, Chief Executive Nicholas Calio said on Thursday.
U.S. passenger airlines are still collectively losing more than $5 billion a month as 30% of planes remain parked. Passenger travel demand is down about 70% and, on average, planes that are flying are half-full.
Last week, American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) said its workforce would shrink by 40,000, including 19,000 involuntary cuts, in October unless the government extends aid for airline employee payrolls.

United said on Thursday it will need to cut 2,850 pilot jobs between Oct. 1 and Nov. 30 if the government does not extend assistance.

The loss-making carrier has been ordered by the country's top court to pay roughly 500 billion Indian rupees ($6.81 billion) in dues to the government over a ten-year period and it has so far paid 78.54 billion rupees.
Vodafone said it would raise up to 150 billion rupees through debentures and an equal amount by issuing shares and warrants, but together will not exceed 250 billion rupees.
The plan to raise fresh capital also comes as the third largest telecom operator in India grapples with an erosion in subscriber base due to a price war triggered by  Reliance Industries ' (NS:RELI) telecoms venture Jio Infocomm.
Vodafone lost 4.7 million subscribers in May alone, data from the country's telecom regulator showed, while its gross debt stood at 1.19 trillion Indian rupees as of June end.
The joint venture between Britain's Vodafone Plc (L:VOD) and India's  Idea Cellular  had last month reported its eight straight quarterly loss and unveiled a plan to reduce costs by 40 billion rupees a year over 18 months.

296,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 04, 2020 10:30AM ET</span>",Column: U.S. equity markets surge in reprise of the 1990s - Kemp,"By John Kemp
LONDON (Reuters) - U.S. equity prices are increasingly deviating from their multi-decade trend, implying there has been a fundamental shift in valuation, or the market has become overheated and risks a sharp downward correction.
Since the 1920s, the broad-market Standard and Poor’s 500 equity index (S&P 500) and its predecessors have increased at a compound average rate of 6.8% per year, reflecting the growth in economic output and the impact of inflation.
The index has exhibited large and sustained deviations from trend, sometimes lasting years or decades, but has proved consistently trend-reverting, implying valuations are anchored in fundamentals over the long term.
But in the 12 months to the end of August, the index rose by nearly 20%, one of the fastest increases in the last decade, and a significant turnaround from the market slump in February and March.
By the end of August, the index was 34% above its long-term trend, the largest positive deviation since October 2007, shortly before the subprime housing bubble burst and the business expansion ended.
The index’s positive deviation was in the 90th percentile for all months since 1930, indicating it was richly valued, with an above average risk of correcting lower in future.
The only period when the index exhibited a larger and sustained positive deviation was between late 1996 and early 2002, the era of “irrational exuberance” culminating in the dotcom bubble and its aftermath.
MONETARY EASING
The duration and magnitude of the deviation from trend during the late 1990s and early 2000s should serve as a warning that mean reversion does not always happen quickly.
In the late 1990s, equity valuations were boosted by sharp reductions in interest rates as the Federal Reserve sought to keep the business expansion going and address liquidity risks within the financial system. 
The Fed responded to the Asian financial crisis, Russian debt default, failure of Long-Term Capital Management, Year 2000 computer problem and bursting of the dotcom bubble itself by cutting rates and pumping liquidity into the financial system, prolonging the positive deviation in equity markets.
Nonetheless, the record-breaking positive deviation ended in a reversion to trend by the end of 2002 and early 2003 (https://tmsnrt.rs/2QTUzUd).
The current large positive deviation poses the question whether something fundamental has changed, or whether equities have become increasingly overvalued and a reversion closer to trend is increasingly likely in future (though the timing would still remain uncertain).
On the fundamental side, the Fed’s easing of monetary policy and its adoption of a new policy framework committing the central bank to a more relaxed policy in future could both support higher equity prices.
The reduction of returns on risk-free assets such as U.S. Treasury securities is pushing investors into riskier assets such as equities while reducing the discount rate on future corporate income streams and boosting valuations.
The Fed’s aggressive relaxation of monetary conditions in 2020 could be elevating equity values in the same manner as its monetary easing in 1998/99 and again in 2001/02.
BLOWING BUBBLES?
The revised monetary policy framework implies interest rates will be lower for any given rate of output growth and inflation than they were in the 2000s or the 2010s.
The Fed will try to run the economy at higher levels of capacity utilisation and employment without worrying so much about potential future inflation. Lower interest rates imply higher asset values, other things being equal.
If so, the positive deviation could remain, and even increase for months or years, before eventually reverting towards trend.
But the experience of the late 1990s also provides a warning: monetary policy cannot inflate asset values indefinitely without creating serious distortions and risk mispricing.
In the last century, the larger the positive deviation from trend, the larger and sharper the subsequent correction has been.
Like fiscal policy, monetary policy alters the distribution of income and wealth as well as the flow of funds around the economy.
But monetary policy does not, in itself, change the underlying technology and productivity-driven growth rate, or the long-term increase in value-added and asset values.
In the middle of a pandemic that is profoundly disrupting the economies of the United States and its trading partners, investors are pricing in a multi-year period of strong non-inflationary output growth, ultra-low interest rates and corporate value creation.

But the airline says it needs to go further.
And that means another 1,150 roles will be axed. 
Virgin says it's entering a company-wide consultation and will work with unions on the cuts.
The carrier has been hit by restrictions on British nationals going to the U.S., and expects current skeleton operations to be extended to next year.
Transatlantic flying is 70% of Virgin Atlantic's network.
It had previously said it would run out of cash at the end of September unless the rescue plan was approved.
On Thursday (September 3) a U.S. bankruptcy judge formally recognised the airline's rescue plan under the country's bankruptcy code.
The move allows a foreign debtor to shield assets from creditors in the United States.
Elsewhere, Virgin Australia was also taking steps to resolve its woes. 
The creditors of Australia's second-biggest airline voted on Friday in favour of its purchase by U.S. private equity group Bain Capital.
The deal will allow the carrier to emerge from voluntary administration, which it had entered in April.
Bain Capital said in a statement the approval was an important milestone in the airline's recovery.
Under Bain's business plan, Virgin will cut a third of its workforce.
The carrier will now focus on being a domestic and short-haul international Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 operator competing against rival Qantas."
298,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 04, 2020 10:09AM ET</span>",Labor Day Savings for Drivers Casts Pall Over Oil’s Recovery,"(Bloomberg) -- U.S. drivers can look forward to cheap gasoline heading into Labor Day Weekend, spelling hard times ahead for an oil industry that’s already been clobbered by the coronavirus.
Gasoline prices on average this year are 37 cents a gallon lower nationally than where they were a year ago, according to travel and navigation app GasBuddy. For the owner of a Ford F-150 with a 26-gallon tank, filling up is almost $10 cheaper compared with last year.
Traditionally, families hitting the road for the three-day weekend provide a capping finale to summer-driven fuel demand. This year, though, the customary drop off in consumption is especially fraught for an industry that missed out on the season’s typical profits as Covid-19 flare ups around the country depressed holiday travel. Continuing orders to stay-at-home in some of the nation’s largest school districts threaten to further delay any meaningful recovery.
“I don’t think we’ll see the big holiday jumps we’ve seen in the past,” AAA spokeswoman Jeanette Casselano said. “We’ll probably see the increases of 10 cents or so in the beaches or mountains, where you’d expect people to congregate on vacation, but increases of 3 to 5 cents will be more typical.”
The period immediately after Labor Day will be closely watched by gasoline suppliers to judge the return of back-to-school driving patterns, said Jeff Lenard, vice president at the trade group Advancing Convenience and Fuel Retailing. “The two next weeks’ demand will be the best indicator of how far the commuting and jobs market has returned,” he said.
Historically, demand is languishing. The Energy Information Administration’s moving average for product supplied, the government’s best indicator of demand, was at 8.87 million barrels a day for the week ending August 28, about 772,000 barrels a day below the five-year average.
Soon after Labor Day, gasoline prices are expected to begin their descent as refineries switch to producing fall and winter-grade gasoline. Colonial Pipeline, the nation’s largest fuel conduit that stretches from the Gulf Coast to New York Harbor, will begin shipping its first batches of the cheaper-to-make fuel next week.
Weaker prices are hitting fuel makers hard. The margin to refine a barrel of crude into fuel, as measured by futures prices, is stuck below $10 a barrel, the lowest for this time of year in almost a decade. The lower margins make it difficult to turn a profit and may prompt refineries shuttered along the U.S. Gulf Coast ahead of Hurricane Laura to remain in repose.
“I don’t think anyone is expecting any kind of monster increase in demand here down the stretch,” said Robert Yawger, director of the futures division at Mizuho Securities. “There is no demand,” he said. “So there is no reason to run refineries harder.”

299,By Investing.com,"<span>Sep 04, 2020 09:39AM ET</span>",Wall Street Whipsaws in Early Trade as Rebound Prompts Fresh Tech Selling,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened higher but quickly went into reverse on Friday, as a new wave of selling in overextended tech stocks swamped an attempted bounce.
By 10:40 AM ET (1410 GMT), the Nasdaq Composite, which bore the brunt of losses on Thursday, was down 244 points or 2.1%, after initially rising as much as 0.5%. The shift out of tech and into other, cheaper, cyclical stocks was still continuing: The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 39 points, or 0.1%, to 28,292, while the S&P 500 was down a relatively modest 0.9%.
The moves came after data showing the U.S. economy added 1.37 million jobs in August, roughly in line with the forecast - albeit the headline number was flattered by hiring ahead of the 2020 census and masked a sharp increase in the number of permanent layoffs. Even so, private-sector hiring ran at over 1 million, more than twice the estimate of ADP in its monthly survey on Wednesday.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock fell another 4.4% after its 9% fall on Thursday, while Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock fell another 3.4%, despite an initially positive opening.
Apple has now lost more than the total market value of companies as big as Exxon (NYSE:XOM), Merck or Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) this week, an illustration of how far out of kilter the gigacap tech stocks' valuation has gotten in a rally that has left the Nasdaq 25% above where it was at the start of the year.
The market remains in thrall to the army of retail traders who have driven the rally since March, despite signs of the froth coming off the most popular names. 
""Retail option trading is off the charts,"" said Randy Frederick, VP for trading and derivatives with  Charles Schwab  (NYSE:SCHW) in Austin.
""Last week, aggregate open interest (total contracts outstanding) in equity options was +25% y/o/y; this week it is +31%,"" Frederick said via Twitter. ""It must have seemed like easy money until yesterday. Caution still warranted today.""
Other stocks coming off overbought levels included DocuSign (NASDAQ:DOCU), which was down 10.2%, and Zoom Video (NASDAQ:ZM), which fell 5.0%. Zoom stock was still up more than 23% for the week after posting exceptionally strong results for the three months through July. 
After a little vacillation, the selling also filtered through to other risk assets, pushing U.S. Crude Oil Futures down 1.2% to $40.29 a barrel."
300,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 04, 2020 09:09AM ET</span>",America’s Casinos Are Desperate for More Quarters ,"(Bloomberg) -- The armored truck pulled up with $500 in quarters after Adam Wiesberg had asked for $30,000. He thought there must be a mistake.
Wiesberg was working to reopen El Cortez, the longest continuously running hotel and casino in Las Vegas. He’d requested the extra change in July to help operate the facility’s 113 coin-operated slot machines.
“People from all over the world come here, like a pilgrimage, to play the coin machines,” Wiesberg, El Cortez’s general manager, said in a phone interview. “When you walk in here, you’ll hear Sinatra, you’ll hear Rat Pack music and you’ll hear the coins.”
Casinos -- and the banks that serve them -- have been swept up in the national coin shortage, leaving many gambling venues begging customers to bring in their piggy banks and jars of change. The shortage started after the coronavirus pandemic forced many consumers to stay home, causing a dramatic slowing in the circulation of change.
Some casinos have gotten creative with their pleas. The Gun Lake Casino in Michigan told customers that if they bring in $50 worth of loose coins, they’ll receive $10 of free slot play. The D Las Vegas is home to the state’s only Sigma Derby slot machine, which lets players use quarters to place bets on five mechanical horses. The casino started a promotion called “I helped save Sigma Derby” to combat the change shortage.
“If you bring in a pound of quarters, you get a hat,” said D Las Vegas owner Derek Stevens, noting the Sigma Derby’s cult-like following. “If you bring in three pounds of quarters, you get a hat and a T-shirt.”
The promotion has netted the casino 940 pounds of quarters in recent weeks. It’s still finding pennies and nickels scarce. While coin-operated slots are less common these days -- many modern machines use a technology called “ticket-in, ticket-out” that print slips of papers that can be redeemed for cash -- those that still accept coins have a retro appeal for many gamblers.
Banks, too, have sought to persuade customers to dig between their couch cushions.  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co. branches are offering coin wrappers and encouraging clients to deposit their rolled change. The bank also exchanges paper currency for rolled coins without a fee for non-customers.
“We are actively managing our coin inventory and working with customers to meet their coin needs to the extent possible after the Federal Reserve put limitations on coin deliveries to all financial institutions nationwide,” Wells Fargo spokeswoman Beth Richek said in an email.
Minting Money
The Fed, for its part, says the shortage started after stores and bank branches shut their doors to stem the spread of Covid-19, leading to the coin-circulation problem. In response, the central bank has placed a temporary cap on the orders depository institutions can place for coins to ensure the supply is fairly distributed.
The U.S. Mint returned to full production in June, minting almost 1.6 billion coins that month, and is on track to produce 1.65 billion coins each month for the rest of the year.
“This is not a coin-supply problem -- it’s a circulation problem,” David J. Ryder, director of the Mint, said in a public service announcement last month, asking consumers to help get coins moving again by paying for goods using exact change, turning in their coins to their banks or swapping them for bills at coin-exchange kiosks. “Every little bit helps.”
Brink’s Co., the armored-truck company that helps banks and businesses manage their currency supplies, last month began asking its 10,000 employees across the U.S. to put least $5 in coins back into circulation. “This effort alone could easily contribute another $50,000 in coin to our nation’s supply,” the company said in a post on its website.
Emptying Machines
In Las Vegas, before the pandemic forced a temporary shutdown, El Cortez kept roughly $120,000 worth of coins in its vault, Wiesberg said. The casino returned all but $30,000 in change to the bank during the quarantine.
That meant El Cortez had to spring into action when it didn’t receive its full coin order in July. It removed the 5% fee it normally charges patrons to bring in mixed coins from home, and employees began emptying machines daily instead of once a week.
Wiesberg said he was heartened when his bank let him know recently that more coins would be coming in, making it easier to fill orders for his casino.
“Other places have fire and water shows and surf shows. Well, our thing is coin slot machines,” Wiesberg said. “We’re focused on providing a safe place to gamble.”

301,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 04, 2020 08:50AM ET</span>",U.S. disasters cause insurance double whammy for pandemic-hit businesses,"By Suzanne Barlyn and Alwyn Scott
(Reuters) - As insurers brace for an expensive natural-disaster season because of storms and wildfires ravaging parts of the United States, the novel coronavirus is giving them an odd financial break.
Many companies that were damaged or evacuated because of natural catastrophes were already generating far less revenue due to the pandemic. That means they will get lower payouts upon filing business-interruption claims, according to analysts, lawyers and industry sources.
It is another hit for small businesses that rebuilt after major disasters in recent years, only to see revenue screech to a halt during the pandemic, and then enter another aggressive disaster season. It could leave some companies unable to survive, said John Ellison, an attorney at Reed Smith LLP who has represented policyholders in cases stemming from hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Sandy.
""There is a reasonable chance that any business in that situation is not going to make it,"" he said. 
Claims are never simple to file or process, with insurers, lawyers and accountants quibbling over calculations. They rarely cover all losses. 
The past several months have been particularly tough for policyholders in states like California, Iowa and Louisiana. They were already battling insurers in court over pandemic claims and then suffered damage from Hurricane Laura, wildfires and a destructive, fast-moving storm that devastated parts of the Midwest.
Most disaster claims are for property damage, but a ""significant"" amount still comes from business interruption, based on the way insurers have attributed losses after major disasters, said Piper Sandler (NYSE:PIPR) analyst Paul Newsome. 
Insurers do not disclose how much of their total disaster losses are for business interruption.
The amount of payouts for disasters during the pandemic depend on the business, said Loretta Worters, a spokeswoman for the industry-funded Insurance Information Institute. A liquor store whose business is booming might have higher revenues than six months ago, she said.
Many insurers make a 12-month income projection when calculating the claim, Worters said. 
Business-interruption policies cover losses based on recent income trends, so payouts will almost certainly be lower for companies whose operations suffered because of the pandemic, said  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) analyst Mike Zaremski. Government-imposed lockdowns, supply-chain disruptions and weaker customer demand have hurt many businesses.
That is the situation in Guerneville, California, a wine region where many businesses had to evacuate because of wildfires after already being hurt by the pandemic.
For instance, Big Bottom Market, a gourmet deli there, had to close from March to May. When it re-opened, business was initially off by 40% compared with the prior year, said owner Michael Volpatt. Introducing new services like catering stemmed the tide, but July revenue was still down 9%, Volpatt said.
An Aug. 18 mandatory wildfire evacuation forced Big Bottom Market to close for 12 days. The store escaped property damage but lost over $20,000 in revenue, said Volpatt, who is preparing an insurance claim.
Business interruption was already a sore point between insurers and customers, who are battling in court about whether policies cover pandemics. Only a few of nearly 1,000 lawsuits that are pending have produced rulings, with mixed results.
Hair-salon owner Berlin Fisher is a plaintiff in one such case filed in July. A Hiscox Ltd unit denied business interruption claims for Fisher's two California salons, whose revenue was wiped out by a measure barring indoor haircuts, he said. Fisher's San Francisco salon went under as the pandemic dragged on.
A Hiscox spokesman declined comment. 
In June, Fisher began cutting hair under a tent in Guerneville to make ends meet. He evacuated four weeks later because of the fires and filed another claim, which is pending.
Fisher pays about $100 monthly for the policy, but said it may not be worth the expense.

""There's a huge discrepancy between what people who sold the insurance told me then and what actually happens,"" he said.

302,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 04, 2020 08:50AM ET</span>",Wall Street Week Ahead: U.S. stock market surge may run into scary September,"By David Randall
NEW YORK (Reuters) - A scorching stock market rally that pushed the benchmark S&P 500 to its best August in more than 30 years is entering what is historically the most volatile two-month stretch of the year, increasing the likelihood of market turbulence in the final stretch before the U.S. presidential election. 
So far, investors who bailed on the U.S. stock market due to the economic toll of the coronavirus pandemic and increasing unemployment have paid a price. The S&P 500 is near record highs and up 7% year-to-date, including an 11.5% gain since the start of July. 
The S&P 500 logged one of its few significant declines since the start of summer on Thursday, falling 3.5% as investors dumped high-flying, technology-focused stocks - sending the market's fear gauge, the CBOE Market Volatility index (VIX), near a 10-week high. 
Thursday's declines may be a preview for a rocky next two months as institutional investors return from summer vacations and refocus on the potential economic pitfalls in the year ahead, fund managers and strategists said. 
""Historically, you see low trading volumes in the summer and low information processing. That has been true this year as well,"" said Jonathan Treussard, partner at Research Affiliates. ""I can assume that on the back of pretty severe mental exhaustion from the first half of the year, a lot of people tried to unplug and are starting to get serious again now.""
Overall, the S&P 500 has fallen by an average of 0.5% in September since 1944, the largest decline of any month, and fallen on average during each election year over that span, according to research firm CFRA. The largest average losses have come in cyclical stocks including auto parts, steel and semiconductors. The best-performing months have been April and December.
October has notched the deepest historical declines of any month in both the S&P 500 and the small-cap Russell 2000, with the S&P 500 falling 21.8% and the Russell down 30.8% in 1987, according to CFRA. 
Among key events that investors are watching for this month is the Federal Reserve's policy meeting to discuss potential further steps to support the economy on Sept. 16, the central bank's last meeting before the November elections.
A breakdown in negotiations between congressional Democrats and the White House for another economic stimulus bill may further increase volatility at a time when the S&P 500 is trading near its highest valuations since the late 1990s tech boom, said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA. 
U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Tuesday that “serious differences” remain between Democrats and the White House over coronavirus relief legislation.
Following the death of more than 184,000 people in the U.S. from COVID-19, there could be increased fear of a new wave of the coronavirus. The New York City school system, the country's largest, this week pushed back its opening day in order to put more health measures in place. 
In addition, the concentration of gains in a handful of tech stocks such as Apple Inc (O:AAPL) and Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) leaves the market at a greater risk for a deep sell-off as uncertainties over the presidential election rise, said Charlie Ripley, senior investment strategist for Allianz (DE:ALVG) Investment Management.
Concerns over election uncertainty have risen because of a heavier reliance on mail-in ballots due to the pandemic. President Donald Trump has asserted, without evidence, that mail ballots would increase fraud and disrupt the November election, although experts say voter fraud of any kind is extremely rare in the United States. Trump increased those calls Wednesday by suggesting that residents of battleground state North Carolina try to vote twice, an illegal act.
The presidential election ""will bring volatility to the markets even beyond the actual election day. There is the potential things will not be decided the night of the election"" due to delays in counting mail-in votes, Ripley said. 
""Stocks are already near all-time highs,"" he said, ""so it doesn't take a lot for things to go sour.""

The electric-vehicle maker’s ongoing rout came as U.S. tech stocks fell for a second day. Thursday’s plunge sent the Nasdaq 100 Stock Index tumbling 5.2%, its biggest decline since March 16. That erased about $730 billion of value from the high-flying benchmark, which prior to Thursday’s decline had gained 78% from its March lows.
The index had previously gained in 11 of 13 sessions, hitting fresh records almost daily. Tesla had added nearly 500% this year through Monday’s close.
Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). fell 3% premarket on Friday, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN). lost 1.6%,  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT). slid 1.1%, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc. was down 1%,  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB). fell 2% and Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX). lost 2.4%.
Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives defended the sector, saying tech stocks could still have another 20% to 25% to run. Any weakness is an opportunity to buy “secular growth stories in cloud, cyber security, and tech stalwart FAANG names,” especially Apple and Microsoft, he said.
While Thursday’s “massive sell off will cause some white knuckles on the Street as fears of a tech bubble and stretched valuations become the talk of the town, we continue to believe the secular growth themes around the tech sector are unprecedented with the Covid backdrop accelerating growth stories by 1-2 years in some cases,” Ives wrote in a note."

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are set to mostly rebound Friday after the previous session’s sharp losses, although the tech sector remains weak ahead of the release of the important monthly employment report.
At 7:10 AM ET (1110 GMT), S&P 500 Futures traded flat, the Dow Futures contract rose 83 points, or 0.3%, while Nasdaq 100 Futures underperformed, after dropping 108 points, or 0.9%. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed Thursday down 2.8%, the S&P 500 fell 3.5% and the Nasdaq Composite posted a 5% drop. These indexes are on course for their worst week since mid-June.
The biggest names in technology were also the hardest hit Thursday after the sector’s prolonged bull run. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) all finished Thursday with big losses. 
The change in stance by the Federal Reserve regarding inflation, implying an easy-money policy for the foreseeable future, has helped power the stock market forward, but recent economic releases have pointed to a patchy recovery.
“High-frequency data suggests that the post-reopening surge in activity began to moderate in July and this process continued throughout August,” said ING’s James Knightley, in a research note. 
“With the pandemic continuing to create many challenges, we doubt the economy will fully heal before 2022.”
With this in mind, investors will look closely at the U.S. jobs report, due at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT), which is expected to show job growth slowed further in August.
Nonfarm payrolls are seen rising by 1.4 million jobs last month, compared with 1.763 million in July and its growth peak of 4.791 million in June.
Employment would still be about 11.5 million below its pre-pandemic level, and the slowing growth could add pressure on U.S. policymakers to restart stalled negotiations for another fiscal package.
Meanwhile, a World Health Organization spokeswoman said on Friday it does not expect widespread vaccinations against Covid-19 until the middle of next year.
In corporate news, the focus will remain on the tech sector after it had its worst day for over four months. That said, since March 23, the S&P 500 tech sector is still up about 70%.
Oil prices rebounded Friday after worries over a slow pickup in demand amid ample fuel supplies.
By 6:35 AM ET, U.S. crude futures were up 0.9% at $41.72 a barrel, while Brent futures, the international benchmark, were up 0.7% at $44.36 a barrel.

BOSTON (Reuters) - In a year shaped by health and economic crises, investors increased support for shareholder proposals that back environmental and social causes, according to data that experts say indicates a trend that will likely intensify in 2021.
A majority of shareholders, including index funds BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) and Vanguard, supported 18 environmental and social-oriented shareholder proposals during the 2020 annual meeting season, more than double last year's eight, shareholder services firm Georgeson and Proxy Insight said. In 2017, only five proposals gained support, the data showed.
At  Chevron 's (N:CVX) annual meeting, a proposal calling for reporting on climate lobbying aligned with Paris Agreement goals received 53.5% support, while at J.B. Hunt Transport Services (O:JBHT), a proposal seeking information on how the company plans to reduce its contribution to climate change drew 54.3% support.
""Climate change and sustainability continues to be a focus for many investors but with a greater sense of pressure over reporting and accountability,"" Hannah Orowitz, senior managing director at Georgeson, told Reuters.
At the same time, the report shows that shareholders appear more focused on better board oversight, having supported proposals for an independent chair this year at Baxter International (NYSE:BAX) and Boeing (NYSE:BA). The Boeing proposal received 52% support at a time when the company has been hurt by the grounding of its 737 MAX airliner after deadly crashes and suggests shareholders are concerned about the independent chair leading effectively.

In light of the coronavirus outbreak and a national focus on racism, experts say shareholders will likely press for more changes next year. ""The pandemic and the renewed focus across society on racism will mean that next year's shareholder proposal landscape may bring new kinds of proposals around social justice and anti-racism, as well as employee health and safety issues,"" Orowitz said.

308,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 04, 2020 07:02AM ET</span>",2016 all over again? Investors ready for big market moves as U.S. election nears,"By April Joyner
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Market volatility is back - and investors expect more wild swings in the coming weeks and months as the U.S. presidential election closes in. 
Regardless of who wins the Nov. 3 election, some market watchers say, markets are likely to grow more turbulent. Economic uncertainty resulting from the coronavirus pandemic still looms large, and the possibility of a delayed vote count due to a large number of mail-in ballots has also unsettled some investors. Moreover, a buildup of positions in big tech-related stocks has increased risk, as seen in a sharp market sell-off on Thursday.
""This is just a situation where all the conditions are ripe for an extraordinary profit"" from volatility, said James McDonald, chief executive of Los Angeles-based hedge fund Hercules Investments.
The Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) has climbed over the last two weeks, first as investors chased further upside in U.S. stocks through call options and then as they sought protection against a tumble in indexes at record highs. On Thursday, the VIX jumped to its highest level in nearly 10 weeks as the S&P 500 (SPX) fell 3.5%.
Several investors say that the VIX could climb further as the election approaches, especially given that certain indicators show a tightening race. In betting markets, Democratic nominee Joe Biden's lead over President Donald Trump has significantly narrowed, according to data from RealClearPolitics.
Indeed, second-month futures  on the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX), which expire in late October, point to expectations for bigger market moves around the election period. The gap between second-month futures and the VIX widened to a record high earlier this week. 
GRAPHIC: Positioning for U.S. election volatility - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/oakveojbavr/April%20-%202020%20election%20positioning%20reflected%20in%20VIX%20futures%20curve.png 
REPEATING HISTORY? 
Recent history shows that election results can have powerful effects on asset prices.
Trump's largely unexpected victory set off violent swings in markets on election night in 2016, with gold, the Mexican peso and stock futures among the assets experiencing wild gyrations. 
Earlier that year, the British pound  plunged to its lowest level against the dollar (=USD) in decades after the United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union.
This time around, a drawn-out count of mailed-in ballots could be one key catalyst for volatility, said Arnim Holzer, macro and correlation defense strategist at EAB Investment Group.
""Volatility could actually last … for longer because of the nature of the election process itself, no matter who wins,"" Holzer said.
McDonald, meanwhile, has bought December and June call options on the ProShares Ultra VIX Short-Term Futures ETF (P:UVXY), which similarly rises alongside volatility. 
He said he had already profited from Thursday's spike in volatility, which sent UVXY 20% higher to $28.90, and he anticipates that the ETF will rise to $40 before the end of the year. By actively trading UVXY as it rises, McDonald believes he can make a $1 billion profit on his $55 million investment. If UVXY were to slump below $10 close to year-end, however, McDonald would lose his remaining investment in the December calls.
The strategy could pay off, said Henry Schwartz, head of product intelligence at Cboe Global Markets (NYSE:CBOE), but even with election angst, further volatility spikes are not inevitable.
Other investors have added hedges to their portfolios. Matt Thompson, managing partner at options firm Thompson Capital Management in Chicago, holds long positions in both U.S. stocks and VIX-linked assets such as the  Barclays  (LON:BARC) iPath Series B S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures ETN (P:VXX). He expects the VIX to climb in the weeks shortly before the election, as it did in 2016.
Holding assets linked to the VIX for long periods can be money-losing, given that the index tends to revert to its long-term average rather than rise steadily.
But the recent simultaneous rise of the VIX together with U.S. stocks has made such positions profitable, Thompson said, and he expects them to hold gains as the election approaches. 

""Right now, it's a great scenario for people that are hedging,"" he said.

The overcharging, which relates to an investment product called Danske Portefoljepleje between February 2017 and July 2018, was discovered after review of a similar case, Denmark's biggest bank said.
""Our review shows that approximately 900 customers were not adequately informed about the expected negative net return for the affected low-risk strategies,"" Bente Nielsen, Danske's head of private banking in Denmark, said in a statement.
The bank said the findings came after reviewing similar problems with its Flexinvest Fri product, for which the country's financial watchdog had reported Danske to the police. 
The bank last year said it had failed to inform customers it expected poor performance from Flexinvest Fri and continued to sell it to new customers after raising fees associated with it in 2017.
In that case, Danske said it would pay out a total of around 400 million crowns in compensation to 87,000 customers.
""This (new case) is part of the Flexinvest Fri case where a number of management decisions were made in 2017 in connection with the implementation of new regulation (MiFID II),"" Danske said.

Investing.com -- Talks on a merger that would create the largest bank in Spain put a rocket under the chronically unloved European bank stock sector on Friday, reviving hopes of a wave of consolidation that would help ease nagging doubts about financial stability in the region.
Shares in  Bankia  (MC:BKIA) and Caixabank (MC:CABK) rose 26% and 12.7% respectively, after the third- and fourth-largest Spanish banks by assets said in a statement to the stock exchange after the close on Thursday they had held talks examining the possibility of an all-share deal. The news comes as Spain wrestles with a surge in Covid-19 infections after a stillborn summer tourist season that proved impossible to manage safely. The country had already had one of the longest and most severe lockdowns in Europe in the spring.
Any merged entity is likely to be dominated by Caixabank, which is not only nearly twice as large measured by assets but is also three times as large by market cap at 12.2 billion euros ($14.4 billion) compared to Bankia’s 3.95 billion.
Speculation of a broader wave of consolidation was evident in sharp rises in the shares of their smaller rivals, which would be natural takeover targets in a more concentrated field. Banco de Sabadell (MC:SABE) rose 8.9%, while  Bankinter  (MC:BKT) shares rose 4.4%.
If completed, it would create a bank with 650 billion euros in assets, the biggest in the country. But it would have a very different profile from Santander (MC:SAN) and BBVA (MC:BBVA), the current number 1 and 2, in that both Bankia and Caixabank are almost exclusively domestic.
By contrast, both Santander and BBVA get the bulk of their profits from foreign markets, notably in Latin America. However, even their shares were up by between 2.5% and 3.5% throughout the morning, on the perception that a more concentrated Spanish market would also be a more profitable one.
In a way, the mere existence of such talks is a positive sign, inasmuch as it suggests that neither is afraid of unexploded bombs in the other one’s balance sheet. That reflects the massive progress in de-risking made by Spain’s banking sector since its bailout nearly a decade ago, when it nearly collapsed under the weight of a decade-long property boom shot through with corruption.
But few with memories that long will have forgotten that Spain’s establishment had advanced similar arguments when it cobbled Bankia together out of seven struggling local savings banks. The subsequent mess cost the country billions and ended with Rodrigo Rato, the ex-IMF head who had taken the helm, in jail.
So no surprises then, that neither bank is so confident that it’s prepared to pay precious cash for a combination.
The fact that both banks are still intensely political, with Bankia majority owned by the state and Caixa by a local foundation that effectively represents the political establishment of Catalonia, can either help or hinder talks, depending on how relations between Catalonia and Spain progress.
However, they may also complicate the process of dividing inevitable job losses, given that branch reductions are the obvious opportunity for cost savings and efficiency gains.
Either way, for investors late to the party, the gains are more likely to accrue in Bankia than Caixa. The former trades at 0.2 times book value, while the latter trades at 0.4, meaning that if the market believes the two will emerge stronger from a deal, the revaluation effect will be much bigger in Bankia shares."

Veolia made a surprise bid on Sunday to acquire a 29.9% stake in Suez from Engie, the first step to a full takeover. The deal, deemed “particularly hostile” by Suez Chief Executive Officer Bertrand Camus, would create a global waste and water giant with more than 40 billion euros in revenue as global warming and pollution boosts the need to recycle resources and treat hazardous products.
“The value of Suez is higher than the basis of these discussions,” as shown by the 5.7% jump in Veolia shares Monday, Clamadieu said on BFM Business television Friday. He asked Suez to come up with another offer, and said that Engie will consider an alternative bid “with great care if it can be implemented rapidly.”
Speaking on BFM Business television Thursday, Suez Chairman Philippe Varin reiterated his support for Camus and his plan to turn around the company. The board has encouraged the CEO to seek alternatives to Veolia’s offer, Varin said.
Veolia’s bid got some support Thursday from the French government, which owns 24% in Engie, when Prime Minister Jean Castex said the proposed deal “makes sense.”
Any bid for part or all of Suez must preserve jobs and avoid the creation of monopolies in water and waste, Castex said, adding that he’d rather have French investors in Suez to avoid “a loss of sovereignty in this strategic industry.”
Clamadieu asked Veolia and Suez to hold talks to see if Veolia can raise its offer and make it more “inclusive” for Suez’s management and employees. The project to create a French giant in environmental services is “attractive in some ways,” he said.
Suez shares were trading 1.8% higher at 15.14 euros at 11:01 a.m. in Paris, nearing Veolia’s 15.50 euro-per-share offer. The stock surged 19% on Monday, the first trading day after Veolia’s move."

Citi said in a research note that one in two new exchange-traded fund (ETF) launches in Europe, the Middle East and Africa so far in 2020 were ESG-linked.
Investors have poured $4.2 billion of assets into these 52 new funds, against $3.8 billion for new non-ESG funds. The ratios are far lower in other regions, with 12% of new assets in the United States going into ESG-linked funds and just 3.7% in Asia.
Demand for ESG investments has ballooned in recent years, particularly in Europe, driven in part by growing evidence that companies that perform well on various ESG criteria tend to outperform over the longer term.
""As ESG frameworks mature and standardize they will increasingly get incorporated into the investment process of a broader range of investors,"" Citi analyst Kim D Jensen said in Friday's research note.
""As such the trend is likely to continue into 2021 with ESG versions of ETFs across more and more ETF categories becoming available and not just on major geographical indices.""
This year has provided several reminders of the risks to investors of ESG-related problems, most starkly the case of Wirecard. The German payments firm and once stock market darling, collapsed into insolvency in June after disclosing a 1.9-billion-euro hole in its accounts.
Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) estimates that more than $600 billion of S&P 500 company market capitalisation alone has been lost to ""ESG controversies"" in the last seven years.

314,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 04, 2020 05:05AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Taking power - Chinese firm to run Laos electric grid amid default warnings,"By Keith Zhai and Kay Johnson
(Reuters) - The poor, small Southeast Asian country of Laos is set to cede majority control of its electric grid to a Chinese company, as it struggles to stave off a potential debt default, people with direct knowledge of the agreement said.
The deal comes at a time when critics accuse Beijing of ""debt trap diplomacy"" to gain strategic advantage in countries struggling to repay loans taken out under President Xi Jinping's global ""Belt and Road"" infrastructure initiative. 
China is Laos's biggest creditor, and the deal will bind the landlocked, mountainous country of seven million people closer to its giant neighbour. 
The power grid shareholding deal was signed on Tuesday between state-owned Electricite du Laos (EdL) and China Southern Power Grid Co., according to Chinese state news agency Xinhua, which did not give details of the new ownership.
Three people with knowledge of the matter said it would give majority control of the new Electricite du Laos Transmission Company Limited (EDLT) to the Chinese company.
Power exports are central to Laos's development plans.
""It will give the Laos state grid better bargaining power with regional countries and start to make a profit,"" said one of the people with direct knowledge of the discussions.
China's embassy in Laos said on its website that Laos would operate the transmission assets. It did not give shareholding details but said ""Laos can also gradually repurchase shares during the operation.""
Neither EdL nor China Southern responded to Reuters requests for comment on the deal. The Laos and Chinese governments did not respond to requests for comment either. 
Reporting from the Laos capital Vientiane, Xinhua quoted Laos energy and mines minister Khammany Inthirath as calling it a key project which would benefit from the Chinese company's ""advantages in experience, technology and human resources.""
The new company will operate under Laos government regulation, Xinhua reported, but would take advantage of China Southern's ""financial strength and mature experiences in power grid construction, operation and management.""
The state-run Vientiane Times said after the deal that EDLT would in future invest about $2 billion in the local grid and international connections.
Laos has spent heavily on hydroelectric schemes, many financed by China, with the aim of becoming ""The Battery of Southeast Asia"". But those projects, along with a new Chinese high speed railway, are at the centre of a debt crunch.
DEFAULT WARNING
The World Bank estimated in June that debt levels would reach up to 68 percent of GDP in 2020, from 59 percent last year. Rating agency Moody's (NYSE:MCO) warned last month of ""a material probability of default in the near term.""
While Laos has recorded only 22 coronavirus cases and no deaths, the epidemic has hit tourism and overseas remittances hard.
Laos debt service obligations in 2020 are around $1.2 billion with loans from commercial banks and Thai bonds maturing in September and October, Moody's said, but foreign reserves were just $864 million in June, according to the central bank.
Among companies suffering delayed payments already are the Chinese firms behind hydroelectric projects that were not paying back as expected, the people with knowledge of the China Southern agreement said.
China was also considering postponing part of Laos' total debt service payments, two people with direct knowledge said. China's government did not immediately respond to a question on the discussions.
""Economically Laos is going to depend more on China and this is inevitable,"" said Toshiro Nishizawa, a Japanese professor who has advised the Laos government on fiscal stability.
Laos could be eligible for help by the International Monetary Fund under its COVID-19 Financial Assistance and Debt Service Relief response, from which 80 countries are benefiting, two Western diplomats said.
But they said it had made clear it would rather try to find a solution with China, they said. An IMF deal would require greater financial transparency.
Total Chinese investment in power, transport, a border economic zone and other projects already totals over $10 billion, according to Xinhua citing figures from Laos. That is more than double investment by Thailand, the next biggest.
A study published in 2019 by the Australia-based Lowy Institute put Laos debt to China at 45 percent of GDP.
The economic relationship with Beijing has also strengthened political ties, with Laos a reliable backer of China's position on matters such as the South China Sea in the regional Association of Southeast Asian Nations.
Laos was the first country to endorse Chinese leader Xi’s political message of “building of community of common destiny”.

""Giving China a major stake in the 'Battery of Southeast Asia Plan' puts Laos fast on the track of becoming a pseudo-province of China,"" said Brian Eyler, Southeast Asia programme director of the Stimson Center think-tank in Washington.

With Sino-U.S. relations deteriorating over various issues including coronavirus, trade and technology, global financial markets are increasingly worried if China would sell the U.S. government debt it holds as a weapon to counter rising U.S. pressure.
""China will gradually decrease its holdings of U.S. debt to about $800 billion under normal circumstances,"" Xi Junyang, a professor at the Shanghai University of Finance and Economics, was quoted as saying on Thursday, without giving a detailed timeframe.
""But of course, China might sell all of its U.S. bonds in an extreme case, like a military conflict.""
China, the second largest non-U.S. holder of Treasuries, held $1.074 trillion in June, down from $1.083 trillion the previous month, according to latest official data.
China has steadily decreased its holdings of the U.S. bonds this year, although some market watchers suspect China may not have necessarily sold U.S. Treasuries as it may have used other custodians to purchase Treasuries.
Dropping to $800 billion from the current level could mean shrinking its holdings by more than 25%. Analysts say large-scale Chinese selling, often referred to as the ""nuclear option"", could trigger turmoil on global financial markets.
Another reason the state newspaper cited was the potential default risk in the United States as the debt of the world's largest economy has surged sharply to about the same size of its gross domestic product, a level not seen since the end of the World War Two and well above the internationally recognized safety line of 60%.
China is heavily exposed to the U.S. dollar and dollar-denominated assets. Its official foreign exchange reserves stood at $3.154 trillion at the end of July.

LONDON/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - World shares edged lower on Friday, and were on course for their worst week in more than two months, though gains in safer assets like bonds and the dollar were muted as investors awaited U.S. jobs data to see if it triggers a bigger sell-off.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index added 0.4%, rebounding from its worst day in more than a month a day before amid a tech-led plunge on Wall Street on Thursday.
Data showed German industrial goods orders rose by a smaller-than-expected 2.8% on the month in July, undermining hopes of recovery for Europe's largest economy from the coronavirus shock.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 1.3% and looked set to snap a six-week winning streak with its biggest weekly loss since April. Japan's benchmark Nikkei share average closed down 1.1%.
The MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 49 countries and had touched record highs earlier on Thursday, shed 0.1%.
""Stock market valuation is rich on a stand-alone basis, but far less extreme compared to other asset classes. Hence, it's likely a bit too soon to be calling the next bear market even though September 3 did mark the top of the equity market back in 1929,"" said Jeroen Blokland, portfolio manager at Robeco.
Futures were under pressure, but not as much as earlier in the session. Nasdaq 100 futures were down 0.8% and S&P 500 futures down 0.2%.
Focus is now on U.S. payrolls figures due at 1230 GMT, which could be a selling trigger if an expected slowdown in hiring is deeper than forecast.
""I don't think a huge number of investors will be adjusting their positions ahead of the U.S. payroll data but because of yesterday's sell-off there will be a bit more sensitivity to the data,"" said James Athey, investment director at Aberdeen Standard Investments.
""U.S. jobs data has been pretty consistently awful in a big picture sense. Fundamentally, there is nothing that can happen in payrolls that can tell you much more about the trajectory of the economy.""
Foreign exchange markets were on edge at the possibility and a safety bid helped the dollar cling to gains that have it headed for its best week in more than two months. [FRX/]
The euro, which has fallen from a 28-month peak above $1.20 on talk the European Central Bank is concerned about its strength, seems to have eased its slide for now, and last sat at $1.1839.
The yen was steady at 106.14 per dollar and bonds pared what was a pretty modest rise overnight, given the sell-off in the equity market.
Elsewhere, Turkey's lira weakened for a fifth straight session to a new record low as pressure rose on the central bank to tighten credit amid stubbornly high inflation.
Benchmark U.S. 10-year bond yields rose about 2 basis points on Friday, having fallen overnight. [US/]
German yields stabilised, having fallen the day before on equity sell-offs.
TECH TUMBLE
Thursday's tumble was the biggest one-day percentage drop on the tech-focused Nasdaq 100 since March and the darling stocks of recent months were hit hardest. (N)
Still, the plunge in Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) only wound the Nasdaq back as far as where it sat last Tuesday. It is still up 28% for the year so far and 73% higher than its March trough.
""No single factor sparked the sell-off,"" said Kerry Craig, Global Market Strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management, citing more general worries the rally had run too far, too fast.
""However, this is unlikely to be a repeat of the tech wreck of the late 1990s, given how much the market and sector have changed,"" he added.
Tech selling in Asia was limited. In South Korea Samsung (KS:005930) fell 1.4% and there was modest pressure on Apple suppliers in Shanghai and Taipei. But falls in consumer staples and financials led losses on the Hong Kong and China bourses. 
In commodity markets, oil was headed for its largest weekly drop since June amid worries about demand as the U.S. summer driving season draws to a close.
Brent crude futures were flat at $44.07 a barrel and U.S. crude was also trading sideways $41.38 a barrel. [O/R]

(Reuters) - European shares overcame early losses on Friday, with bank stocks leading gains on merger talks between two major Spanish lenders, while markets bet on the European Central Bank maintaining easy monetary policy at a meeting next week.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index (STOXX) rose 0.5% after falling as much as 1% at the open. It had marked its worst session in more than a month on Thursday after a rout in U.S. technology stocks spread to other sectors and markets.
Spanish banks  Bankia  (MC:BKIA) and Caixabank (MC:CABK) both marked double-digit gains after they said they were considering a merger to create the biggest lender in Spain.
Caixabank topped the bank index (SX7P) — which outperformed its European peers — while bolstering the Spanish benchmark (IBEX). The stock was also the biggest gainer on the STOXX 600.
Still, the STOXX 600 has stayed well within a trading range seen since June, as a euro zone economic recovery appeared to be running out of steam. It was set to end the week a shade lower.
A batch of middling economic data this week bolstered expectations that the ECB would maintain an accommodative stance to bolster inflation, in line with the U.S. Federal Reserve.
""The Fed's decision to move to an average inflation target has set the scene... given the still high level of uncertainty surrounding any economic outlook, the ECB is highly unlikely to change its policy stance at next week's meeting,"" Carsten Brzeski, chief economist, eurozone and global head of macro at ING wrote in a note.
With European interest rates in negative territory, the ECB has undertaken massive bond-buying programs this year to boost liquidity through the coronavirus crisis.
Investors now eye U.S. payroll data, due later in the day, to gauge the pace of the country's economic recovery, with Wall Street futures trading negative after Thursday's massive losses.
Technology shares (SX8P) inched higher after posting their worst session in more than four months in the previous session. 

Real estate stocks (SX86P) were among the few losing sectors for the day, led by Germany's Vonovia (DE:VNAn) after it announced a 1-billion euro ($1.18 billion) capital raise.

318,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 04, 2020 04:30AM ET</span>",Just Eat Takeaway COO sees GrubHub as well positioned,"BERLIN (Reuters) - European food-ordering firm Just Eat Takeaway.com NV thinks GrubHub (NYSE:GRUB) is better positioned than rivals to prosper in the United States even though it has been pushed into third place, its operating chief told Reuters.
The food delivery business has seen a land grab in the last year as companies vie for the market leading positions they say they need to keep customers coming back to their apps.
Netherlands-based Takeaway sealed the acquisition of Britain's Just Eat, a company larger than itself, in January and the combined firm then agreed in June to buy U.S. peer GrubHub for $7.3 billion.
The GrubHub acquisition should be completed in the first half of 2021 and the company is well positioned to succeed, Just Eat Takeaway's Chief Operating Officer Joerg Gerbig said in an interview in the company's offices in Berlin.
""GrubHub is profitable. The largest market by far is New York. The company is particularly well represented on the East Coast,"" Gerbig said.
The company's main rivals including Uber Eats, Deliveroo and Delivery Hero are still loss-making.
Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc, which had itself been eyeing GrubHub, said in July it would acquire Postmates Inc, giving it roughly a 30% share of the U.S. food delivery market, trailing DoorDash on some 45%, and leaving GrubHub in third place on 23%.
Just Eat Takeaway reported first-half revenue rose 44% to 1.03 billion euros ($1.22 billion) as the coronavirus lockdown led to a surge in orders, though its net loss rose to 158 million euros due to 152 million euros of acquisition-related costs.
Gerbig said the company puts a bigger focus on signing up restaurants which do their own deliveries than its rivals.
""If we just delivered the food ourselves, like other market players, we would never become profitable,"" he said.
Gerbig does not expect the firm's own deliveries to become profitable on the European mainland due to the high cost of drivers, but it is still worth doing because it attracts more restaurants, and therefore customers, to the platform.
He said the company had no plans to follow Delivery Hero and UberEats and expand into delivering everyday goods and groceries because they carry such low margins: ""I wonder how you can ever make it profitable.""

Just Eat Takeaway is also looking to offload a minority stake it acquired along with Just Eat, in Brazil's iFood: ""If the right price is offered, we are ready to sell,"" Gerbig said.

Norwegian Air Shuttle (OL:NORR) stock fell 6.5% after the troubled airline saw a 91% decline in August passenger volume from a year earlier as most of its fleet remained grounded by the coronavirus pandemic.
Staying with airlines, Ryanair  (LON:RYA) rose 2.7% after it managed to raised 400 million euros in a share sale announced after the close Thursday.
On the flip side, real estate company Vonovia dropped 3.9% after launching a capital Increase of approximately 1 billion euros.
Engie (PA:ENGIE) stock fell 0.2% after its chairman said that Veolia's (PA:VIE) offer for Engie's stake in rival Suez (PA:SEVI) is too low, putting pressure on the bidder. Veolia dropped 0.5%, while Suez rose 0.9%.
Earlier Friday, German industrial goods orders rose by a smaller-than-expected 2.8% on the month in July, but June’s figures were revised up to show an increase of 28.8% from 27.9% previously reported.
Investors are now looking ahead to the closely-watched U.S. jobs report later Friday, which is expected to show job growth slowed further in August.
Nonfarm payrolls are seen rising by 1.4 million jobs last month, helped by hiring for the 2020 Census. Employment increased 1.763 million in July and its growth peaked at 4.791 million in June.
Employment would still be about 11.5 million below its pre-pandemic level, and the slowing growth could add pressure on U.S. policymakers to restart stalled negotiations for another fiscal package.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 2.8% on Wall Street Thursday, the biggest fall since June, while the S&P 500 fell 3.5% and the Nasdaq Composite posted a 5% drop, hit by drops in the biggest names in technology.
Oil prices edged higher Friday, stabilising after recent heavy losses amid worries over a slow pickup in demand amid ample fuel supplies.

Veolia last Sunday offered 2.9 billion euros ($3.4 billion), or 15.50 euros per share, for the 29.9% of Suez held by Engie, as a prelude to launching a full takeover bid.
Suez flagged uncertainties about the deal and has said it would be keen for alternative offers to emerge, although the next step rests with Engie, which is pushing back on the price. 
""It's not where it should be,"" Engie Chairman Jean-Pierre Clamadieu told BFM Business TV. 
Clamadieu said some elements of Veolia's offer were attractive, including that it could be a swift solution. Engie is shedding assets to refocus its most profitable businesses. 
But he added Engie would also examine any other offers that cropped up. 
Veolia has argued buying Suez would help create a French champion in the water and waste management industry that would be better placed to fend off emerging competition from Chinese rivals. 
It has sought to pre-empt possible antitrust problems by already agreeing to sell Suez's French water activities to infrastructure fund Meridiam, for an undisclosed amount, if the takeover goes through.

The budget carrier has said it will fly 25-30 of its aircraft in the months ahead, while more than 100 remain parked.
Creditors and lessors took control of Norwegian in May with a financial rescue that allowed it to access state-guaranteed loans of 3 billion Norwegian crowns ($336 million) and thus prevent a collapse.

""The prolonged crisis that has impacted every part of the aviation industry continues to create uncertainty in all markets, making the need for a long-term liquidity support package even more critical to protect tourism, jobs and international trade,"" CEO Jacob Schram said.

Tianjin Tongrong is owned by Zhang Yiming, the founder and CEO of ByteDance.
""The acquisition is to supplement the existing major payment options, and to ultimately enhance user experience on our multiple platforms in China,"" ByteDance said in a statement sent to Reuters on Friday, without elaborating.
Established in 2012, UIPay obtained a third-party payment license from China's central bank in 2014. There were reports of ByteDance acquiring UIPay in 2018, but ByteDance had downplayed the news and said the two were only business partners.
ByteDance has been hiring globally, and notably in Singapore, for a team that would be in charge of building a network and a platform providing cross-border payments solutions for the firm, according to LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) ads.
Two sources said ByteDance had applied for a digital banking license in Singapore, which the firm has declined to comment on.
At home, ByteDance has also been leveraging its online finance business. 
It obtained a licence for micro-lending in July, and is taking steps to move into the online stock brokerage and wealth management business in Hong Kong.

ByteDance has been ordered by U.S. President Donald Trump to divest TikTok in America or face a ban amid security concerns over the personal data it handles.

LONDON (Reuters) - With an enviable reputation, IAG's CEO Willie Walsh would be a hard act to follow at the best of times, but his successor Luis Gallego will have to steer its British Airways and Iberia out of the depths of the worst downturn in aviation history. 
A former pilot and dealmaker, Walsh created IAG by dragging two old-fashioned flag carriers into the modern age of budget flying, taking a tough line on unions and cutting costs to build a group that for years outperformed traditional European peers.
As a key player within IAG, Gallego took the helm of Iberia in 2013 and was credited with turning the Spanish airline around. His task now will be to cut group costs while managing damaged relations with unions and politicians and stepping up the battle with low-cost Ryanair (I:RYA) and easyJet (L:EZJ).
Gallego steps into the role on Sept. 8 and said of his new tenure: ""Our idea is to compete with everybody.""
The world looked very different when Walsh announced his retirement in January. He was set to leave on a high, with IAG's (L:ICAG) share price and profits close to record levels.
Weeks later COVID-19 hit, and airlines were in the eye of the storm. With one of the world's largest airline groups bleeding cash, he postponed his retirement to steady the ship.
On the day he bows out IAG expects to raise 2.75 billion euros ($3.25 billion) at its annual meeting from shareholders in a rights issue which is backed by its biggest shareholder Qatar. 
""Major shareholders are satisfied that IAG's equity raise will be enough to weather the crisis… or at least that's their hope,"" said one banking source.
The group has already slashed costs at British Airways, with 12,000 jobs set to go and new terms for some long-serving staff. 
Unions have vowed to fight the cuts and the British government said the plan was a ""breach of faith"" after the airline accessed state funds to pay wages during the crisis.
A motion to approve Walsh's incentive bonus of 883,000 pounds at the meeting could inflame tensions. The Institutional Shareholder Services group said it should be rejected. 
Another challenge on the horizon is the need to renegotiate the price of Air Europa, the Spanish airline which IAG agreed to buy pre-crisis.
His job will also not be made any easier by the stop-start nature of flying and the impact COVID-19 is having on IAG's key routes, including Britain, Spain and the United States. 
But Gallego does have reasons to be optimistic. Unlike Air France-KLM (PA:AIRF) and Lufthansa (DE:LHAG), IAG was not bailed out by government and retains its independence and speed of movement. 
""Their main competitor for European consolidation, Lufthansa, just dropped out of the race"", said Bernstein analyst Daniel Roeska. 
""Our bigger question over the next three years is, will they come up with the next big thing?"" said Roeska. ""Will Luis be able to phrase a strategy for the group that convinces employees, convinces shareholders to go with him?""
Walsh, one of the most experienced bosses in the industry, said he will be watching ""with interest from a distance"". 
He shrugged off questions about his own next move, telling analysts on a final call he would be ""in Mary Mac's Pub, and a few other nice pubs in Dublin"".

SYDNEY (Reuters) -  Virgin Australia  Holdings Ltd's (AX:VAH) creditors voted on Friday in favour of the purchase of Australia's second-biggest airline by U.S. private equity group Bain Capital, administrator Deloitte said, paving the way for a strategic overhaul.
The deal will allow the carrier to emerge from voluntary administration, which it had entered in April owing A$7 billion ($5 billion) to creditors after suffering from a sharp plunge in demand due to the coronavirus pandemic.
The Bain deal gives unsecured creditors a return of 9% to 13% of their investment and involves a financial commitment of A$3.5 billion, according to administrator Deloitte, which said Virgin shares should be transferred to the private equity group by Oct. 31.
Bain Capital Managing Director Mike Murphy said in a statement the purchase approval was an important milestone in the airline's recovery. 
Under Bain's business plan, Virgin plans to cut a third of its workforce as part of an overhaul to focus on being a domestic and short-haul international  Boeing Co  (N:BA) 737 operator competing against Qantas Airways Ltd (AX:QAN).
Virgin Chief Executive Paul Scurrah said on Wednesday that the airline was likely to cede some market share to Qantas as it exited unprofitable routes.
Before the pandemic, Virgin had spent a decade transforming itself from a low-cost carrier to a full-service rival to Qantas competing for corporate travellers, but that came at the cost of years of losses.
Virgin will still seek corporate business but it plans to market itself more as a value-for-money option rather than chasing large accounts at any cost, Scurrah said at the CAPA Australia Pacific Aviation Summit on Wednesday.
""Travel budgets are going to be under more pressure than ever when things come back,"" he said. ""Our lower cost base allows us to compete more aggressively as a value carrier.""

HONG KONG/BENGALURU (Reuters) - Indian companies have raised a record $31 billion in equity capital in 2020, Refinitiv data showed, as banks strengthen their balance sheets to prepare for future economic uncertainty and corporates tap into the elevated global liquidity levels.
The record raising comes despite India's economy contracting 23.9% in the June-quarter, year on year, which puts it on track for the first annual contraction since 1980.
The rush of deals though has not been extended to initial public offerings (IPOs), which have fallen to a five-year low to be worth just $1.5 billion, in the eight months year to date, the data showed.
(Graphic: Indian companies' equity offerings, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/xlbvglmewpq/equity%20offerings.jpg)
Banks have been the most active issuers, raising $13.68 billion, followed by the energy and power sector with $7.05 billion, and consumer products with $3.41 billion.

 Reliance Industries ' (NS:RELI) $7-billion raising in June was the country's largest, the data showed, as the company turned net debt-free and is now looking to expand its consumer business by acquiring Future Group's retail arm.
Real estate companies were identified by corporate advisors as the most likely candidates to tap the markets further in 2020 as property demand is expected to return after the disruption caused by the coronavirus crisis.
Surging cash levels – helped by $15 trillion of stimulus made available for economies to withstand the fallout of the pandemic was primarily responsible for the raising rush, advisors said.
""We expect issuance to expand further to growth capital in the coming weeks and months, and the pipeline is developing across sectors,"" said  Citigroup 's (N:C) India head of banking and capital markets Ravi Kapoor.
EY India partner Sandip Khetan said the banks' raisings helped created ""a cushion to the potential losses on account of credit losses"" that could occur in the future.
Foreign appetite to buy Indian equities has risen sharply, with investors outside India buying $10.3 billion of new shares in the three months to August, the Refinitiv data showed.

Investing.com – Asian stocks were mostly down on Friday morning, following the lead of U.S. markets, which saw their biggest slump in months, led downward by tech stocks.
There was no single reason for the sharp slump in U.S. markets, with analysts pointing to either increased volatility or the more typical September sell-off for the drop, which was led by some of the biggest names in technology.
“It’s too soon to say whether this is a pause that refreshes or whether this is the beginning of a more meaningful downturn in big tech,” Nancy Prial, co-chief executive at Essex Investment Management told Bloomberg. “Most of these are great companies with really robust growth opportunities, but the stocks are very richly valued.”
Asian markets were set to close off the week by following U.S. markets down.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 was down 1.09% by 10:05 PM ET (2:05 AM GMT) giving up gains from a day earlier. The Nikkei gained 1% on Thursday, which brought it back to its pre-pandemic levels, supported by the bull run in the U.S. and the emergence of Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga as a candidate to succeed outgoing Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.
China’s Shanghai Composite was down 1.45% while the Shenzhen Component, which is heavier on tech stocks, opened down 1.69%.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index was down 1.71%, even as the city moved to relax some social distancing measures, extend dine-in hours at restaurants and allow gyms to reopen from today.
South Korea’s KOSPI was down 1.49%.
In Australia, the S&P/ASX 200 led the down day by falling 2.63%.
In the U.S., the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 2.78%, the biggest fall since June, while the S&P 500 fell 3.46% and the Nasdaq Composite clocked in a 4.96% fall. The biggest names in technology were also the biggest losers after a weeks-long bull run. Apple (NASDAQ:NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon (NASDAQ:NASDAQ:AMZN), Facebook (NASDAQ:NASDAQ:FB) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:NASDAQ:GOOGL) all finished Thursday with big losses.
“There has been no obvious catalyst for the move,” wrote Rodrigo Catril of National Australia Bank (OTC:NABZY) in a note. “Now the question is whether the correction has legs or whether investors are tempted back in.”
The stock market losses happened despite jobs data that was better than expected, with the U.S. Department of Labor reporting that initial jobless claims fell to 881,000 for the week to Aug. 28, lower than forecasts of 950,000.
Investors are now looking ahead to July retail sales data from Australia as well as a U.S. jobs report on Friday that is expected to show a rebound in August."
334,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 03, 2020 09:50PM ET</span>","Hong Kong financial firms step up compliance hiring amid U.S. sanctions, security law","By Alun John and Sumeet Chatterjee
HONG KONG (Reuters) - Financial firms in Hong Kong are scrambling to fortify their compliance operations following U.S. sanctions and China's new national security law, even as the sector pushes to cut costs amid the coronavirus pandemic.
This underscores the growing challenges for firms operating in the Asian financial hub, which was roiled last year by often-violent pro-democracy, anti-China protests and is now in the crosshairs of mounting Sino-U.S. tensions. 
International asset managers and Asian banks have stepped up compliance hiring, while some are training existing staff and buying new technology to offset a talent crunch as candidates are unwilling to relocate amid the health crisis and the uncertainty in Hong Kong, bankers, lawyers and headhunters said.
Demand for compliance staff has risen by as much as a third from a few months earlier, two headhunters said.
""In the past three months we've had demand from top-tier asset managers looking for regulatory compliance lawyers because they need experts in place when the U.S. and China keep slapping sanctions on each other,"" said Olga Yung, regional director at recruiter Michael Page Hong Kong.
Because sanctions are a ""niche area"", companies are hiring lawyers with some sanctions expertise and supplementing with external law firms, she said. 
'AN ACTIVE MANDATE'
The United States has imposed sanctions on Hong Kong's Chief Executive Carrie Lam and 10 other officials for what it says is their role in curtailing political freedoms in the territory.
The sanctions came after Beijing imposed in late June a sweeping security law on Hong Kong, targeting seditious and subversive activities.
A senior banker at an Asian lender in Hong Kong said he gave his compliance team a list of individuals and businesses linked to the sanctioned officials and ""the immediate response was to either close all those accounts or hire five more sanction-specialists to do a proper audit"". 
The banker, declining to be named because the information was private, said they decided to hire two experts and organise sanctions training for the rest of the team, despite a company-wide attempt to limit spending. 
Chinese banks are also hiring. 
A headhunter said his firm received ""an active mandate"" from two of China's Big Four banks for compliance experts in Hong Kong following the U.S. sanctions, without giving their names.
The penalties levied for breaching sanctions can be large. 
Global banks operating in Hong Kong, including HSBC (L:HSBA) and  Standard Chartered  (L:STAN), paid billions of dollars in fines in recent years for violating U.S. sanctions on Iran and anti-money laundering rules.
READING TEA LEAVES
It is a Catch-22 situation for financial firms in Hong Kong.
There are worries that firms implementing sanctions could run afoul of the security law. But banks also must guard their access to the U.S. financial system. 
The security law and the U.S. legislation are broadly worded and give much discretion to enforcement officers, adding to the uncertainty, lawyers said. 
This has pushed up the need for professionals, and means advising on compliance is like ""reading tea leaves"", one added.
""The phone is ringing off the hook, and everyone doesn't only want work done, they want it immediately,"" said Benjamin Kostrzewa, an international trade and regulatory lawyer at Hogan Lovells. ""It's hard to even sign the engagement letter before the next client walks into the Zoom room"".
However, meeting the demand is difficult. Until recently there was limited need for specific U.S. sanctions knowledge in Hong Kong's legal and financial industries. 
Recruitment from rival financial hubs has been curtailed because of virus-related curbs and political uncertainty in Hong Kong, say headhunters.
Some companies are using technology to bridge the gap. 

A year ago ""we were very focused on banks, but now clients are insurers and even casinos and real estate companies"", said Bharath Vellore, APAC managing director at Accuity, which provides financial crime and sanctions lists screening software.

LONDON (Reuters) - British sandwich and coffee chain Pret A Manger said on Friday it would launch a subscription service for drinks, trying out a new business model to help it survive the coronavirus crisis, which has hammered its sales.
Owned by investment group JAB Holdings, Pret cut 2,800 jobs or a third of its workforce last month and reported sales across its UK shops down 60% year-on-year.
Pret has 367 shops in the United Kingdom, with many located on high streets, at transport hubs and close to offices that are still largely deserted, with people preferring to work from home.
With weekly sales back where they were a decade ago, Pret will be making one of the first high-profile innovations by a well-known company to take on the new landscape created by the pandemic.
From next Tuesday, it will offer a subscription service allowing customers to have a barista-prepared drink, including coffees, teas, hot chocolates, smoothies and frappes, up to five times a day for 20 pounds per month.
While the service will provide guaranteed income, Pret runs the risk of losing out if customers use their full allowance. 
Pret said the subscription service was the first of its kind in the UK, though similar schemes exist in the United States.
All customers signing up to the mobile ""YourPret Barista"" service also get a month of free drinks starting from Tuesday.
""Subscription services like Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Spotify (NYSE:SPOT) have played a big part in keeping us positive throughout lockdown and after seeing on social media how excited customers were to be reunited with their favourite Pret drinks, we've been inspired to launch our own,"" said Pret's UK food & coffee director Briony Raven (NASDAQ:RAVN).
Pret has also launched new products, designed to reach customers in new ways. Examples include ""Heat Me at Home"" meals, its first ever range of ground coffee and espresso beans, sold via Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and a new dinner menu available for delivery.

Pret is not alone in its struggles. On Thursday rival Costa Coffee (N:KO) said a restructuring brought about by COVID-19 meant it could shed up to 1,650 jobs.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The founder of a New York hedge fund was criminally charged on Thursday with pressuring a rival not to bid for assets related to Neiman Marcus' bankruptcy so he could buy them at a lower price, the U.S. Department of Justice said on Thursday.
Daniel Kamensky, whose Marble Ridge Capital LP specialized in ""distressed"" investing and is liquidating its assets, was charged with securities fraud, wire fraud, extortion and bribery related to bankruptcy, and obstruction of justice. 
Kamensky appeared briefly in Manhattan federal court, where bail was set at $250,000. His lawyers did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Prosecutors said Kamensky's scheme began on July 31, when he learned an investment bank bid around 30 cents per share for securities tied to Neiman's bankruptcy, above the 20 cents he hoped to pay.
Kamensky, 47, of Roslyn, New York, allegedly threatened to use his role as co-chair of the retailer's official committee of unsecured creditors to block the higher bid, and stop doing business with the bank unless it backed off.
Prosecutors said after the bank withdrew its bid, Kamensky tried to cover his tracks by asking an employee there in a recorded call to tell the committee and law enforcement he suggested the bank bid only if it were serious.
""Do you understand ... I can go to jail,"" Kamensky was quoted as saying.
""I honestly ... don't want anything to do with this,"" the employee responded.
""My position ... is going to be look, this was a huge misunderstanding,"" Kamensky said. ""They're going to say that I abused my position as a fiduciary, which I probably did, right?""
In a voluntary interview taken later under oath, Kamensky called his conversations with the employee a ""terrible mistake"" and ""profound errors in lapses of judgment,"" prosecutors said.
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filed related civil charges.
Marble Ridge had $1.2 billion of assets as of Dec. 31. It announced the liquidation on Aug. 20 after Kamensky's conduct began falling under scrutiny.
Kamensky founded Marble Ridge in 2015 after working as a bankruptcy lawyer and a partner for the hedge fund firm Paulson & Co.

Neiman filed for Chapter 11 protection in May.

The ISM non-manufacturing index slowed to a reading of 56.9 last month, from 58.1 in July, missing economists' forecasts for a reading of 57, which Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) called a modest decline.
Here are three things that may move markets tomorrow:
1. Tech slaughter
Tech stocks led the market to slaughter on Thursday. Will they keep up the momentum? 
Apple, which pulled the Dow lower, led the stumble among the Fab 5 tech stocks, which include Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX).
Stay-at-home tech favorites Chegg (NYSE:CHGG),  Zoom Video Communications  Inc (NASDAQ:ZM) and  Crowdstrike Holdings Inc  (NASDAQ:CRWD) also tumbled, though the coronavirus pandemic hasn't yet dissipated, and no vaccine has been approved. We get earnings from DocuSign (NASDAQ:DOCU) after the market close on Thursday, which, if it beats, could provide a tiny spark of hope in the segment.
2. Jobs  
The August jobs report is out in the morning at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT). Non-farm payrolls are expected to come at 1.4 million. That compares to July's 1.7 million. The level of unemployment may have fallen slightly to 9.8% from the previous 10.2%.
3. Holiday weekend
Markets tend to be slower ahead of holiday weekend, but this one may be an exception after the roller-coaster week we've had. Labor Day on Monday means a much-needed break for investors. It also marks the unofficial end of summer and return to school, whatever that may mean from where you are sitting.
Rest up for what's sure to be a heart-stopping last few months of 2020.

343,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 03, 2020 03:45PM ET</span>",Nasdaq Plunge Is Victory Lap for a Stable of Equity Naysayers,"(Bloomberg) -- Whatever else it signifies, and it may not be much, considering what happened the last time stocks did this, Thursday’s plunge in equities was vindication for bearish strategists whose voices had been getting louder.
Skepticism looked smart with technology shares leading the biggest drop since March. Warnings that valuations were out of control and investors would pay for their euphoria have been swirling around for weeks amid a stretch in which the S&P 500 went 30 sessions without a 1% decline. On Thursday, it fell about 4%, while the Nasdaq 100 lost 5.7%.
Bears took a victory lap as high-flying stocks such as  Zoom Video Communications  (NASDAQ:ZM) Inc., Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc. and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). dragged the Nasdaq 100 lower, after the index had rallied in 11 of the past 13 sessions. While the correction was abrupt, it was a overdue given how crowded the megacap tech trade had become, according to  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Investment’s Sameer Samana. And with market attention likely to turn to the upcoming U.S. presidential election after the holiday weekend, traders are likely trimming risk, he said.
“While there was no one trigger, there’s probably some nervousness and squaring up of positions heading into a long weekend,” said Samana, the firm’s senior global market strategist. “Given the nice run, you could even describe it as profit-taking.”
To be sure, that’s all it was on June 11, when the S&P 500 lost 6%. Its return since then is about 15%, even with Thursday’s dramatics.
Tech has powered the S&P 500’s 55% rebound from its March lows. The dynamic kicked into overdrive in recent weeks after Apple and Tesla’s stock splits caused the shares to surge. Prior to Thursday, the Nasdaq’s 41% year-to-date gain exceeded the American equity benchmark’s advance by about 30 percentage points. That’s pushed the relative strength of the Nasdaq over the S&P 500 to the highest on record.
“At some point, you’re bound to see some profit-taking and re-positioning within portfolios,” said Adam Phillips, director of portfolio strategy at EP Wealth Advisors. “It’s hard to know what the final straw was for investors, but the selloff shouldn’t come as much of a surprise. It was quite evident that areas of the market were overextended.”
The warning signs were there. Implied volatility on the Nasdaq 100 has been rising even as the index rallied -- a rare alignment that strategists warned would end painfully, as booming demand for call options forced dealers to recalibrate their hedges. But if that so-called “short-gamma” hedging lifted stocks, logically it should also be capable of exacerbating moves the other way. When shares fall, market makers are likely to unwind hedges at an increasing speed, spurring more losses.
The equity volatility “complex is acting ‘broken’ and indicative that ‘something’s gotta give,’” Charlie McElligott, a cross-asset strategist at Nomura Securities, wrote in a note Thursday. “It all adds up to feel like a recipe for tears, i.e. ‘real’ potential for a Nasdaq/SPX -6% to -8% single day in the next 1m-2m time frame.”
While betting against tech bubble in the 2000s was painful for those who were early, Thursday’s rout is an opportunity to rebalance away from the sector, according to BTIG LLC’s Julian Emanuel. He’s bullish on bank stocks, which are still nursing losses of over 18% in 2020.
“If you have too much technology in your portfolio, now is the time to start taking a little bit of it off with winners, and reallocate to financials,” Emanuel, chief equity and derivatives strategist at BTIG, said on Bloomberg Television and Radio. “We think the Fed has changed the game and financials will ultimately lead the market higher in 2021.”

344,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 03, 2020 03:00PM ET</span>",German prosecutors drop probe into FT over Wirecard,"BERLIN (Reuters) - German prosecutors have dropped their investigation into journalists of the Financial Times in connection with its reporting on the corporate fraud at payments firm Wirecard that eventually led to its collapse.
The Munich public prosecutors office said it has discontinued the proceedings as it has not found enough evidence to support the case.
The prosecutors launched an investigation into a Financial Times journalist in February 2019, prompting the newspaper to reject any allegations against the newspaper or its journalists of market manipulation or unethical reporting.
The FT said in a statement carried in its story of the investigation being dropped: “We welcome this decision. The unfounded criminal complaint should never have been made by (regulator) BaFin and should have been dropped by Munich prosecutors far sooner. Our reporters acted courageously and responsibly in the public interest throughout.”
Wirecard had filed charges against the newspaper on suspicion of market manipulation, accusing them of cooperating with short sellers to help them to profit from share price falls after the reports on the company became public.
The prosecutors said on Thursday that the newspaper's reporting had been fundamentally correct and they had not established direct contact with short sellers. They said the investigation would be continued against the short sellers.
Wirecard's demise has embarrassed Germany's government, which prides itself on a reputation for rectitude and reliability, amid criticism that authorities ignored red flags.
Finance Minister Olaf Scholz, responsible for the financial watchdog, told business newspaper Handelsblatt he was tightening rules on securities transactions for BaFin employees.
Handelsblatt said BaFin employees had increased their trading in Wirecard shares and share derivatives in the months before the firm's collapse.
""Even the mere appearance of conflicts of interest must be avoided,"" Scholz told Handelsblatt, referring to share trading.
""For this reason, the financial supervisory authority will issue additional regulations for employee transactions,"" he added. ""In the ministry, too, we will create stricter rules"".

On Tuesday, German lawmakers launched a parliamentary inquiry into Wirecard's collapse in an effort to force the government to reveal more about a failure to avert the country's biggest post-war corporate fraud.

Investing.com – The Dow fell sharply on Thursday, as a jolt of volatility swept through Wall Street amid a plunge in big tech stocks and mixed economic data.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 2.86%, or 832 points, the S&P 500 was down 3.61%, while the Nasdaq Composite slumped 4.94%.
Tech stocks, which have led the recent market rally, demonstrated their hold over the market once again as a slide in mega-cap tech stalwarts prompted investors to cut their bullish bets on stocks.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) fell nearly 7% to lead the move lower in the Fab 5 stocks, with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) each down more than 4%.
A sharp rise in volatility also rattled investors, with the CBOE Volatility Index, the so-called fear index, surging 25% to a nearly two-month high.
Energy, meanwhile, was the only sector in the green even as oil prices struggled to turn positive as concerns over the strength of demand persist.
Better-than-expected jobs data and softer services growth did little to improve sentiment on the economic recovery a day ahead of the release of August's nonfarm payrolls report.
The ISM non-manufacturing index slowed to a reading of 56.9 last month, from 58.1 in July, missing economists' forecasts for a reading of 57.
""The August ISM Non-Manufacturing report showed a modest decline to 56.9 from 58.1. Technically, this is the lowest level since the index began to improve coming out of the COVID-induced lockdowns in the Spring, but 56.9 is still a very strong outright reading,"" Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) said.
The U.S. Department of Labor reported Thursday that initial jobless claims fell to 881,000 in the week ended Aug. 28, beating forecasts of 950,000.
In other news, Help desk software provider Pagerduty (NYSE:PD) saw its narrower-than-expected quarterly loss overshadowed by softer full-year guidance, sending its shares down 26%."

DETROIT (Reuters) -  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles NV (MI:FCHA) on Thursday unveiled its new family of Jeep Wagoneer and Grand Wagoneer sport utility vehicles, and the head of the Jeep brand told Reuters he wants to match or beat the sales of rival models made by General Motors Co (N:GM).
From a luxury image standpoint, ""we want to beat Range Rover,"" global Jeep brand President Christian Meunier said in an interview. ""From a business standpoint, we want to beat GMC and Cadillac."" 
GM's GMC Yukon and Cadillac Escalade model lines are leading sellers in the North American large, luxury SUV segment. Last year, GMC sold nearly 75,000 Yukons. Cadillac sold 35,424 Escalades, while Ford's Lincoln brand sold 18,656 Navigators in 2019.
Luxury sport utilities built on the underpinnings of big pickup trucks represent one of the most profitable segments in the global auto industry. Wagoneer and Grand Wagoneer prices could range from $60,000 to $100,000, Meunier said. That is comparable to the Escalade and Yukon lineups.
Most such vehicles are sold in North America and in certain Middle Eastern markets. Fiat Chrysler's Jeep brand has not had an entry in this segment for decades. In Jeep's absence, GM's Cadillac Escalade and GMC Yukon and Ford's Expedition and Lincoln Navigator models have dominated the segment in North America. 
Jaguar Land Rover's Range Rover models have defined the premium end of the large luxury SUV market in North America and in other markets.
Vehicles as large as the Grand Wagoneer, which is derived from a Ram pickup truck, are rare in China, the world's largest market. The Wagoneer and Grand Wagoneer will be built in a factory in suburban Detroit - a handicap for selling in China.

However, Meunier said ""there's an opportunity for China which we will test in the next few weeks.""

Investing.com --  Akebia Therapeutics (NASDAQ:AKBA) plummeted 73% to $2.70 after saying its experimental drug failed to meet the main safety goal in a late-stage trial of patients with anemia due to chronic kidney disease and not undergoing dialysis. 
Earlier this year, Akebia had reported positive trial data for the drug in patients with chronic kidney disease on dialysis. The more recent study evaluated the efficacy and safety of Akebia's treatment, vadadustat, versus Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN)'s darbepoetin alfa.
Vadadustat failed to meet the safety goal when compared with time to first occurrence of major adverse cardiovascular events. The drug achieved the main goal and secondary goal on efficacy.  
Needham analyst Chad Messer maintained a buy rating on the company, setting a price target of $10. He expects Akebia Therapeutics to post a loss per share of 47 cents for the third quarter, TipRanks reported.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Major airlines want the U.S. and British governments to launch a passenger testing trial for the coronavirus for flights between London and New York to pave the way for a resumption of more international travel.
In a letter to government transportation officials seen by Reuters, the chief executives of Airlines for America, Airlines UK, Heathrow Airport and Virgin Atlantic Airways said both governments should ""establish passenger testing solutions in air travel.
""We believe that in the immediate absence of a vaccine, testing of passengers in aviation provides the best and most effective frontline defense.""
They urged the governments to establish a testing trial between New York and London by month's end ""to gather real world evidence and data."" 
Sharon Pinkerton, senior vice president at Airlines for America, which represents American Airlines Co (O:AAL), Delta Air Lines (N:DAL), United Airlines (O:UAL) and others, told reporters on Thursday the industry wanted a pilot program to help boost international travel.
U.S. international travel has fallen by 87% during the coronavirus pandemic, which has battered the airline industry.
""One of the key steps to recovery is setting up an international pilot program between the U.S. and either Europe, Canada, somewhere in the Pacific,"" she said, saying that could help eliminate some of the international quarantines now in place.
The U.S. Transportation Department said it ""stands ready to support the safe resumption of international flights between the U.S. and Europe. Conversations are ongoing between the federal government, international partners, and industry stakeholders on these matters.""
A UK government representative declined to comment on the proposal.
In March, U.S. President Donald Trump barred most non-U.S. citizens who had been in the UK recently from entering the United States - restrictions also imposed on travelers in the European Union and China.

Americans can travel to the UK but have been required since spring to spend two weeks in quarantine on arrival.

(Reuters) -  Campbell Soup  Co (N:CPB) on Thursday forecast first-quarter revenue largely above market estimates due to pandemic-buying, but said it expects sales to drop off in the second-half of its fiscal year as people start dining out again, sending shares down 5.5%. 
The packaged food industry has seen an unprecedented wave of demand since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, with people on lockdown stocking their pantries and eating more at home. At Campbell, for instance, fourth-quarter U.S. soup sales rose 52%, despite having struggled to grow for several years.
[For a graphic, click here: https://graphics.reuters.com/CAMPBELLSOUP-RESULTS/yzdvxxjbyvx]
But it is unlikely the company will be able to sustain the sales growth it has seen since the start of March for its Prego pasta sauces and Goldfish crackers. 
New Jersey-based Campbell expects lower fiscal second-half sales, but said demand will not entirely revert back to pre-COVID levels because the pandemic has put its cookies, potato chips and sauces in the pantries of households that did not previously buy them. 
Given how many food companies are reporting very strong numbers with extremely positive tones, Campbell's commentary was slightly shy of expectations this morning, J.P. Morgan analyst Ken Goldman said.
Elevated demand has put pressure on Campbell's inventory levels, expenses and supply chain this year. Campbell said it spent $50 million on fourth-quarter COVID-related costs, and that it expects expenses to continue in the first half of this fiscal year at a ""moderated level compared to the fourth quarter."" 
Bernstein analyst Alexia Howard said she questions whether Campbell will be able to retain its new customers in a post-COVID world - particularly those currently buying packaged soup - due to longstanding concerns about tinned food and sodium content.
Campbell forecast current-quarter net sales to rise between 5% and 7%, and adjusted profit to be between 88 cents and 92 cents per share. Analysts on average expected Campbell to earn 90 cents per share and its net sales to rise 5.2%, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Campbell said net sales rose to $2.11 billion in the fourth quarter, ended Aug. 2, from $1.78 billion, a year earlier, beating expectations of $2.08 billion.

Market analysts and traders called it a near-term profit-taking, triggered by the company's plan to raise $5 billion from the market and the stake sale by the second largest shareholder Baillie Gifford, in a stock that has surged fivefold in 2020.
They expect it to be short-lived. ""It's just a poster child for the growth trade and there's a bit of general rotation,"" a London-based trader told Reuters.
Meanwhile, Edinburgh-based Baillie Gifford told Herald Scotland the investment firm remains a ""strong supporter"" of Tesla, but had to sell its passive stake due to norms that limit the weight of a stock in clients' portfolios.
Gifford cut its stake to 4.25% compared to 7.67% as of Dec. 31, making it now the fourth largest stakeholder, according to Refinitiv data. 
""I know Baillie Gifford were a kind of forced seller to stay within the mandates, but (an) evidence of core investor profit-taking as the company start a sell off of $5 billion stock,"" the trader said.
Ever since Tesla surprised Wall Street by delivering on Chief Executive Elon Musk's promise of a profit in its third quarter in October last year, its shares have risen nearly nine-fold. 
The world's most valuable carmaker has gone on to register three more profitable quarters, clearing a hurdle that could lead to its inclusion in the benchmark S&P 500 index.
The index rebalances every quarter, but a stock can be added to the index at any point once a company becomes eligible for consideration. 
Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices, declined to comment on potential index membership changes.
The surge in shares during the COVID-19 pandemic have also led Tesla and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) to split their richly priced stock.

The iPhone maker's shares, which have jumped more than 35% since it announced its split, fell for the second session, down 5.2%, while Tesla shares were down 6.5% in early trading on Thursday.

357,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 03, 2020 12:15PM ET</span>","GM, Honda to jointly develop vehicles in North America, expanding consolidation","By Ben Klayman and Sanjana Shivdas
(Reuters) - General Motors (N:GM) and Honda Motor Co (T:7267) on Thursday revealed plans to team up in North America to make a range of vehicles, deepening their ties as the auto industry comes under greater pressure to share technology and costs to meet demands for cleaner vehicles.
Under the alliance, Honda and GM said, the companies intend to share common vehicle platforms, including electrified and internal combustion propulsion systems.
The companies still need to complete a definitive agreement and officials said greater details on expected cost savings would be available then, but a person familiar with the matter said the savings would run in the billions of dollars for each company.
The partnership represents a significant expansion of existing collaborations between the two companies on electric and autonomous vehicles, connected vehicle technology and fuel cells. Honda is an investor in Cruise, the self-driving business that GM majority owns.
""Overall, we believe this alliance would help both companies realize significant cost savings in the development of our vehicle portfolios,"" GM President Mark Reuss said in a statement.
The deal marks another milestone in the consolidation of the global auto industry, as pressures to cut emissions and move toward EVs strain the capital and engineering resources of even the largest players.
Former  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) (MI:FCHA) Chief Executive Sergio Marchionne had for years pushed for consolidation in the global auto industry, arguing it was inevitable to manage prohibitive capital costs.
FCA announced a $50 billion merger with France's PSA (PA:PEUP) last year to create the world's fourth largest carmaker, Stellantis, in a move to address cost and scale issues. That deal is expected to close by the end of the first quarter of 2021.
Japan's Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203) has been expanding ties with smaller Japanese automakers such as Mazda Motor Corp (T:7261) and Subaru (T:9778).  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) and German automaker Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p) have forged a wide-ranging alliance covering electric and commercial vehicles and autonomous driving technology. 
Analysts and GM investors have been pushing for a transformational change at the Detroit automaker, with repeated questions around the spinoff of its EV operations into a separate company. GM CEO Mary Barra has said such an option was not off the table.
GM and Honda said in April they would jointly develop two new EVs for Honda and were planning to explore more ways to expand their alliance. They have already worked together on the design of an autonomous vehicle called Cruise Origin, and also collaborated on fuel cells and batteries.
Honda has for years remained largely independent, staying clear of industry mergers. But the GM alliance will give it economies of scale it cannot achieve on its own, Honda Executive Vice President Seji Kuraishi said. North America is Honda's largest market and GM's second largest behind China.
GM and Honda said joint development discussions will begin immediately, with engineering work starting in early 2021. 
The companies plan to explore vehicle platform-sharing possibilities in more than four core segments including crossovers and midsized pickup trucks, along with propulsion systems, infotainment and connectivity services, advanced driver-assist features, vehicle connectivity and other technology. They also will cooperate on purchasing.

 Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) analyst Dan Levy said in a research note that it was ""encouraging"" to see the companies teaming up on gasoline-powered engines as that technology still requires investment even as the industry shifts to EVs.

358,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 03, 2020 11:35AM ET</span>",VW-backed battery maker QuantumScape to go public at $3.3 billion valuation,"By Paul Lienert
(Reuters) - QuantumScape, the 10-year-old Silicon Valley battery startup backed by Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p), said on Thursday it plans to go public through a reverse merger with  Kensington Capital Acquisition  Corp (N:KCAC) with an enterprise value of $3.3 billion.
San Jose-based QuantumScape, a 2010 spinout from Stanford University, said it will form a joint venture with VW to produce solid-state battery cells, starting in 2024, for the German automaker's electric vehicles, and eventually for other carmakers.
""Our ambition is to be a (battery) supplier to the industry as a whole,"" QuantumScape founder and CEO Jagdeep Singh said in an interview.
QuantumScape is the latest transportation startup to tie up with a special-purpose acquisition company, or SPAC. Among the recent SPAC-backed transactions: Lidar maker Luminar, electric truck maker Nikola, electric shuttle maker Canoo and electric car maker Fisker.
A SPAC is a shell company that raises money through an IPO to buy a private operating company, typically within two years.
Shares of the Kensington SPAC were up 58.4% at $15.84 in late morning on Thursday.
VW has committed more than $300 million to QuantumScape. Other corporate investors include Shanghai Auto (SS:600104), which is partnered with VW in China, and German auto supplier  Continental AG  (DE:CONG).
Venture backers include Bill Gates, Khosla Ventures and Kleiner Perkins. The Qatar Investment Authority also participated in the latest funding round.
Ahead of the merger announcement, QuantumScape raised $500 million from institutional investors, led by Fidelity Management & Research.
The SPAC deal is expected to close in late 2020, when the new company will trade on the NYSE under the ticker symbol QS.
Singh said QuantumScape's lithium-metal battery uses a solid ceramic electrolyte which he said is safer than a conventional liquid electrolyte. It also eliminates the need for an anode, allowing the battery to charge more quickly - up to 80% capacity in just 15 minutes. Also, its energy density is much higher, exceeding 400 watt-hours per kilogram, which far surpasses 250 Wh/kg for the best current lithium-ion batteries.
""The company has an opportunity to redefine the battery landscape,"" said J.B. Straubel, a member of QuantumScape's board who is CEO of battery recycling startup Redwood (NYSE:RWT) Materials and a co-founder of Tesla Inc (O:TSLA). 

Kensington is a SPAC headed by investment banker Justin Mirro, a specialist in transportation-related deals who will join QuantumScape's board. Kensington's directors include Tom LaSorda, former vice chairman of Chrysler; Don Runkle, former vice chairman of Delphi, and Matt Simoncini, former CEO of  Lear  (NYSE:LEA) Corp.

Musk made the comments to bystanders at Gruenheide, on the outskirts of Berlin, where the U.S. carmaker is building its new European factory, a video on the Teslarati website showed. 
Tesla plans to manufacture a new version of its Model Y crossover vehicle, and possibly even battery cells at the site.
""It will be the first time that there will be a transformation in the core structural design of the vehicle. It's quite a big thing. Both manufacturing, engineering and design as well,"" Musk said in the video. 
Tesla wanted to help accelerate a transition to sustainable energy, not just build cars, Musk said.
""The three elements needed for a sustainable energy future are sustainable energy generation, energy storage, and sustainable transport, electric cars."" 
Musk's comments come after Tesla acquired a licence that will enable it to trade electricity across western Europe and started surveying customers in Germany about potentially using Tesla electricity in their cars.
""I think we will be building some batteries and cells and other things here. That will be good for stationary storage of wind and solar,"" Musk stated. 
Musk, who said he was pleased with the progress being made on the plant, told the bystanders that ""Deutschland Rocks"" and praised the availability of local engineering talent, saying that Tesla would need to make lots of hires. 
""We will start off with the factory but we will also do some original engineering and design work. It is going to be, actually to be totally frank, better than the one in the U.S.""
As well as having the most advanced vehicle paintshops in the world at its Brandenburg factory, Tesla wants to have a colour laboratory in Germany.
Musk, while signing autographs for fans, said he also has plans for a ""ravecave"" on the roof of the new factory, which would be a ""real fun place to work"".

""I think a ravecave is culturally necessary.""

PVH reported earnings per share of 13 cents compared to the estimated loss per share of $2.52, while Five Below published earnings per share of 50 cents compared to the expected 14 cents. 
Five Below shares bounced 7.4%, PVH rose 5.5%, and Macy's (NYSE:M) popped 11%, while Coty (NYSE:COTY) was up 5.5%.
Both Five Below and PVH said the current quarter is showing potential.
“The third quarter is off to a strong start and we are focused on the all-important holiday season,"" said Five Below Chief Executive Officer Joel Anderson in a statement.
PVH Chief Executive Officer Emmanuel Chirico noted the trend toward lounge-friendly clothing, and the return of the all important Chinese market.
""We continue to see outperformance in our digital businesses and across our comfort and casual assortments. As we head into the third quarter, trends in China and Europe continue to be very encouraging,"" Chirico said in an earnings statement. 
Macy's on Wednesday reported profit and sales that beat expectations, with upscale brand Bloomingdale's sparkling the brightest. 
""From textile to shoes, to handbags, to mattresses, to diamonds, luxury proved to be strong across almost every category of the Bloomingdale's business, significantly growing its penetration of the business year-over-year. Given our strength in this area, we are leaning harder into luxury in order to capitalize on the shift in spending,"" said Felicia Williams (NYSE:WMB), interim chief financial officer at Macy's, in an earnings call yesterday.

LONDON (Reuters) - Financial regulators must avoid playing catch up with digital payment methods like stablecoins and crypto-assets, Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey said on Thursday.
Stablecoins are still a relatively niche corner of the cryptocurrency world that barely featured on policymakers' agendas until Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) unveiled its Libra stablecoins last year.
Central banks and financial regulators feared Libra -- planned as a stablecoin backed by a wide mixture of currencies and government debt -- could destabilise monetary policy and facilitate money laundering, with some threatening to block it.
""If stablecoins are to be widely used as a means of payment, they must have equivalent standards to those that are in place today for other forms of payment types and the forms of money transferred through them,"" Bailey said in a speech to the Brookings Institution.
Existing regulatory standards must be examined and updated where necessary in light of stablecoins, he said, calling for a clear G20 mandate for standard-setting bodies to refresh or clarify standards.
Any stablecoin based on the pound that was launched in Britain should meet standards similar to those applied to banks, Bailey said. The issuer of such a coin would need to be based in Britain, he added.
""If a sterling retail stablecoin wishes to operate at scale in the UK, then we will strongly consider the need for an entity to be incorporated in the UK.""
Such a requirement may impact plans for Libra. 

In April, the Geneva-based Libra Association, which will issue and govern the planned stablecoin, said it would offer stablecoins based on a still-undecided line-up of individual currencies, citing those based on the dollar, euro and sterling as possible examples.

In the first half of this year, commercial jet deliveries plunged 75% compared with the same period a year earlier, Embraer said in a statement. The company noted that the pandemic hit its commercial aviation division particularly hard.
Separately, newspaper Folha de S. Paulo reported that public prosecutors are to investigate Embraer for allegedly coercing staff to accept voluntary redundancy.
The metalworkers union in Sao Jose dos Campos, where Embraer is based, said in a statement that employees accuse Embraer of coercing them to join the program, whose deadline was Tuesday. 
The union said it had not been involved in negotiating the layoffs, which it equated to firings. It said the company's financial problems stem from its failed merger with Boeing and not the pandemic.
Embraer said in its statement that since the onset of the pandemic it has launched three voluntary redundancy programs, accepted by around 1,600 employees. Embraer also said it has taken other measures to preserve jobs such as collective vacations, reduced working hours and paid leave.
""The objective is to ensure the company's sustainability and engineering capacity,"" the company said.

363,By Investing.com,"<span>Sep 03, 2020 11:03AM ET</span>",Wall Street Lower as Profit-Taking Hits Tech; Dow Falls 358 Pts,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened mostly lower on Thursday, and all three indexes turned red as the aggressive buying of options in tech stocks by retail traders over recent weeks continued to unwind. 
By 11:00 AM (1500 GMT), the Nasdaq Composite, which has marched from one record high to another in recent weeks, was down 3.5%, while the S&P 500, which also closed at a new record high on Wednesday, fell 2%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which has less exposure to tech than the other two big boards, fell 358 points, or 1.2%.
The market showed little reaction to a mixed set of data from the labor market ahead of Friday's official government payrolls number. The Challenger job cuts survey appeared to show a sharp drop in layoffs in August to 115,800 from over 262,000 in July. Initial and continuing jobless claims also posted their sharpest weekly drops in months. However, there was a surge in those requesting Pandemic Unemployment Assistance, meaning that there were still 29 million Americans claiming all forms of unemployment-related benefits as of the middle of August. 
The Institute of Supply Management's non-manufacturing purchasing managers' index fell by more than expected to 56.9, though still a level that implies robust growth.
The losses were led by some of the names that have made the biggest gains in recent weeks. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock fell 8.9% while Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock fell 4.9%. While Tesla was still arguably dealing with the overhang of stock placed earlier in the week by U.K.-based Baillie Gifford, one of its biggest institutional investors, there was no obvious news flow behind Apple's movement. 
Other stocks to fall sharply in the morning included Zoom Video (NASDAQ:ZM), which lost 9.9% in an extended pullback, after rocketing by over 20% in response to strong quarterly numbers earlier in the week. Peloton Interactive (NASDAQ:PTON) stock also fell 9.8%. 
Analysts at Saxo Bank noted that the extraordinary moves of some hot tech stocks in recent weeks had been caused by brokers buying the stock to hedge exposures taken by selling call options to retail traders well above current market levels (so-called 'out of the money' calls). 
""These options dynamics are causing massive intraday volatility in certain stocks, so we recommend traders and investors to prepare for large sudden intraday moves,"" Saxo wrote in a note to clients Thursday. ""Tesla Sep 18 call options with strike at $450 (just above yesterday’s close) are trading at implied volatility of 120% indicating the huge uncertainty in Tesla’s share price. This means that investors buying call options really need big moves to the upside to get the calls in the money. At some point many investors buying these calls will learn it the hard way that these implied volatility levels are extremely elevated and expensive.""
For now, though, the army of retail traders that has driven much of this year's rally seems undaunted. Open interest in the futures contract mentioned by Saxo actually increased on Wednesday, meaning that traders raised their exposure.

The latest apps include Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) Ltd's (HK:0700) popular videogame PUBG. India imported $65.3 billion worth of goods from China in the fiscal year ended March 2020, and exported $16.6 billion, according to the country's Commerce ministry. Below are trade arrangements and financial deals in major industries and products between the two countries:
** PharmaceuticalIndia sources around 70% of its active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) from China to supply its vast pharmaceutical industry that includes Sun Pharmaceutical Industries (NS:SUN),  Lupin  (NS:LUPN) and IPCA Labs (NS:IPCA).
India's pharma imports from China were $2.68 billion in 2019-20.
** Automotive
India's auto parts imports from China were $4.2 billion in 2019, including engine and transmission parts, according to data from the Auto Component Manufacturers' Association of India (ACMA).
New Delhi has asked auto companies to cut imports from China, but industry experts say India relies heavily on China for cheap auto parts and electronic components. 
Maharashtra, home to financial capital Mumbai, in June stalled a proposal by China's Great Wall Motor (SS:601633) to invest nearly $500 million.
Great Wall Motor and SAIC (SS:600104) unit MG Motor have bet big on India with investment proposals.
** Investment & Finance
In April, India tightened rules for investments from neighbouring countries, including China, to prevent opportunistic takeovers after the COVID-19 pandemic.
Chinese firms' existing and planned investments in India stand at more than $26 billion, research group Brookings said in March.
Chinese tech gaints Tencent and  Alibaba  (N:BABA) have fuelled growth of Indian digital payments firms Paytm, grocer BigBasket and ride-hailing giant Ola.
** Metals
India's steel exports more than doubled between April and July to hit their highest level in at least six years, boosted by a surge of Chinese buying.
India's exports of iron and steel and related articles to China stood at $595.9 million, while Indian imports from China in 2019-2020 stood at $2.71 billion.
India in June imposed an anti-dumping duty on flat-rolled steel products that are plated or coated with alloy of aluminium and zinc originating in, or from countries including China.
** Non Essential Items:The Indian government has been consulting with companies on tightening curbs on 1,173 non-essential products including toys, plastics, steel items, electronics and specific auto components, according to a trade body official.
India has also been planning to impose higher trade barriers and raise import duties on around 300 products from China and elsewhere.

The Bloomberg Consumer Comfort Index advanced 0.8 point to 45.1 for the week ended Aug. 30, according to data released Thursday. The measure is up almost 10 points in the last three weeks among those making $100,000 or more, while it’s declined among those earning less than $50,000, highlighting a growing divergence in sentiment based on income.
A gauge of comfort in personal finances climbed to a six-week high, while a measure of the buying climate also reached its highest since early April. Views of the economy improved as well.
The latest data underscore the differing realities of low- and high-income workers during the pandemic-driven downturn. The S&P 500 Index topped its previous all-time high two weeks ago and has continued to climb in the days since, padding the savings of more-affluent Americans. Meanwhile, job losses have disproportionately impacted low-wage earners, and many of those individuals don’t have money invested in equities.
The economy is slowly coming back, but it has a long way to go. Less than half of the jobs lost in March and April have been recouped, and millions continue to rely on unemployment benefit payments. America’s food banks are overwhelmed by a surge in demand. Businesses are reopening, but companies continue to announce layoffs months into the pandemic, likely weighing on sentiment.
The data contrasts with the Conference Board’s monthly confidence measure published last week. The index fell in August to the lowest since 2014 as gauges of current conditions and expectations deteriorated. The University of Michigan’s confidence index did rise in August but came in below the reading two months earlier.

367,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 03, 2020 10:27AM ET</span>",Tesla’s 3-Day Correction Approaches Bear Market as Rally Pauses,"(Bloomberg) -- Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc. shares are now officially in correction territory, in a week that saw the electric-vehicle maker announce a share sale that could dilute its value and a top holder say it would cut its stake nearly in half.
Shares of the company fell as much as 9.5% on Thursday, bringing the loss since Monday’s close to about 19%, the steepest 3-day drop since mid-March. The decline came amid a broader slump in high-flying tech stocks that pushed the Nasdaq 100 to its worst one-day loss in six weeks.
The Elon Musk-led company has been a standout performer in the U.S. stock market this year, soaring nearly 500% through Monday. The gain was helped by strong second-quarter results that also fueled speculation about Tesla becoming a part of the S&P 500 Index. Its much-hyped “Battery Day” event, to be held later this month, may also have boosted optimism since many expect the company to unveil new technologies that day.
All of these developments, along with Musk’s cult-like following, have made Tesla a darling of retail investors, with it occupying almost a permanent place in online brokerage Robinhood’s list of most popular stocks.
Though it is hard to pinpoint the reason for this week’s pause to Tesla’s previously unstoppable rally, some say it is the law of gravity catching up, possibly aided by news of the company’s largest shareholder after Musk cutting its stake, as well as the market slowly digesting Tesla’s plan to sell as much as $5 billion in shares. The share sale was announced on Tuesday, and it could be the largest equity haul ever for the company if it sells at least $2.34 billion under the plan.
Whatever the trigger, the stock at 9:50 AM ET was down about 15% from the closing peak of $498.32 that it touched on Aug. 31. A stock is considered to be correcting when it falls more than 10% from the latest high, while a 20% plunge would put it in a bear market.

Jesper Berg, the director general of the Financial Supervisory Authority in Denmark, said the bank’s failure to tell the truth would constitute “one of the big sins,” in an interview with Bloomberg on Thursday.
“We don’t know whether that’s the case here,” he said. “But that’s a big issue.”
Berg said that “the steps which can be taken include police investigations and possible prison sentences,” if it emerges that Danske failed to provide accurate and truthful information to the FSA.
The watchdog this week launched an investigation into Danske, and is in talks with the police, after it emerged that about 15,000 customers were overcharged for years on end due to errors in the bank’s debt collection system. Danske had assured the FSA last year that it was working to rectify the issue and reimburse those affected. But the errors continued, and the bank is now reviewing over 100,000 accounts.
Danske is already being investigated separately in the U.S. and Europe for a money laundering scandal, after it admitted that much of $230 billion in non-resident flows via an Estonian unit was suspicious.
Though the amounts in the debt collection affair are considerably smaller, with Danske estimating its customers may have paid about $8 million too much in total, the case represents yet another blow to its reputation. The government was swift to voice its condemnation, and is now looking into the matter with parliament.

Danske spokesman Stefan Singh Kailay said in emailed comments on Wednesday that the bank has been “in dialogue” with the FSA since June 2019, keeping it updated on internal investigations and remediation plans relating to the debt collection case.
“We will continue to do so,” Kailay said. “Our main priority is to make sure we continue to correct the mistakes we have made by going through all these cases and reimbursing all affected customers.”
The FSA has given Danske until Sept. 10 to answer a number of questions relating to the debt collection case, including when it first discovered there was a problem.

OSLO (Reuters) - Norway's $1.2 trillion wealth fund will ask the companies in its portfolio that emit the most carbon dioxide (CO2) for more detailed climate-related data in order to understand the risk posed to its investments, a top official said.
The world's largest sovereign fund, which invests Norway's oil revenues, has for the past two decades been at the forefront of efforts to get firms to makes disclosures about the impact of their business on the environment.
""What we want to see is whether they have a business model that can survive also in a low-carbon society and to understand how will they address that,"" Carine Smith Ihenacho, the fund's Chief Corporate Governance Officer, told Reuters.
""We want scenario analysis, including a two-degree scenario analysis, and we want the company to be open about the assumptions for the analysis,"" she said, without naming the companies the fund was contacting.
The 2015 Paris Agreement calls on nations worldwide to limit global warming this century to well below two degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. 
Norway's fund is invested in 9,200 companies, or 1.5% of the world's stocks. It listed its own carbon footprint at 107.6 millions of tonnes of CO2 equivalent in 2019, which is double Norway's and had risen from 107.4 millions in 2018.
The fund has recently changed CEO, appointing hedge fund veteran Nicolai Tangen, who started this week.
LOBBYING ON AGENDA
How companies lobby on climate change has risen higher up the agenda of investors from a decade ago, as they seek to understand the interaction with policymakers.
Last month, Norway's Storebrand Asset Management began divesting from firms, citing their climate lobbying practices.
During the latest annual general meeting (AGM) season, the Norwegian wealth fund voted in favour of all motions on the topic put forward at AGMs of firms it is invested in. 
Although only five motions called for more transparency on a company's climate lobbying, Smith Ihenacho said she expected more such demands during the next AGM season.
""This is very much on shareholders' agenda,"" she said, citing in particular the need to know about companies' membership of associations.
""We want to know where the discrepancies are between a company's policy association and a trade association they may support financially,"" she said. 

The wealth fund is unlikely to follow Storebrand's lead, however, as it prefers engagement with firms in which it invests, Smith Ihenacho said.

Though the layoffs reported by global outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas on Thursday were 56% down from July, they lifted total job cuts so far this year to a record 1.963 million. The previous all-time annual high was 1.957 million in 2001. Companies announced 160,411 hiring intentions in August.
""The leading sector for job cuts last month was transportation, as airlines begin to make staffing decisions in the wake of decreased travel and uncertain federal intervention,"" said Andrew Challenger, senior vice president at Challenger, Gray. ""An increasing number of companies that initially had temporary job cuts or furloughs are now
making them permanent.""
The report followed news on Wednesday that private employers hired fewer workers than expected in August. The weak data raises the risk of a sharper slowdown in job growth in August.
The Labor Department will publish its closely watched, and broader, monthly employment report on Friday. According to a Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls likely increased by 1.4 million jobs in August, down from 1.763 million in July.
Government assistance to workers and employers led to a sharp rebound in economic activity, but its expiration in recent weeks has left the recovery from the depths of the coronavirus crisis floundering.
United Airlines (O:UAL) said on Wednesday it was preparing to furlough 16,370 workers on Oct. 1. Airlines received $25 billion in government stimulus funds in March meant to cover payrolls and protect jobs through September.
According to Challenger, Gray & Christmas, transportation companies announced 26,545 job cuts in August, bringing the tally this year to 131,571 jobs, a 482% increase compared to the January-August period in 2019. 
Another 17,271 layoffs were announced at bars, restaurants, hotels and amusement parks in August. Entertainment and leisure companies have announced 799,051 job cuts this year. 

Employers continued to blame poor market conditions, weak demand and cost-cutting for layoffs in August.

374,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 03, 2020 07:50AM ET</span>",U.S. airlines isolated in bid to scrap change fees forever,"By Tracy Rucinski and Laurence Frost
CHICAGO/PARIS (Reuters) - A radical bid to revive air travel demand by permanently sacrificing billions of dollars in fees to change tickets has left U.S. airlines isolated, as foreign rivals fear the tactic would undermine the higher fares paid by premium travellers.
The COVID-19 crisis has weakened one of the core elements of the airline playbook: price many fares attractively low, then charge for ticket changes. And meanwhile charge a hefty premium to those wanting more flexibility: typically business passengers.
""For the fee model to work, you have to have a passenger to nickel-and-dime,"" said John Zhang, professor of marketing at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School. Airlines may soon ""walk back other fees as well,"" he added.
Citi data shows U.S. carriers last year earned $2.8 billion or 1.1% of revenue from cancellations and change fees.
American Airlines (O:AAL), Delta Air Lines (N:DAL) and United Airlines (O:UAL) have all permanently axed the charges on domestic travel in recent days, followed by Alaska Airlines.
""It's a revenue loss, but the bet is that this is going to win over customers,"" said ICF consultant Carlos Ozores.
The move comes as U.S. and European passenger traffic remains more than 80% below 2019 levels, July data from global industry body IATA shows, with Asia-Pacific down 72%.
While airlines globally have suspended change fees during the pandemic, those outside the U.S. are resisting making the concessions permanent.
Lufthansa (DE:LHAG) has announced a waiver until year-end, while Air France-KLM (PA:AIR) has set no date for a resumption of fees and says it is unlikely to make them permanent.
Low-cost carriers EasyJet (L:EZJ) and Ryanair (I:RYA) also said there were no plans for lasting fee changes.
Analysts say restoring fees could prove near-impossible through the weak northern-hemisphere winter - and will only get tougher as consumers increasingly take new terms for granted.
But much could depend on an expected wave of industry consolidation, reducing competition in some markets as weaker airlines shrink or fold, Citi analyst Mark Manduca said.
""Once that happens we'll be in a better place to assess the bargaining power between airline and customer,"" he said, adding that surviving airlines that emerge fewer and stronger may swiftly end any ""free-lunch mentality"".
Australia's Qantas Airways Ltd (AX:QAN) dismissed suggestions that temporary concessions could stay.
Axing fees would undermine the value to a corporate customer of paying more upfront for flexibility, Qantas Chief Executive Alan Joyce told the CAPA Australia Pacific Aviation Summit.
""If every airfare is going to be flexible, your revenue management system I think fundamentally breaks down,"" Joyce said, backed by Qatar Airways counterpart Akbar al-Baker.
Some observers also question the eye-catching permanency of the U.S. fee waivers, predicting that airlines will find a way to bring them back.

""It's almost impossible they won't do that once demand is higher, only it might be a 'transfer' fee instead of a 'change' fee,"" said Zhang. ""This isn't a forever kind of thing.""

BERLIN (Reuters) - Silicon Valley entrepreneur Elon Musk praised German vaccine developer CureVac (O:CVAC) as one the world's most innovative firms in a conversation with German Economy Minister Peter Altmaier, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters on Thursday.
""Musk and Altmaier agreed that CureVac, which is working on a new vaccine approach and which collaborates with Tesla, counts among the most innovative companies in the world,"" the source said, referring to a meeting on Wednesday.
Musk, who is Tesla Inc's (O:TSLA) CEO, met with three German ministers and other senior politicians on Wednesday to discuss the progress of a collaboration between the carmaker and CureVac and a planned electric vehicle factory near Berlin. 
The economy ministry declined to comment. Europe-based spokespeople for Tesla were not immediately available for comment.
Investor Dietmar Hopp, who owns short of 50% in CureVac, on Thursday dismissed as ""pure fantasy"" any speculation that Musk's appreciation for the biotech company amounted to takeover interest, speaking to news website Merkur.de.
A CureVac spokesman said purchasing a stake in CureVac was not a topic of discussions during Musk's visit of the company's Tuebingen headquarters on Tuesday.
A Tesla subsidiary is helping to build mobile molecule printers to make the potential COVID-19 vaccine under development by CureVac.

Last November, the U.S. electric carmaker announced plans to build a electric vehicle factory in Gruenheide in the eastern state of Brandenburg that surrounds Berlin.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are set to open a touch lower Thursday, consolidating after record closing levels during the previous session, ahead of the release of key economic data.
At 07:00 AM ET (1100 GMT), S&P 500 futures traded 14 points, or 0.4%, lower, the Dow futures contract fell 38 points, or 0.1%, with Nasdaq 100 futures dropping 125 points, or 1%. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed Wednesday 1.6%, or 453 points, higher at 29,099, its highest level and first time above 29,000 since Feb. 20. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite rose 1.6% and 1% respectively to close at record highs.
Confirmation that the Federal Reserve is set to maintain an easy-money policy for the foreseeable future has helped power the stock market forward, while reports of new talks over the stalled stimulus bill have fanned expectations of a deal.
That said, the window for a deal to be reached in Congress is tightening as the presidential election draws nearer. 
""With the US election under just over [two] months away this could well be the last legislative battle before ballots are cast,"" Deutsche Bank's Jim Reid said, in a note to clients Wednesday. ""A lack of stimulus could result in softer data in the upcoming months.""
There are some important economic data releases later Thursday, including the weekly release of initial and continuing jobless claims. These have been running at elevated levels, pointing to a sustained high level of lay-offs even as the economy rebounds.
This follows Wednesday’s data showing the U.S. economy created 428,000 private jobs last month, well short of estimates of 950,000, and ahead of Friday’s monthly official employment report.
In addition, Thursday marks the release of the latest  ISM non-manufacturing index, a measure of business activity in hard-hit sectors of the service economy.
In corporate news, DocuSign (NASDAQ:DOCU) is set to report earnings Thursday, and is expected to benefit from the stay-at-home orders that forced businesses to move online. Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) also reports, and is likely to have benefited from a trend toward cloud computing and the anticipation of 5G network technology.
Oil prices weakened Thursday, continuing Wednesday’s sharp losses amid concerns about the demand for fuel given a patchy U.S. economic recovery..
U.S. crude futures traded 1.8% lower at $40.77 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract fell 1.7% to $43.69. Both benchmark contracts saw falls of more than 2% on Wednesday, with WTI sliding to its lowest close in nearly four weeks and Brent at its lowest since Aug. 21.

This week, BTS scored Korea's first-ever no. 1 spot on the main U.S. Billboard music chart with breezy disco hit ""Dynamite"". Their first all-English language single hit the spot for mainstream U.S. pop fans, with a Youtube video garnering more than 284 million views already.
Big Hit CEO and largest shareholder Bang Si-hyuk last month gave 478,695 common shares to the seven BTS members, or 68,385 per each, ""to strengthen long-term partnership with major artists and boost morale"", Big Hit said in a regulatory filing on Wednesday. 
Each BTS member would get 9.23 billion won of shares, or 64.6 billion won altogether, if the IPO is priced at the top of its range in October.
The stock gift may be interpreted as an attempt to bind the BTS members and the label more closely together, said Kim Hyun-yong, analyst at eBEST Investment & Securities. 
Big Hit plans to offer about 7.1 million shares at an indicative price range of 105,000-135,000 won per share. 
The pricing potentially values the company at up to 4.8 trillion won ($4.04 billion), considering convertible preferred stocks plus common shares, analysts said. 
""The stock could perform well upon listing, as there's a lot of liquidity in the market now... Then it depends on Big Hit's results, but the lack of physical concerts due to COVID-19 will likely have negative impact,"" said Nam Hyo-ji, analyst at KTB Investment and Securities. 
Big Hit relies heavily on BTS, with some 87.7% and 97.4% of its revenue in the first half of 2020 and 2019 respectively coming from the group, the filing said. 
With BTS members expected to enter mandatory military service for South Korean men in coming years, the label has worked to address market concerns that it needs to diversify its revenue streams.
""There is the military issue, but if there is no legal exemption, Big Hit is expected to either set up units with the remaining members or pursue solo acts while they serve in the military,"" said Kim Hyun-yong.

Last month the number of people in work in Britain suffered the biggest drop since 2009 and the coronavirus is expected to take a much heavier toll on unemployment when the government winds down its huge job-protection scheme.
The one bright spot however has come from online retail and logistics as orders surged during lockdown. Amazon's latest recruitment will take its total UK workforce to over 40,000 by the end of the year.
The U.S. internet giant said the 7,000 new roles will be for warehouse workers, as well as engineers, HR and IT professionals and health and safety and finance specialists.
The jobs will be in over 50 sites, including two new distribution centres in the north east and central England and at corporate offices.
It said it needed more staff to meet growing customer demand for its services and to enable small and medium sized enterprises selling on Amazon to scale their businesses.
Amazon has also started recruiting for more than 20,000 seasonal positions across the UK for the festive period.
Last month the Confederation of British Industry said British retailers had cut the most jobs since the depths of the financial crisis and expected the pace of losses to accelerate. 
Well-known British retailers Marks & Spencer (L:MKS), John Lewis, Debenhams , WH Smith (L:SMWH) and Dixons Carphone (L:DC) have all announced job cuts in recent weeks, reflecting the rapid shift in demand to online sales.

381,By Investing.com,"<span>Sep 03, 2020 05:31AM ET</span>",StockBeat: Macron's Stimulus Plan Backs the CAC 40,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- French President Emmanuel Macron has taken advantage of the Covid-19 pandemic to push through the business-friendly reforms he couldn’t manage in his first three years in office.
And it’s showing.
Despite being widely flagged for weeks, the 100 billion euro ($118 billion) stimulus package formally announced by the government on Thursday morning has breathed life into the French stock market, pushing the CAC 40 up by 1.8%.
What’s impressing investors is the fact that over one-third of the package – some 35 billion euros – is aimed at improving the structural competitiveness of French companies, in part by lightening their exceptionally heavy tax burden. The plan will cut taxes for manufacturers by some 20 billion euros over the next two years.
To protect himself against giving away too much to businesses, Macron has also allocated 15 billion to schemes training the young and retraining those who have lost their jobs during the pandemic. Prime Minister Jean Castex told national TV that the measures should create 160,000 jobs by the end of next year.
The plan is the first major stimulus to be announced in Europe since the EU passed its recovery fund earlier in the summer (France’s allocation from that fund will cover 40% of the costs of today’s plan).
The timing is opportune: the latest surveys released by consultancy IHS Markit earlier Thursday showed the recovery in the euro zone running out of steam as attempts to rescue the summer tourism season led to a second wave of infections across the continent. France, the world’s most visited country, has seen the sharpest rise in new Covid-19 cases after Spain, and its composite purchasing managers index fell sharply to 51.6 in August from 57.1 in July.
If the plan can put France’s economy back on a growth footing, then the chance of the CAC 40 closing a significant performance gap this year with Germany’s DAX improves substantially.
The CAC is still down over 14% year-to-date while the DAX has now made it across the gain line for 2020. To a degree, that’s down to the heavy index weightings of banks (  BNP Paribas  SA (PA:BNPP),  Credit Agricole  SA (PA:CAGR) and  Societe Generale  SA (PA:SOGN) are all down over 30%) and aerospace (the CAC includes not just Airbus (PA:AIR) but  Thales  (PA:TCFP) and  Safran  (PA:SAF)). Other big cyclical names such as steelmaker ArcelorMittal SA (AS:MT) and advertising group Publicis (PA:PUBP) have also dragged.
The DAX itself, of course, is hardly short of cyclical names, and remember that France is Germany's biggest trading partner, so anything that helps the French economy helps German exporters too. But if the rotation out of growth into cyclicals is sustained between now and year-end, then it is arguably the CAC that has the better chances for outperformance."

Administrators at KPMG have appointed broker  CBRE  Group Inc (NYSE:CBRE). to market Intu’s 50% share in the Xanadu mall, according to people with knowledge of the plan. No guide price has been set, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the information is private. The stake was valued at 233.8 million pounds ($311 million) in Intu’s 2019 annual report published in March.
Intu, owner of nine of the U.K’s top 20 shopping centers, fell into administration in June, buckling under the weight of a 4.5 billion-pound debt pile as the pandemic hit rents and shut off rescue options. The company had already agreed to sell off most of its Spanish holdings before the outbreak as it sought to raise cash and win a reprieve from lenders.
The U.K. firm bought the Xanadu mall, which boasts an indoor ski slope and about 220 stores, for 530 million euros ($626 million) in 2017, before selling a 50% stake in the property to Nuveen, the asset manager owned by the Teachers Insurance & Annuity Association of America.
Representatives of KPMG, CBRE and Nuveen declined to comment.
Investors have continued to buy up Spanish retail properties even as deals for U.K. malls collapsed. The country’s lower online retail sales and shorter, turnover-based lease terms have helped prop up rents and values. Spain has also bounced back from lockdown more quickly than the U.K., where shoppers have continued to stay away from stores in greater numbers.
That’s encouraged Intu’s administrators to push ahead with a sales plan for the Madrid mall, which is also less heavily indebted than most of the company’s other properties. Intu’s share was financed with about 131.5 million pounds of debt maturing in 2022 and was well within its borrowing limits at the last valuation, according to Intu’s accounts.

(N:MCD) has filed a trademark infringement notice in Australia after the local unit of Burger King created a similar product called the ""Big Jack,"" according to a local newspaper report on Thursday.
Australian franchise Hungry Jack's released a double layer hamburger in July, similar in construction and appearance to the Big Mac, McDonald's alleges in documents filed with the Federal Court on Aug. 28, the Sydney Morning Herald newspaper reported. 
Hungry Jack's ""deliberately adopted or imitated"" the ""distinctive appearance or build"" of the Big Mac, along with its ingredients and tagline; ""two all-beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions – on a sesame seed bun"", McDonald's alleged, according to the report.
Hungry Jacks markets the burger online as comprising ""two flame-grilled 100% Aussie beef patties, topped with melted cheese, special sauce, fresh lettuce, pickles and onions on a toasted sesame seed bun"".
The apparent similarities were picked up by plenty of social media users including one Twitter user named Gino, who tweeted ""Big Jack = Big Mac! Naughty naughty!""
A McDonald’s Australia spokeswoman said it would not be appropriate to comment given the matter was before the court. 
""Hungry Jack’s has not been served any formal documents from the court and, thus, is unable to provide any comment at this stage,"" it said in a statement. 
McDonald's is also seeking damages, interest and costs, as well as an order that Hungry Jack's destroy all ""promotional materials,"" which include physical and electronic advertising, the paper reported. 

When Burger King sought to expand into Australia in the early 1970s it found its name was already trademarked and so its first franchise owner Jack Cowin chose the name Hungry Jack's.

China emphasized its right Thursday to approve or block the sale of technology abroad, confirming it will play a critical role in the sale of TikTok’s U.S. operations to suitors including  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT). and  Oracle Corp  (NYSE:ORCL).
Beijing’s assertion jeopardizes negotiations over the sale of ByteDance Ltd.’s prized international asset, a complex deal already under scrutiny by Donald Trump’s administration. The Chinese government on Friday added several artificial intelligence features to a list of export-restricted technologies, effectively gaining the right to block a deal by targeting features such as the recommendation algorithms essential to the viral video service.
The regulatory changes aren’t targeted at specific companies, Gao Feng, spokesman for the Ministry of Commerce, stressed during a weekly online briefing. But companies should consult with the relevant government agencies should any technology they employ fall under the list, he added.
“If related enterprises are transferring technology abroad during trade, investment or technical cooperation that fall under the regulations, they are advised to immediately consult provincial-level commerce department offices and handle that in accordance with the law,” he said.

Beijing’s last-minute entry and its opaque deal-approval process increase the likelihood a sale could get held up and Trump will then move ahead with a TikTok ban ahead of November’s election. It’s likely the need for approval from two geopolitical rivals will push any final deal beyond the November vote in the U.S., a person familiar with the matter has said.
ByteDance founder Zhang Yiming is now said to be reconsidering his options and may well seize upon Beijing’s last-minute involvement to tie up a deal. For China, the move helps it gain leverage to prevent what state-run media called the “theft” of technology while underscoring to the U.S. it has intellectual property worth protecting.

387,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 03, 2020 04:05AM ET</span>","European shares hit over one-month high ahead of services, retail sales data","By Ambar Warrick
(Reuters) - European shares rose on Thursday amid signs of a global economic recovery and hopes of more stimulus measures, with eyes on local service-sector and retail sales data that is likely to show sustained growth.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index (STOXX) rose 1%, tracking a strong session in Asia after a survey showed activity in China's service sector grew for a fourth straight month in August.
Travel and leisure stocks (SXTP) led gains across Europe on hopes of a COVID-19 vaccine, while bank stocks (SX7P) bounced back after three straight sessions of losses.
French drugmaker Sanofi (PA:SASY) and its British peer GSK (L:GSK) rose after they announced starting of a clinical trial for a protein-based COVID-19 vaccine candidate.
While the STOXX 600 hit a more than one-month high, it still stayed within a trading range seen since early-June. The index needs to close at least 15 points higher to break out of the range. 
Data from the euro zone is expected to show service-sector growth for a second straight month across the bloc.
But activity in Spain and Italy contracted in August after the countries introduced new curbs in the wake of increased COVID-19 cases.
A separate reading is expected to show a continued uptrend in euro zone retail sales over July, after volumes were seen returning to pre-pandemic levels in June. 
""Retail sales should capture the strongest part of the economic bounce-back. Consumers have emerged from the lockdown with money to spend and a desire to spend it,"" Paul Donovan, Chief Economist at UBS Global Wealth Management wrote in a note.
""Trade data suggests that they are spending on things, not services. Retail sales may underreport this, given structural shifts in consumption patterns.""
In corporate news, Germany's Siemens Healthineers (DE:SHLG) fell 4.5% after it issued 2.73 billion euros ($3.22 billion) worth of new shares to help finance its planned takeover of U.S. peer Varian (N:VAR).

French consulting and IT services provider Capgemini (PA:CAPP) rose 2.5% after it said it expected double-digit revenue growth in 2020 driven by a gradual second-half recovery.

The news comes two days after India's Supreme Court ruled that mobile carriers must settle government dues within 10 years, giving Vodafone Idea some reprieve in a case that it had said could affect its ability to continue as a going concern.
Vodafone Idea, a joint venture between Britain's Vodafone Group Plc (L:VOD) and India's  Idea Cellular , still owes roughly 500 billion rupees ($6.8 billion) to the Indian government. It is among India's top three telecom firms by subscribers.
Vodafone Idea's stake-sale talks had been paused pending the court ruling, but Amazon and Verizon are now set to resume discussions, Mint reported https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/amazon-verizon-may-give-voda-idea-lifeline-11599102122521.html, citing two unnamed people aware of the negotiations.
Amazon and Verizon did not return emails seeking comment outside regular U.S. business hours.
Shares in Vodafone Idea were up 9.6% at 10.85 rupees by 0645 GMT.
The Financial Times reported in May that Alphabet Inc's Google (O:GOOGL) was considering buying a roughly 5% stake in Vodafone Idea. Reuters reported in June that Amazon was in talks to buy a stake in Vodafone Idea's Indian rival  Bharti Airtel  (NS:BRTI).
Separately on Thursday, Indian news channel CNBC-TV 18 reported https://twitter.com/CNBCTV18Live/status/1301401243047268352 that Vodafone Idea could ""take stock"" of a sale of its optic fibre business at a Friday board meeting scheduled to consider a fundraising plan.
Canada's  Brookfield Asset Management  Inc (TO:BAMa) and private equity group KKR (N:KKR) were contenders for the business, with Brookfield seen as the frontrunner, CNBC-TV 18 said.

Vodafone Idea declined to comment on ""speculation"" when contacted by Reuters. Representatives for Brookfield and KKR did not immediately return Reuters emails seeking comment.

Vegard Soeraunet, until recently an investment director at Norway's ODIN Fund Management, will be in charge of ""long-term and active ownership"" outside of Seatankers's shipping and offshore oil services industries, the company said.
""Getting the opportunity to take this to the next level with a new structure under Seatankers, is a great opportunity,"" Soeraunet said in a statement.
It was the second key appointment at Seatankers in recent days following the Aug. 28 naming of a hedge fund manager as its new chief executive.
While Fredriksen initially built his fortune from shipping, controlling oil tanker group Frontline (OL:FRO) and dry bulk operator Golden Ocean (O:GOGL), he has since expanded into fish farming, real estate and other businesses.
""Seatankers holds a lot of expertise and gets access to many interesting investment opportunities and even though we always have a lot of free capital available, there are many good opportunities we must let go,"" said Kathrine Fredriksen, one of founder John Fredriksen's two daughters.
""The idea is that we take advantage of this, in the new company, opening up for external capital,"" she said.
Seatankers will continue to build its investment team and establish long-term structures until the end of 2020, the company added.
John Fredriksen, 76, last year told Norwegian media he could seek outside investors to take larger stakes in some of his companies and could even relinquish control of some operations.

In addition to Frontline and Golden Ocean, Seatankers is the top shareholder of fish farmer Mowi (OL:MOWI), real estate group Norwegian Property (OL:NPRO) and oil rig operator  Seadrill  (OL:SDRL), among others.

Investing.com - European stock markets posted strong gains Thursday, helped by France launching a new stimulus plan that includes a big lightening of the tax burden for its corporate sector.
At 3:35 AM ET (0735 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 1.5% higher, the CAC 40 in France rose 1.6%, while the U.K.'s FTSE index was up 0.8%.
The French government announced Thursday it plans to inject 100 billion euro ($118.3 billion) of stimulus over two years to soften the economic impact of the coronavirus crisis.
The plan offers up in particular 35 billion euros for making the euro zone's second-biggest economy more competitive, 30 billion for more environmentally friendly energy technologies and 25 billion for supporting jobs, Reuters reported, ahead of the official presentation late on Thursday.
Investors will also be paying close attention to the release of services PMI data for Europe later Thursday to see if there has been a pickup in business activity in hard-hit sectors of the service economy.
Early news from Spain wasn’t encouraging, with the service sector there falling into contraction in August, as attempts to host the vital summer tourist season led to a surge in coronavirus cases and renewed local lockdowns. The PMI fell to 47.7, from 51.9 in July. 
Earlier Thursday, China's service sector activity grew for a fourth straight month in August, with the Caixin services PMI index staying above the 50-mark even while dropping to 54.0 from 54.1 in July. Companies surveyed hired more people for the first time since January.
The news was less good in Japan, with the third-largest economy in the world reporting an August services PMI of 45, below July’s 45.4.
In corporate news, Capgemini (PA:CAPP) stock rose 2.3% after the French consulting and IT services provider said it expected double-digit revenue growth in 2020 driven by a gradual second-half recovery.
Staying in France,  Iliad  (PA:ILD) gained 0.6% after the telecommunications company reported rising first half net profit and revenue despite taking a hit from the coronavirus pandemic. Drinks companies  Remy Cointreau  (PA:RCOP) and Campari (MI:CPRI) both hit their highest level in a year.
Oil prices weakened Thursday, continuing Wednesday’s sharp losses amid concerns about the demand for fuel given a patchy U.S. economic recovery.
The Energy Information Administration recorded a drop to 8.78 million barrels per day in U.S. gasoline demand last week, from 9.16 million b/d a week earlier.
U.S. crude futures traded 0.7% lower at $41.23 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract fell 1% to $43.99. Both benchmark contracts saw falls of more than 2% on Wednesday, with WTI sliding to its lowest close in nearly four weeks and Brent at its lowest since Aug. 21.
Elsewhere, gold futures fell 0.2% to $1,941.35/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.3% lower at 1.1816.

MADRID (Reuters) - Zara-owner  Inditex 's (MC:ITX) little-known budget brand Lefties started online sales in Spain and Portugal on Thursday, giving the label a digital advantage over discount fashion chain Primark in its second-biggest market.
Lefties sells low-priced clothing for women, men and children and is present in six countries - Spain, Portugal, Russia, Mexico, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia - with over 100 stores. 
First set up in 1999 as a way to clear Zara clothing from previous seasons, Lefties now has its own designers and ranges. However, it has little visibility compared to Inditex's main brands like Zara, Massimo Dutti and Bershka and it does not appear on the list of brands on the Spanish company's website.
A Lefties store on Madrid's central shopping drag Gran Vía sells short printed dresses for 12.99 euros ($15.33) and cotton candy-striped shirts for 8.99 euros - a similar price point to clothing on sale at the flagship Primark store next door.
Primark, owned by Associated British Foods (L:ABF), is active on social media but has no online offer. Associated British Foods finance chief John Bason said in June Primark would not rethink its lack of online offer.
Online sales have soared during the COVID-19 pandemic due to shuttered stores and shopper reluctance to return to busy streets and malls. 
But the cost of servicing those orders eats into margins even before factoring in returns, especially on low-cost items.
Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) calculates that online would not be profitable for Primark if it were to offer free online delivery and returns and estimates a margin drop of 5 percentage points if it were to offer online through click and collect only.
""Inditex has the infrastructure and IT capabilities from across its other brands to make online work for a budget brand. Primark would have to set it up from scratch,"" said Societe Generale analyst Anne Critchlow.
Inditex did not say whether it planned to expand online sales to other countries where Lefties has a presence. A company spokesman declined to comment further. 
The Lefties site, which does not deliver outside Spain or Portugal, offered a standard delivery fee of 3.99 euros. At sister site Zara, deliveries are 3.95 euros or free for purchases over 30 euros in Spain.

395,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 03, 2020 03:00AM ET</span>",Ant’s Mega IPO Sets Up Jack Ma to Escalate War With Tencent,"(Bloomberg) --
Ant Group’s late-summer IPO filing drove home why the business -- backed by 711 million monthly users that spent $17 trillion through its platform -- is headed for potentially the world’s largest stock debut. Yet investors may do well to focus on the long-term threat to its core businesses from arch rival Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) Ltd.
Ant is set to join the top echelon of global finance alongside Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC)., as it seeks to raise about $30 billion with a valuation of about $225 billion in Hong Kong and Shanghai, people familiar have said. Once the dust settles, the crown jewel of Jack Ma’s  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd. empire has to contend with a renewed challenge from old nemesis Tencent that’s increasingly encroaching on its turf from payments to wealth management.
China’s two largest corporations Alibaba and Tencent are wrestling for online leadership in everything from social entertainment to e-commerce and cloud computing. The key to winning the war is to control the means through which a billion Chinese spend their money online. Alibaba’s 33%-owned Ant and Tencent’s WeChat are the smartphone and payment backbones underpinning the twin internet juggernauts.
“Ant should be wary of the wider Tencent ecosystem, which is taking away its payments traffic,” said Shawn Yang, a Shenzhen-based managing director for Blue Lotus Capital Advisors Ltd. “Even though Ant has better quality data from the e-commerce transactions it collects, it needs to make sure it’s not losing too much share in the other high-frequency verticals like ride-hailing, food delivery and offline retail.”
One edge Tencent has over Ant is WeChat, the virtual forum for over a billion Chinese and the millions of consumer and gaming apps they use on a daily basis. Its WeChat Pay is the lubricant for a walled-off software and payments ecosystem that connects shoppers with both big names like Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and Didi Chuxing as well as mom-and-pop merchants across the country.
It took just five years for Tencent to carve out a slice of the country’s $36 trillion online payment market, thanks to its bread-and-butter video games and social networks. Once accounting for three quarters of China’s mobile payments landscape, Alipay processed 55% of mobile transactions in the first quarter, with Tencent growing its share to 39%.
“Tencent and Ant are in a brutal battle for traffic and users. They are not only building up their defensive lines but also attacking each other’s territory,” said Ke Yan, a Singapore-based analyst with DZT Research. “If you lose in one arena, you’ll have to catch up in another.”
Now Tencent’s looking to lure merchants and brands away from Alibaba’s online marketplaces by building an e-commerce service on its ubiquitous app WeChat. And it’s stepping up the fight in the payments business, luring traffic especially from companies that are in competition with the wider Alibaba ecosystem.
Tencent’s biggest investees have rallied to its cause. Last month, food delivery giant Meituan Dianping (OTC:MPNGF) stopped accepting Alipay as a payment option for some users and No. 2 Chinese online retailer JD (NASDAQ:JD).com Inc. has long scrapped Alipay in favor of its in-house system and WeChat. “Some of Alibaba’s competitors have cut Alipay off from their platforms because they want to guard their own data and business information, that’s giving Tencent an edge,” said Cao Lei, director of the China E-Commerce Research Center in Hangzhou.
It’s easier to move around and shop in China’s big cities today with an Alipay or WeChat mobile wallet than it is bearing a pocketbook filled with banknotes. But back in 2004, Alipay was created out of necessity to address trust issues in the early days of online shopping, as a sort of escrow service not unlike PayPal, before it boomed alongside e-commerce.
The rise of WeChat is another story. Tencent’s messaging app launched its payment function as late as 2013 and played catch-up by digitalizing the centuries-old Chinese tradition of giving away red envelopes filled with money during the Lunar New Year. The marketing gimmick quickly spurred users to link their bank accounts to WeChat, who then began to send money to their friends and make purchases through WeChat’s platform. In the ensuing years, Alipay has had to engage in costly red-envelope giveaway campaigns to win back users.
Ant now envisions growing beyond just fintech -- an ambition marked by the change of its registered name from Ant Financial Services Group to Ant Group Co. in May this year. That’s because it faces stiff competition in the battle to provide everyday consumer services from food delivery to hotel and travel booking, an arena where Tencent holds a first-mover advantage by embedding lite apps or mini programs within WeChat’s platform.
The all-in-one app concept has been emulated by Ant. Alipay today hosts over two million mini programs discoverable by users through the in-app search or customized home page, according to its prospectus, and the company said in June that it has 600 million monthly active users. Tencent said in May the daily active users of WeChat’s mini programs has surpassed 400 million.
Despite Tencent’s dominance of the media and daily consumer sphere, the most lucrative business for both companies still comes from financial services built on top of the payments backbone. That’s where Ant is more adept.
As disruptors to the country’s old-guard banks, Alipay and WeChat leveraged their ubiquitous apps to provide users with short-term loans, insurance, wealth management products and other financial services with much easier access and enticing rates.
The growth of non-traditional finance however has caught regulators’ attention. Beijing approved new rules this week to tighten oversight of the sector, mandating that non-financial firms or individuals with businesses that straddle at least two financial sectors and meet certain asset thresholds will be classified as “financial holding companies” and must apply for licenses.

The move came as online lending to consumers and small businesses overtook mobile payments as Ant’s largest revenue source, accounting for 39% of the 72 billion yuan ($10.5 billion) business in the first half, according to its prospectus.
“One of the most important traffic generators for Tencent is WeChat, the product is too intertwined with the wider Tencent ecosystem and was never spun off like Alipay,” said Xu Yinghao, chief executive officer of Hangzhou-based researcher Civedata. “In that sense, Ant has consolidated its financial related services much better.”

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Asian equities pared early gains on Thursday amid growing worries about Sino-U.S. relations while the euro hit a one-week low as traders wagered on central bank action to tame the single currency.
In early European trade, the pan-region Euro Stoxx 50 futures and German DAX futures added 0.6% each, FTSE futures climbed 0.2% while {{167|France's CACAC 40 futures rose 0.4%. 
U.S. stock futures, the S&P 500 e-minis, faltered 0.3%.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside of Japan, which was up more than 0.5% earlier in the session, slipped 0.1% with Chinese and Hong Kong shares leading the losses. 
The Hang Seng fell 0.7% while China's blue-chip index was 0.5% lower.
A Bloomberg news report that China was planning sweeping policy changes to its semiconductor industry to fight U.S. restrictions added fuel to ongoing concerns about deteriorating relations between the world's two biggest economies, analysts said. 
Bloomberg reported, citing sources, China was planning a suite of measures to bolster research, education and financing for the chip industry as part of its five-year plan next month.
The move comes after the United States said on Wednesday it would now require senior Chinese diplomats to get State Department approval before visiting U.S. university campuses or holding cultural events with more than 50 people outside mission grounds.
Fears of a further escalation in tensions overshadowed positive data showing China's service sector activity grew for a fourth straight month in August to stay above the 50-mark.
Elsewhere, Australia's S&P/ASX 200 rose 0.9% and Japan's Nikkei added 0.9% while South Korea's KOSPI index added 1.2%. 
While analysts generally expect the equity markets rally to extend further led by massive central bank stimulus, they cautioned against rising risks. 
""I think we're now at a point where tactically it makes sense to be more prudent than two or three months ago as there are still a number of significant risks for investors to contend with,"" said Scott Berg, portfolio manager of T. Rowe Price's global growth equity strategy.
""The economic recovery remains fragile and there is still considerable uncertainty over the growth trajectory beyond the initial rebound phase,"" Berg said.
China-U.S. tensions and U.S. presidential elections were other major risks, with a Democrat victory likely seeing a ""major switch in policy direction and a different regulatory and tax regime,"" he added.
On Wall Street overnight, the three major equity indexes moved higher with gains led by defensive sectors such as utilities as the high-flying tech sector paused.
Data on Wednesday showed U.S. private employers hired fewer workers than expected for a second straight month in August, suggesting that the labour market recovery was slowing.
A separate report showed factory orders rose more than expected in July, pointing to continued improvement in the manufacturing sector.
In currencies, the euro slipped 0.4% to $1.1803 after the Financial Times reported that several members of the European Central Bank's (ECB) governing council were concerned that the euro's rise could weigh on the region's growth.
That followed remarks on Tuesday from ECB's chief economist Philip Lane, who said the exchange ""does matter"" for monetary policy, which had begun the euro's descent from above $1.20.
Westpac currency strategist Sean Callow said the FT report was ""stoking some interest in next week's ECB meeting at the very least.""
The dollar rose against a basket of currencies to be up 0.3%. It was slightly higher on the safe haven Japanese yen at 106.25.

The potential transaction could take the U.S. bank's stake from 51% to 71% as it edges closer to full ownership of a securities entity in China at a time when geopolitical relations between the United States and China remain fragile.
A JPMorgan spokesman declined to comment on the likely sale.
The state-owned Shanghai Waigaoqiao FTZ is selling its stake in the joint venture, which made a net loss of 86.8 million yuan in 2019, according to its filing on the Shanghai United Assets and Equity Exchange. 
JPMorgan was the only candidate that could raise its ownership with priority rights in the securities joint venture, the filing showed, as the remaining four shareholders had given up their rights to purchase the 20% stake.
The securities joint venture consists of investment banking, research, equities and fixed income businesses.
JPMorgan's development came after  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) received regulatory approval on Wednesday to take full ownership of a custodian business in mainland China.
China has overhauled regulations to grant foreign firms greater access to its financial sector which is worth trillions of dollars. 
It has also allowed foreign institutions to fully own companies in the securities and mutual fund sectors since April 1, positioning Wall Street and European banks to compete for a slice of the world's second-largest economy. 

JPMorgan received regulatory approval last December to establish the 51%-owned securities joint venture. The U.S. bank planned to hire at least 12 equity research analysts in China this year, Reuters reported in May, in its first major mainland hiring push.

MUMBAI (Reuters) - Speedo International will investigate a report of possible human rights violations by its Indian partner  Page Industries  (NS:PAGE), which Norway's wealth fund dropped from its portfolio this week, the United Kingdom-based swimwear maker told Reuters.
Norway's $1 trillion sovereign wealth fund, the world's largest, on Monday said that ""unacceptable risk"" due to human rights violation led to exclusion of some companies including Page, which is the exclusive licensee for Speedo and innerwear maker Jockey International in India.
The fund's decision was based on its Council on Ethics' findings which flagged these concerns and also said that Page had violated national regulations on issues such as fire safety.
While Page manufactures Speedo products in only one Indian factory which was not mentioned in the Council's report and was found compliant in an audit, the British company said it was concerned about the findings which it will investigate further.
""We take all matters relating to workers and violation of human rights extremely seriously,"" Speedo said in a statement late on Wednesday in response to Reuters queries.
""We are naturally concerned to hear about the findings of the Council ... and we will investigate and follow up with the licensee as a matter of urgency.""
Jockey did not respond to requests for comment.
India's Page Industries also did not immediately respond. The company's website says it had employed more than 20,000 people by 2018 and had operations spread across 15 manufacturing complexes in India.
The Norway's fund's ethics council report said the abuses were found in one of Page's factories in the southern city of Bengaluru, describing it as ""a pattern of behaviour.""
Page ""does little"" to prevent the abuse of labour rights in its operations, failed provide information on the findings and did not permit an inspection of the factory, the Council report said.
Page has so far not commented on the report or the Norway fund's decision to exclude the company from its portfolio.

LONDON (Reuters) - Joining a new company can be tough at the best of times, with bosses to impress, skills to learn and new colleagues to befriend.
But that task becomes a whole lot harder when the ""onboarding"" is done during a pandemic that has forced millions to work from home, leaving new hires to judge colleagues on their taste in curtains and conduct on Zoom. 
The companies that get it right should have an expanded, grateful workforce, but get it wrong and new hires could find it hard to develop team spirit or a sense of belonging to the firm.
One young trader hired by a major European bank as the British lockdown began said remote working had made corporate culture even tougher to navigate.
""It's not exactly easy for your new boss to explain the specifics of office politics to you without putting their foot in it,"" she said, declining to be named due to company policy.
""It does feel like it's taking longer to feel loyalty to my new employer than it might have otherwise. I feel loyal to the team but not to the wider bank.""
A new joiner at a different, London-based bank said his interviewers had appeared to study his bookshelves and photos while asking questions, and that he does not expect to meet his colleagues in person until next year, although he joined in May.
For Sam Thompson, who joined money saving and investment app MoneyBox, a lack of face-to-face contact did make some early interactions with colleagues feel more transactional. But he appreciated the lengths the company has gone to to make it work.
""We've been getting Deliveroo vouchers and we've been sitting around our computers while talking to one another and having lunch,"" he said. ""It's probably the best induction into a company that I've ever had,"" said the Quality Assurance Engineer, who has had several jobs in six years in the industry.
Founded in 2016, MoneyBox has taken on 35 new hires during the lockdown to a total headcount of 135. It initially held off from filling roles requiring interaction with multiple teams, such as developers, Jack Johnstone, head of HR and talent, said, but overcame those fears.
Its approach mirrors those of major banks including Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF), Citi and  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), which have all rapidly redesigned their interview and orientation process.
Citi hired around 3,840 new staff in its Institutional Clients Group Operations & Technology between March and August. 
Once a new hire is appointed, MoneyBox and the banks send out a joining manual or welcoming video along with the required technology.
Virtual face-to-face meetings are held much more regularly with managers, buddy partners are formed with existing staff and an array of tech platforms are used to maintain communication. 
Meetings with different teams and online social events are encouraged to help staff build broader networks and replicate the 'chance meetings' they may have had in canteens and lifts.
DRINKS ANYONE?
Andy Halford, chief financial officer of Standard Chartered, told Reuters online drinks and other social events were vital. 
""Some people find it easier to talk and connect when they are not ‘at work’,"" he said. ""We want to humanise this situation for everyone.""
Professor Nicholas Bloom at Stanford University said new hires unable to meet colleagues in person would struggle with unspoken rules - from how many hours people really work to when to take a break and what to wear.
For graduates, who often work long hours when joining banks or big law firms, that poses another risk. ""At home it generates a strong incentive for over-communication, so endlessly sending unnecessary emails and slack messages just to highlight the fact that you're still there,"" Bloom said.
Still, McKinsey Partner Alexander DiLeonardo said new hires have to work harder to network. ""When you aren't sitting next to your new colleagues or outside your supervisor’s office, you have to be intentional about reaching out,"" he said.

Investing.com - European stock markets are set to open mixed Thursday, helped by France launching a new stimulus plan but amid caution ahead of key services economic data.
At 2:05 AM ET (0605 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.4% lower, CAC 40 futures in France climbed 0.4%, while the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. rose 0.2%. 
The French government announced Thursday it plans to inject 100 billion euro ($118.3 billion) of stimulus over two years to soften the economic impact of the coronavirus crisis.
The plan offers up in particular 35 billion euros for making the euro zone's second-biggest economy more competitive, 30 billion for more environmentally friendly energy technologies and 25 billion for supporting jobs, Reuters reported, ahead of the official presentation late on Thursday.
Earlier Thursday, China's service sector activity grew for a fourth straight month in August, with the Caixin services PMI index staying above the 50-mark even while dropping to 54.0 from 54.1 in July, Companies surveyed hired more people for the first time since January.
The services sector, which accounts for about 60% of the economy, had been slower to return to growth initially than manufacturing, but its recovery has gathered pace in recent months.
The news was less good in Japan, with the third-largest economy in the world reporting an August services PMI of 45, below July’s 45.4, indicating a contracting sector.
With this in mind, investors will be paying close attention to the release of services PMI data for Europe later Thursday to see if there has been a pickup in business activity in hard-hit sectors of the service economy.
In corporate news, French consulting and IT services provider Capgemini (PA:CAPP) is likely to be in focus after it said it expected double-digit revenue growth in 2020 driven by a gradual second-half recovery.
Oil prices edged lower Thursday, continuing Wednesday’s sharp losses amid concerns about the demand for fuel given a patchy U.S. economic recovery.
Although the Energy Information Administration detailed a 9.362 million-barrel draw in crude oil supply for the week ended August 28, much bigger than expected, it also recorded a drop to 8.78 million barrels per day in U.S. gasoline demand, from 9.16 million b/d a week earlier.
U.S. private employers hiring fewer workers than expected for a second straight month in August, also fed fears that the economic recovery was lagging. 
U.S. crude futures traded 0.2% lower at $41.42 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract fell 0.4% to $44.27. Both benchmark contracts saw falls of more than 2% on Wednesday, with WTI sliding to its lowest close in nearly four weeks and Brent at its lowest since Aug. 21.
Elsewhere, gold futures fell 0.3% to $1,939.40/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.4% lower at 1.1803."
404,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 03, 2020 01:45AM ET</span>","Capgemini sees double-digit 2020 revenue growth, second-half recovery","(Reuters) - French consulting and IT services provider Capgemini (PA:CAPP) said on Thursday it expected double-digit revenue growth in 2020 driven by a gradual second-half recovery, crediting diversification for its resilience during the coronavirus crisis.
The company said it planned to reach revenue growth at constant exchange rates of between 12.5% and 14.0% this year. 
""We set objectives for 2020 that illustrate the resilience of our revenues, profitability and organic free cash
flow,"" Chief Executive Officer Aiman Ezzat said in a statement.
Capgemini said the sector and geographic diversification of the client base developed in recent years have reinforced the resilience of its business.
The group, however, warned that a sharp deterioration in health conditions or the economic environment in the coming months could undermine the attainment of its objectives.
In July, Ezzat said the French group expected ""a gradual recovery"" in the third and fourth quarter, but offered no detailed targets.
Capgemini, which operates in nearly 50 countries, offers its services to industries ranging from telecom to aerospace. In June 2019, it took over a smaller rival Altran to respond to customers' needs to outsource engineers as well as research and development teams. 
Capgemini also said it expected an operating margin reduction of 0.6 to 0.9 points compared to the 2019 rate of 12.3%. It said its net profit declined by 20% to 311 million euros ($367.20 million) in the first half of the year and confirmed an organic revenue decline of 3.4% reported in preliminary figures in July.
Capgemini rival Accenture (N:ACN) narrowed its fiscal 2020 revenue growth forecast to between 3.5% and 4.5% amid the coronavirus-fueled economic slump.

405,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 03, 2020 01:10AM ET</span>",Brazil prosecutors ask court to remove Vale managers over safety concerns,"By Sabrina Valle and Marta Nogueira
Rio de Janeiro (Reuters) - Federal prosecutors in Brazil's Minas Gerais state are seeking a court order for miner Vale SA (NYSE:VALE) to replace executives they accuse of disregarding safety methods in the aftermath of two deadly mining disasters. 
They have asked a court in Minas Gerais to name an interventor to take charge of Vale's safety program, according to a statement the prosecutors' office shared with Reuters. 
The prosecutors have also asked all dividend payments be suspended until the interventor confirms Vale is cooperating. Vale plans to resume payouts next month, which Fitch estimates will come in at more than $2 billion for the year.
The request would require approval by the court.
Vale could not be immediately reached for a comment outside regular business hours.
Prosecutors said they want the interventor to identify within 15 days executive managers and other top management members who should be replaced in a corporate reshuffle.
The interventor would be charged with drawing up a plan to reshape Vale's governance system to comply with international standards for disaster prevention, the prosecutors said.
The governance system currently adopted by the mining company has generated extensive damage to society and to the environment, the prosecutors say. 
The so-called Brumadinho task force of prosecutors was set up after a January 2019 disaster at a Vale mine where a dam burst, killing 270 people. An earlier dam burst occurred in 2015 at a mine in Mariana owned jointly by Vale and BHP Group (NYSE:BHP) Ltd causing Brazil's worst environmental disaster.
The prosecutors said that, contrary to what Vale has stated and the data it discloses, it has developed over time an internal culture that is unable to recognize safety threats.
The company acts on ""corporate irresponsibility"", they say, and needs a reshuffle to change its culture to start taking preventative safety measures. 

Earlier on Wednesday, Vale said it put on watch three dams and three dikes after failing to meet the security requirements during regular reviews by third party auditors.

Investing.com – Asian stocks were mostly up on Thursday morning, with services sector data released by Japan and China earlier in the day slightly lower than expected.
Japan reported an August services Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) of 45, slightly below July’s 45.4, while China's Caixin services PMI for August was 54 against July’s reading of 54.1. Although China stayed above the 50-mark indicating expansion, the Japanese reading remained below the mark.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 rose 1.28% by 11:56 PM ET (4:56 AM GMT). Yoshihide Suga announced his candidacy for the Liberal Democratic Party leadership on Wednesday and formally entered the contest to succeed Shinzo Abe as the country's next prime minister.
China’s Shanghai Composite edged down 0.06% and the Shenzhen Component was up 0.49%.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index was down 0.40%, with the city set to relax its social distancing measures even further. Dine-in hours at restaurants will extended by an hour to 10pm and gyms will be allowed to reopen from Friday.
South Korea’s KOSPI jumped 1.47% and the ASX 200 gained 0.80%.
Some investors expect a stock rally to extend further over the “easy money” perception but warned of risks ahead.
“I think we’re now at a point where tactically it makes sense to be more prudent than two or three months ago as there are still a number of significant risks for investors to contend with,” said Scott Berg, portfolio manager of T. Rowe Price’s global growth equity strategy, told Reuters.
“The economic recovery remains fragile and there is still considerable uncertainty over the growth trajectory beyond the initial rebound phase,” he added.
Meanwhile, the U.S. released data painting a mixed picture for economic recovery, with a possible slowdown in the labor market’s recovery as the number of COVID-19 continues to rise globally and government funding to support both employers and employees starts to dry up. ADP nonfarm employment data showed that U.S. private employers hired 428,000 workers in August, much lower than the forecasted 950,000. The U.S. Federal Reserve’s Beige Book also showed an increase in furloughed workers losing their jobs permanently in some parts of the U.S.
Separate data also showed that U.S. factory orders rose 6.4% month-on-month in July, slightly higher than the predicted 6%.
The U.S. and Europe are also due to release PMI figures later in the day.
However, some investors struck a warning note over stocks’ overreliance on central bank stimulus measures.
“Markets continue to show unrestrained faith in the capacity of central bank liquidity to chart a relatively smooth path for the global economy out of the COVID-19 challenges,” GSFM investment strategist Stephen Miller told Bloomberg."
407,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 02, 2020 09:36PM ET</span>",Singapore Stocks Tipped to Beat Asian Peers on Cyclical Rebound,"(Bloomberg) -- Follow Bloomberg on LINE messenger for all the business news and analysis you need.
Stocks in Singapore appear to be the best-placed in Asia Pacific to benefit from a potential cyclical recovery and success in finding a cure for the coronavirus, analysts say.
Cheap valuations, strong links to the global economy and better control over the virus outbreak are all seen working to the advantage of shares in the city-state, where cyclicals such as financials and real estate command a more than 80% weighting in the benchmark index.
“We rate Singapore one of our most-preferred markets in the region,” backed by “recession valuations” and expectations of an earnings recovery, said Hartmut Issel, head of APAC equities and credit at UBS Global Wealth Management.
Stocks whose fortunes are heavily tied to business cycles are gaining investor attention amid nascent signs of a revival in world trade, some improvement in Asia’s manufacturing gauges and promising updates by drugmakers racing to develop a coronavirus vaccine. Analysts forecast the Straits Times Index to climb about 16% over the next 12 months, versus an 11% gain seen for the broader MSCI Asia Pacific Index.
Top Analyst Bets Big on Small Singapore Stocks On Vaccine Hopes
At about 84%, the weighting of cyclical stocks in the STI gauge makes for the highest exposure among major benchmarks in the Asia Pacific region. That’s even after excluding pandemic winners like technology and communication services. Banks -- 41%, real estate -- 22% and industrials -- 17% are the most dominant sectors.
HSBC Private Banking is betting on dividend-paying property managers as Singapore strives to resume business activities. Meanwhile UBS favors banks, citing their regionalized business model, which means lenders will benefit once economies rebound. Any rise in U.S. Treasury yields will also be a boon for their net interest margins.
Singapore Stocks Shine in Asia Boosted by Rising U.S. Yields
That said, many things need to fall in place for a sustained rebound in the city-state’s shares.
The trade-reliant economy shrank by a record margin last quarter, and the government expects a contraction of 5%-7% this year. While only a handful of daily new virus cases are registered recently, Singapore has faced a tumultuous road coping with the issue, and Trade and Industry Minister Chan Chun Sing last month warned of “recurring waves of infection and disruption.”
The STI was down 0.6% as of 9:21 a.m. local time after the whole economy purchasing managers’ index in August fell further from July.
This year’s steep decline -- the second-worst in Asia Pacific -- has cheapened the valuation of shares. Down 22% so far, the STI gauge is trading at 0.9 times its estimated book value, versus an average of 1.2 over the past decade.
“If there is a rise in global rates coupled with a strong domestic economic and earnings recovery, the Singapore market could do well vis-à-vis the peers,” said James Cheo, HSBC’s chief market strategist for Southeast Asia.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The S&P 500 closed higher on Wednesday for the ninth time in the past 10 sessions, with defensive and value stocks taking their turns to lead the gains after data showed U.S. private payrolls expanded last month, but at a much slower pace than expected.
The indexes gained steam in afternoon trading and hit session highs in the final half hour. 
The Federal Reserve's ""Beige Book"" report showed a modest increase in activity for U.S. businesses and an increase in employment through late August, while economic growth remained sluggish in parts of the country.
The blue-chip Dow edged closer to its Feb. 12 record high, coming in just 1.6% below the milestone while the tech-heavy Nasdaq, which closed the session almost 23% above its pre-crisis high, rose at a slower pace on Wednesday. 
While much of the rally from March lows has already been fueled by Federal Reserve support, Lindsey Bell, chief investment strategist at Ally Invest, said investors may still be digesting the central bank's policy announcement last week which indicated continued support. 
""What you're seeing today is a bit of a rotation after yesterday's blockbuster day,"" said Bell. ""Unless you really think tech is going to completely crash it can take a breather and allow some of the other value-oriented and cyclical sectors to take the reins for a while."" 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 454.84 points, or 1.59%, to close at 29,100.5, the S&P 500 gained 54.19 points, or 1.54%, to 3,580.84 and the Nasdaq Composite added 116.78 points, or 0.98%, to 12,056.44.
In comparison the S&P value index rose 1.8% while the growth index added 1.4%.
The defensive utilities, consumer staples and real estate, which have trailed the broader market this year, were some of the biggest gainers among major S&P sectors on Wednesday, rising between 2% and a little over 3%. Health stocks also closed up 2%.
Financials, a value sector which has also sharply underperformed this year, closed up 1.5% on Wednesday. 
The high-flying technology sector ended the day up 0.9%, but at least one trader said investors showed up looking for bargains after it had turned negative in the morning.
""It's buy the dip. Tech got wrecked in the morning and then everyone said this was their big chance to jump in,"" said Dennis Dick, a proprietary trader at Bright Trading LLC in Las Vegas. 
U.S. private payrolls increased last month from July, according to the ADP report, but fell short of economists' forecast. Investors are now waiting for the government's comprehensive employment report which is slated for Friday.
Janet Walker, senior portfolio manager at Abbot Downing in San Francisco, expects Friday's government payroll numbers to also reflect a stalling from July to August. As a result she says it will be important for U.S. lawmakers to reach an agreement for a new fiscal coronavirus relief bill.
Weakness in the jobs report ""could become a bigger risk if there's a delay in stimulus,"" she said. ""For us to continue to recover we're going to need to see additional stimulus.""
Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) Corp, one of the benchmark's biggest boosts on Wednesday, gained after several brokerages hiked their price targets on its shares after its announcement of powerful gaming chips in collaboration with Micron Technology Inc (NASDAQ:MU) and Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) Co Ltd.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.91-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.56-to-1 ratio favored advancers.
The S&P 500 posted 89 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 148 new highs and 45 new lows.

On U.S. exchanges 9.85 billion shares changed hands compared with the 9.12 billion average for the last 20 sessions.

411,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 02, 2020 04:30PM ET</span>","United Airlines to cut 16,370 workers, many more going without pay","By Tracy Rucinski
CHICAGO (Reuters) - United Airlines (O:UAL) said on Wednesday it is preparing to furlough 16,370 workers when federal aid expires on Oct. 1 as the coronavirus pandemic continues to devastate the airline industry, though one union said many more people will be without pay.
United's cuts include 6,920 flight attendants, but the union representing them said 14,000 will not have a paycheck in October unless Congress acts to extend $25 billion in aid.
This is because many have opted for leaves that will provide healthcare but no money, Association of Flight Attendants-CWA International President Sara Nelson said.
""United's furlough announcement does not tell the full story,"" she said.
Airlines have been lobbying Washington for a second stimulus package to protect jobs through March while the industry awaits a recovery. The first $25 billion, which covered airline payrolls, expires this month, but talks have stalled as Congress has struggled to reach agreement on a broader coronavirus assistance package.
Chicago-based United had over 90,000 employees before the pandemic brought the industry to a near standstill in March. It warned in July that 36,000 jobs were at risk of involuntary furloughs as demand remained weak.
U.S. passenger airlines are still collectively losing more than $5 billion a month as 30% of planes remain parked. Passenger travel demand is down about 70% and, on average, planes that are flying are half-full.
Some 7,400 United employees have opted to take early retirement or departure packages and the company is working through several other voluntary temporary leave programs to further reduce the number of furloughs, United officials said, without providing specific numbers.
The leaves would give the company flexibility to call back staff once travel returns, they said.
United's furloughs will also affect around 2,850 pilots, 2,010 mechanics and 1,400 management and administrative positions, among others, though negotiations continue with pilots to reduce the final number.
Rival American Airlines (O:AAL) last week said it would lay off 19,000 workers without federal aid. Including voluntary departures or leaves, its 140,000 pre-pandemic workforce will shrink by 30%.
Delta Air Lines (N:DAL) plans to lay off nearly 2,000 pilots, but has not yet numbered potential cuts for its other workers.
President Donald Trump has said his administration would help U.S. airlines but has not given any details.

412,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 02, 2020 04:05PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Aspiring TikTok buyers pursue four options in effort to revive talks,"By Echo Wang, Greg Roumeliotis and Krystal Hu
(Reuters) - TikTok's prospective buyers are discussing four ways to structure an acquisition from its Chinese owner ByteDance, which include buying the app's U.S. operations without key software, after Beijing stalled a deal which could be worth $30 billion, sources said.
Other options being considered include asking for Chinese approval to pass TikTok's algorithm on to the acquirer of the short video app's U.S. assets, licensing the algorithm from ByteDance, or seeking a transition period from a U.S. national security panel overseeing the deal, three sources said. 
ByteDance had been looking to pick a buyer for TikTok assets by this week so it can finalize a deal by mid-September and comply with President Donald Trump's order to divest those assets, after U.S. officials raised concerns over the safety of the personal data of U.S. citizens handled by TikTok.
""TikTok is loved by 100 million Americans because it's a home for entertainment, self-expression, and connection. We're committed to continuing to bring joy to families and meaningful careers to those who create on our platform for many years to come,"" a TikTok spokeswoman said in a statement.
Beijing last week updated its export control rules to restrict the sale of technology such as the one used by TikTok to recommend videos to users, raising questions over whether it would veto a deal and giving prospective buyers Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) pause for thought.
ByteDance and the bidders for the TikTok assets are now discussing four ways to structure the deal, the sources, who requested anonymity, told Reuters.
It is not clear which, if any, of the options will be pursued. As days pass, the odds of a deal lengthen as TikTok faces a U.S. ban on Sept. 20 if no sale agreement has been reached. It has challenged the ban in court.
One possibility being discussed is to sell TikTok without the algorithm it uses to make recommendations to users. While that would circumvent China's export control rules, it would present a significant gamble for Microsoft and Oracle, which would have to quickly come up with a substitute.
Another option is to negotiate a transition period of up to a year with the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), which is overseeing the deal talks, the sources said. It is not clear whether China's new rules would allow this in the time frame required.
A third option is seeking approval from China to pass on TikTok's algorithm to the buyer of its U.S. assets, the sources said. This would amplify the geopolitical risk, given worsening relations between the world's two largest economies over trade, cyber security and the spread of the coronavirus.
The fourth scenario involves ByteDance's licensing the algorithm to the buyer of the TikTok assets, the sources said. However, this could worry CFIUS, which wants ByteDance to forego any relationship it has with TikTok in the United States.
ByteDance, Microsoft and Oracle declined to comment. The White House, CFIUS and China's Commerce Department did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
TikTok is functionally and technically similar to ByteDance-owned Douyin, which is available only in China, and shares technical resources with it and other ByteDance-owned properties, sources have previously said.
While the code for the app, which determines the look and feel of TikTok, has been separated from Douyin, the server code powering the algorithms for moderating and recommending content and the management of user profiles is partially shared.
DANCE TRACKED?
While TikTok is best known for videos of people dancing that go viral among teenagers, U.S. officials have expressed concern that user information could be passed to Beijing.
TikTok has said it would not comply with any request to share user data with the Chinese authorities. 
ByteDance has been in talks to sell TikTok's North American, Australian and New Zealand operations since last month. And in a sign of founder and CEO Zhang Yiming's concern, TikTok engineers were told last week to make contingencies should TikTok need to shut down its U.S. operations. 
Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc said last week it was joining Microsoft in its bid for TikTok's U.S. assets, hours after the app's recently named chief executive, Kevin Mayer, said he would step down. Walmart declined to comment. 

Oracle, whose Chairman Larry Ellison is one of the technology world's few supporters of Trump, has partnered with some of ByteDance's investors, including General Atlantic and Sequoia, on its bid for the TikTok assets.

Investing.com – The Dow rallied Wednesday to close above 29,000 for the first time in more than six months amid runaway gains in utilities as investors weighed signs of slack in the labor market.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.59%, or 453 points to 29,099, its highest level since Feb. 20, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite rose 1.56% and 0.98% respectively to close at record highs.
Defensive corners of the market were in favor, with utilities leading to the upside thanks to a jump in Exelon (NASDAQ:EXC) and PPL (NYSE:PPL).
Consumer staples also participated in the rally thanks to a more than 4% rise in Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) and 10% jump in whiskey maker Brown Forman (NYSE:BFb).
Brown Forman reported first-quarter fiscal first-quarter earnings of 67 cents on revenue of $753 million, topping estimates for earnings of 39 cents a share, on revenue of $691.2 million.
Technology lagged the broader move higher as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) eased 2%, though still remains up about 80% for the year so far. Shares of Apple have been underpinned by growing investor optimism over its upcoming launch of the iPhone 12, which many Wall Street analysts expect will spark a wave of upgrades.
Energy, meanwhile, continued its sluggish start to the week on falling oil prices despite data showing a larger-than-expected 9.3 million barrel draw in weekly U.S. crude stocks.
On the economic front, investors digested data showing the U.S. economy created 428,000 private jobs last month, well short of estimates of 950,000.
""ADP’s measure has undershot the official estimate of private payrolls in recent months, but the error diminished sharply in both June and July.  Assuming a further narrowing of the gap in August, we expect Friday’s official headline print to be about 750,000,"" Pantheon Macroeconomics said.
Still, the somber jobs report did little to cool expectations for a strong economic recovery at a time when consumer spending continues to gather steam.
""Consumer spending continued to pick up, sparked by strong vehicle sales and some improvements in tourism and retail sectors,"" according to the Fed's Beige Book report. ""But many Districts noted a slowing pace of growth in these areas, and total spending was still far below pre-pandemic levels.""

414,By Investing.com,"<span>Sep 02, 2020 03:57PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: 3 Things to Watch for September 3,"By Liz Moyer
Investing.com -- In typical pandemic fashion, private payroll numbers for August came in at less than half of expectations, igniting another stock market rally on Wednesday.
Markets reflect a topsy-turvy world where the latest moves are seemingly unconnected to reality.
The dollar surged against the EUR/USD, pushing Gold Futures down $30 after the yellow metal pierced through the $2,000 an ounce level last month. The dollar's move came on expectations the European Central Bank would inject more stimulus into the eurozone.
Crude Oil WTI Futuresprices sank nearly 3% after government data showed a steeper than expected drawdown in U.S. oil inventory last week. Stocks are soaring though data from the Federal Reserve shows the economic comeback slowed last month.
Congress continues to stall on another pandemic relief package that could put more money into consumer pockets this fall to spur spending. Big companies, meanwhile, continue to layoff thousands as earlier relief runs out. United Airlines Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:UAL) became the latest in that sector to announce it would furlough 16,000 workers by early October.
The Dow Jones Industrial Averagesurged nearly 500 points. The S&P 500 and NASDAQ Composite hit record highs, with Nasdaq pushing through 12,000.
Here are three things that could affect the markets tomorrow:
1. High expectations for stay-at-home boost at DocuSign
 DocuSign Inc  (NASDAQ:DOCU) is a beneficiary of stay-at-home orders that forced businesses to move online. Its shares are at all-time highs, hitting yet another 52-week high on Wednesday, and definitely got a jolt from better-than-expected earnings from  Zoom Video Communications  Inc (NASDAQ:ZM) earlier this week.
The software maker is preparing to report earnings on Thursday. Expectations are for per-share profit of 8 cents on revenue of $318 million.
2. Chipmaker Broadcom seen benefiting from cloud, 5G network trends
Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO)also reports on Thursday. Chipmakers have benefited from a trend toward cloud computing and the anticipation of 5G network technology. That should help lift Broadcom's results above even lofty expectations.
The outlook, according to analysts tracked by Investing.com, is for profit of $5.24 on revenue of $5.7 billion.
3. More data on the state of the job market and service economy
The Federal Reserve said Wednesday that continued uncertainty and volatility last month related to the pandemic and its effects on consumer spending and business activity was widespread. A pickup in activity in May and June actually slowed more recently, it said in its periodic Beige Book.
The observations coincide with lower than expected private payrolls data for August. That sets up expectations for Thursday's weekly release of initial and continuing jobless claims, which have been running at elevated levels.
In addition, Thursday marks the release of the latest ISM non-manufacturing index, a measure of business activity in hard-hit sectors of the service economy.

415,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 02, 2020 03:18PM ET</span>",Two Giant Growth Funds Suffer Biggest Selling Stampede on Record,"(Bloomberg) -- After this year’s surge in high-growth stocks, two big exchange-traded funds tracking those companies are losing steam.
Both the $65 billion Vanguard Growth ETF (VUG) and the $10 billion iShares Core S&P U.S. Growth ETF (IUSG) posted their largest outflows on record last month, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Funds focused on growth lost more than $2.4 billion in August, the most since 2016. Meanwhile, value ETFs attracted $1.9 billion -- their best month since March.
High-growth companies such as megacap technology names with solid balance sheets have been among this year’s hottest trades. But their historic rally has fueled some skepticism about further gains amid concern that they may be too expensive relative to so-called value stocks.
“There’s hesitation that the significant outperformance led by a handful of megacap names like Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) can continue to climb much higher,” said Todd Rosenbluth, head of ETF and mutual fund research at CFRA Research.
Yet signs of a slow economic recovery from the pandemic-induced recession and a spike in global coronavirus cases may still make a compelling case for growth shares. Those companies beat expectations by a stronger margin and more frequently than their value counterparts in the second-quarter earnings season.
Despite the monthly outflows for the sector, the performance ratio of the iShares Russell 1000 Growth ETF (IWF) hit new highs relative to its value counterpart (IWD), according to a recent report from Bloomberg Intelligence.
To Athanasios Psarofagis, an ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, there’s reason to believe that investors could still be favoring growth, but through more targeted approaches.
“For sure, growth ETFs will be heavy on tech, but there is also a lot of other stuff, and I just think people only want tech,” said Psarofagis.
Technology ETFs lured $2.1 billion in August, while thematic sector products received $3.2 billion -- their best month since 2018. The $143 billion Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 (QQQ), which tracks the Nasdaq 100 Index, added $2.1 billion last month. Meanwhile, the Ark Innovation ETF (ARKK), whose biggest holding is Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc., recently had its largest inflow on record.

Investing.com – The Dow jumped on Wednesday, as defensive concerns of the market like utilities and consumer staples got a chance to shine amid data showing the U.S. economy created fewer than expected private jobs last month.  
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.08%, or 308 points, the S&P 500 added 1.17%, and  the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.74%.
In a sign that investors could be worried that the run-up in growth stocks like tech is nearing a top, utilities were among the biggest gainers, led by a more than 3% jump in Exelon (NASDAQ:EXC) and PPL (NYSE:PPL).
Consumer staples were not far behind thanks to a more than 4% rise in Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) and 9% jump in whiskey maker Brown Forman (NYSE:BFb).

(Reuters) - Billionaire investor William Ackman has approached short-term home rental company Airbnb Inc about going public through a reverse merger with his blank-check company, according to people familiar with the matter. 
The discussions are currently not moving ahead and Airbnb is prioritizing going public through a traditional initial public offering this year in what would be one of 2020's most high-profile stock market debuts, the sources said.
Representatives for Airbnb and Ackman declined to comment.
Airbnb said last month it had filed confidentially for an IPO with U.S. regulators.
The approach by Ackman's  Pershing Square Tontine Holdings  Ltd (N:PSTH_u) underscores the scale and ambition of the types of deals Ackman is pursuing with the new vehicle, which raised $4 billion through an IPO on the New York Stock Exchange earlier this year to buy a private company. 
A blank-check company, or special purpose acquisition company (SPAC), is a shell company that raises money through an IPO to buy an operating company, typically within two years.
A deal for Airbnb at the company's roughly $18 billion valuation in a debt deal earlier this year would be the largest SPAC transaction ever. 
Bloomberg News earlier reported on the talks. 
Merging with a SPAC has emerged in recent months as an increasingly popular alternative to an IPO. The likes of sports betting platform DraftKings (NASDAQ:DKNG) Inc and electric vehicle maker Nikola Corp have gone public this year through reverse mergers with SPACs.
A SPAC can be a quicker route to the public market. In a SPAC merger, the company going public can also share detailed earnings forecasts with investors publicly, which is not done in an IPO. 
Ackman and his team ""are in discussions with a number of potential companies that are owned and/or controlled by private equity firms, families, start-up company founders, as well as other private companies,"" the manager wrote in a letter to investors last week. 

Through the end of August, Ackman's Pershing Square Holdings portfolio returned 46%.

418,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 02, 2020 02:25PM ET</span>",Calculating the 'greenium'? Germany may have an answer,"By Yoruk Bahceli
AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Germany's debut green bond may finally provide an answer to the question that's been at the heart of the sustainable investing spree -- how much of a premium must investors pay to get hold of green securities?
The euro zone's largest economy raised 6.5 billion euros on Wednesday from the sale of its first 'green' bonds, a 10-year note, with proceeds earmarked for environmentally beneficial projects.
But what investors were waiting for was the price.
The deal launched with a -0.463% yield, which lead managers said meant a one basis point premium compared to a conventional equivalent. That difference represents what investors often call a ""greenium"" -- the price tag for a green issue.
Germany's green debt plan differs from peers such as France and the Netherlands in that each green bond sold will be matched with a conventional twin. Wednesday's deal for instance is twinned with a conventional issue sold in June .
And whenever an existing green bond is tapped, its twin will be upsized by the same amount.
The structure will show investors the exact cost of going green. Until now, gauging the green premium meant examining an issuer's regular yield curve to gauge where a hypothetical conventional bond identical to the green bond in question might trade.
""For the first time, we will be able to exactly see what the (green) premium looks like without having to do any maths, except for a simple 'minus' calculation, one yield minus the other,"" said Christoph Rieger, head of rates and credit research at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) in Frankfurt.
Green bonds usually trade with a lower yield than comparable conventional bonds, as dedicated funds chase a limited amount of bonds available, so investors have to pay a premium to buy them. It's an important consideration, given pressure on funds to invest sustainably and expectations of huge future growth in the still-tiny green debt market.
For a graphic on Green bonds tend to carry price premium:
https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/azgvonzelpd/Gyp1G-green-bonds-tend-to-carry-a-price-premium-nbsp-.png
And all else equal, they offer issuers more attractive borrowing costs.
The premium implies Germany will save around 6 million euros over the lifetime of the bond, Mizuho analyst Peter McCallum calculates.
Johann Ple, portfolio manager at AXA Investment Managers, which runs 815 billion euros, says factors such as supply-demand balance, liquidity, maturity and coupon differences generally conflate comparisons between green and conventional bonds.
""In this case two similar bonds will help to clarify the ""greenium""... as it will narrow the sources of differences and potentially justify that green bonds offer additional transparency and environmental benefits at no additional cost,"" he said
Some of the price premium on green bonds is due to their scarcity; German green issuance for instance could reach 11 billion euros this year, while total debt sales should amount to around 270 billion euros.
But accurately gauging relative issuance costs should convince more borrowers of the financial benefits of going green, said Piet Christiansen, chief strategist at Danske Bank in Copenhagen.
Just over $750 billion euros worth of green bonds have been issued since 2007, according to the Climate Bonds Initiative, dwarfed by the $100 trillion outstanding on global bond markets.
But issuance is likely to increase steeply soon, as a third of the debt backing the European Union's 750 billion euro recovery fund could be backed by green bonds, potentially almost doubling the global green bond market.
For a graphic on Green bonds make up just 3.7% of global bond issuance:
https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/qzjvqwqegvx/greenbondsEU2107PNG.PNG
So Germany's structuring of this issue could well be key in drawing more borrowers to the green market.
""When Germany will (create) a green curve, then this is what we will price the green projects off of. So it is really that there will be a benchmark of where green pricing will be, going forward,"" Danske's Christiansen said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. passenger railroad Amtrak will furlough more than 2,000 workers as a result of the steep decline in travel demand from the coronavirus pandemic.
Amtrak said in a statement that despite other cuts, ""significant reductions remain necessary due to the slow recovery of ridership and revenue. Approximately 1,950 agreement team members will be furloughed"" and 100 management jobs will be cut in the coming weeks.
In May, Amtrak said it needed a new $1.475 billion bailout and disclosed plans to cut its workforce by up to 20% in the coming budget year.
The company, which has been hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic, received $1 billion in emergency funding from Congress in April. Amtrak, a government-owned corporation that gets annual subsidies from Congress, has said previously it employs about 20,000 workers.
Ridership and revenue levels are down 95% year over year since the pandemic began, Amtrak has said.
U.S. House of Representatives Transportation Committee Chairman Peter DeFazio said the committee's panel overseeing rail issues would hold a hearing on Sept. 9 with Amtrak Chief Executive Bill Flynn.
""It’s time for Republicans in the Senate to stop sitting on these important bills and do their job to protect Amtrak employees and so many others currently in need,"" DeFazio, a Democrat, said.
Much of the U.S. transportation sector has been battered by COVID-19.
Transit agencies are urging Congress to approve $32 billion to $36 billion on top of a $25 billion bailout approved by Congress in March. Urban transit systems have been devastated by millions of workers staying home rather than commuting and a sharp decline in tourism.
Private U.S. bus companies are seeking $15 billion in government assistance.
U.S. airports want another $10 billion in government assistance on top of an earlier $10 billion bailout, while passenger airlines want a further $25 billion in payroll assistance.

United Airlines (O:UAL) said on Wednesday it planned to cut 16,370 jobs as early as Oct. 1 without new government assistance.

The director of the Cannes festival, the world's biggest, and his counterparts for the Berlin, Rotterdam, San Sebastian, Locarno, Karlovy Vary and London film festivals made the trip to Venice for the first such international event to take place since the health crisis all but shut down the movie world.
""It's not for us, everything that we're doing and are trying to do... It's for the work, it's for the films, it's for the directors,"" said Cannes chief Thierry Fremaux, whose own festival could not go ahead as planned earlier this year. 
""During our conversation in March, all of us, felt the great solitude of the artists, who also wondered what would happen. So much filming stopped, lots of releases were cancelled and the very idea that the festival could go on, while cinemas were closed ... did them some good.""
Australian actress Cate Blanchett, who heads the prize-awarding jury in Venice this year, said she also wanted to show support for film-makers who had to complete their movies in challenging circumstances.
""It's so great that there's so many heads of festivals all over the world coming to support Venice and realising that, in fact, it's ... supporting various different facets of the same industry,"" she said.
""I think it feels very collegiate, actually, in a way that maybe it hasn't before. Less territorial.""
Film festivals are often in informal competition to show the most hotly-anticipated new releases. 
Blanchett and Venice director Alberto Barbera highlighted the growth of streaming platforms during months of lockdown and the negative effect this could have on cinemas.
""Today we risk going towards a progressive reduction of the role of movie theatres,"" said Barbera.
With coronavirus cases rising again in Italy and elsewhere, a strict safety protocol has been put in place, including the wearing of face masks while watching films. 

There are 18 titles competing for this year's Golden Lion award for best film - fewer than usual. The top prize is due to be handed out when the festival ends on September 12.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened at fresh all-time highs on Wednesday, extending a rally built on hopes for more monetary stimulus from the Federal Reserve, and shrugging off disappointing labor market numbers.
Stocks continued their ascent at midday. By 12:25 PM ET (1645 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 240 points, or 0.8%. The S&P 500 was also up 0.8%, and the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.1%. The latter two had both closed at record highs on Tuesday.
Earlier, payrolls processor ADP had reported that private-sector employment only rose by 428,000 in the month to mid-August, well below expectations for a number anywhere between 950,000 and 1.2 million. The numbers are the latest sign that the recovery is flattening out after an initial sharp rebound from the lows of the second quarter.
However, the market was in ""good news is good news and bad news is good news"" mode again, as the data reinforced expectations of more stimulus from the Federal Reserve. Governor Lael Brainard had said late on Tuesday that the central bank will have to do more in order to meet its - now revised - target for inflation.
Traders even managed to put a positive spin on the continued deadlock over the next round of fiscal support measures, as Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi renewed contact after a two-week break for party conventions. Mnuchin rejected a trimmed-down $2.2 trillion proposal from Pelosi, while the Speaker said there were still ""serious differences"" between the two sides, which seem content to carry on trying to blame each other for the lack of breakthrough. 
Both Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock were down, taking a breather from the indiscriminate buying that followed their stock splits at the end of last week.  Tesla was down 7%, while Apple was down 2.5%. Also hit by profit-taking was  Zoom Video Communications  (NASDAQ:ZM) stock, which fell 7% after rising over 25% in response to an exceptionally strong quarterly report on Monday evening.
Standout gainers included DraftKings  (NASDAQ:DKNG) stock, which rose 8% before giving back some of the gain, after the sports betting company said basketball legend Michael Jordan had taken an equity stake in the company and would join its board as an advisor. 
Likewise AMC Entertainment  (NYSE:AMC)t stock rose 10% after the movie theater operator said it will reopen 140 cinemas this week.

Premium bourbon sales grew 18% at Brown Forman (NYSE:BFb), helping the company beat sales estimates for the pandemic-constrained fiscal first quarter. 
Shares of the booze maker rose 11% on the news. 
The award-winning Woodford Reserve's revenue jumped 14%. A fifth of the whiskey sells for $28.98 at Walmart (NYSE:WMT) versus Jack Daniel's -- also a Brown Forman brand -- which is going for $14.98.
Tequila sales also saw a nice bump, up 16% thanks to New Mix -- a canned beverage -- sales in Mexico and bottles of el Jimador. 
Investment in advertising at Brown Forman declined 34% for the quarter because Covid-19 provided plenty of free press. Canceled consumer events and sponsorships also helped save money. 
""We believe that we continue to be in a strong financial position and that our capacity to generate solid operating cash flows remain sound, allowing us to navigate this pandemic as circumstances evolve,” said Chief Financial Officer Jane Morreau. The company maintains expectations to fully fund ongoing investments and pay regular dividends.

(Reuters) -  Wells Fargo  & Co (N:WFC) agreed to pay $2.12 million in fines and restitution to settle U.S. regulatory charges its brokers failed to properly account for the costs of switching customers who owned variable annuities to new investments.
The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) said Wells Fargo failed to supervise the suitability of recommendations that customers sell variable annuities carrying ""surrender"" fees, and use proceeds to buy mutual funds and unit investment trusts carrying upfront sales charges.
FINRA said the cost of switching could more than offset the higher returns available on the new investments, leaving customers with less income than if they had stayed put.
It said it identified at least 101 potentially unsuitable switches, including a customer who incurred $14,037 in fees and charges when surrendering a $180,500 annuity.
The payout by Wells Fargo Clearing Services and Wells Fargo Advisors Financial Network includes $1.45 million in restitution and $675,000 in civil fines.
Neither entity admitted or denied wrongdoing. Both have taken steps to improve supervision, including developing a ""switch alert"" for when customers move money.

FINRA said the wrongdoing occurred from January 2011 to August 2016, the month before Wells Fargo became enmeshed in a series of scandals over its treatment of customers, including the opening of accounts without their knowledge.

(Reuters) - Macy's Inc (N:M) will drastically change how it does business this holiday season, executives said on Wednesday, placing a sharper focus on online sales and promoting more beauty and home items to shoppers opting to stay home due to the COVID-19 health crisis.
Shares of the largest U.S. department store operator rose as much as 11% after it reported a smaller-than-expected quarterly loss and beat sales estimates as shoppers bought more activewear, shoes and handbags on its app and website during the pandemic. They were up about 4% in late morning trading.
""Our immediate priority is successfully executing Holiday 2020,"" Chief Executive Officer Jeff Gennette said.
The holiday season accounts for a huge chunk of annual sales for retailers. This year, retailers are rolling out their earliest-ever holiday deals and promotions.
Gennette said nearly half of the company's total gift assortment will be new, led by items in beauty and home, with products at every price point.
Macy's will also reimagine iconic events including the Thanksgiving Day Parade, local tree lightings and holiday window displays, the company said.
Recently announced holiday surcharges will lead to higher delivery expenses that will weigh on the holiday quarter, the company said. 
To cope with the closure of malls and stores due to coronavirus-related lockdowns, Macy's has focused on its online business, giving shoppers the option to buy online and pick up purchases from stores.
Though Macy's sold more merchandise online, with digital sales surging 53% for the second quarter ended Aug. 1, it was not enough to make up for lost in-person sales.
Macy's, along with its department store rivals, depends heavily on tourists - particularly those traveling from overseas - to drive sales, especially at stores like its flagship Herald Square location in New York City.
""Macy's second quarter may have exceeded consensus estimates, but the bar was set so low you could step over it,"" said Craig Johnson, president at retail consultancy Customer Growth Partners. ""The challenge is to size the going-forward company commensurately with demand, trimming the fleet even further, so that store productivity can be rebuilt.""
The company said it will open a number of smaller-format Macy's stores away from malls over the next two years. That comes as the retailer moves to shut hundreds of underperforming stores due to lack of mall traffic. The retailer said it would also test smaller Bloomingdale's standalone stores.
Net sales fell 35.8% to $3.56 billion, but beat analysts' estimates of $3.48 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. 
On an adjusted basis, the company lost 81 cents per share, compared with estimates of a loss of $1.77 per share.
Net loss for the quarter was $431 million, or $1.39 per share, compared with a profit of $86 million, or 28 cents per share, a year earlier.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -  Oracle Corp  (NYSE:ORCL)'s long-running legal challenge to how the Pentagon set up its $10 billion JEDI cloud computing contract has been rejected by a U.S. appeals court.
At the heart of Oracle's dispute was whether the Pentagon should turn to a single company for its cloud computing services. 
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit upheld a lower court ruling that Oracle wasn't harmed by any errors the Pentagon made in developing the contract because it wouldn't have qualified for the contract in the first place.
""Notwithstanding the extensive array of claims raised by Oracle, we find no reversible error in the Claims Court's decision,"" Circuit Judge William Bryson noted in his ruling.
In October, the Defense Department awarded the contract to  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) over market leader Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), which was long considered to be the favorite to win the award. 
Amazon has alleged it lost out because of ""improper pressure"" and bias from President Donald Trump, a frequent critic of Amazon and its CEO Jeff Bezos, who also owns the Washington Post newspaper. 
The contracting process had also long been mired in conflict of interest allegations. 
The Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure Cloud (JEDI) contract is part of a broader digital modernization of the Pentagon aimed at making it more technologically agile.
Oracle and the Pentagon did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The ruling is a win for the Pentagon, which has been criticized for its decision to award such a high-profile contract to one vendor. 

It faces a separate lawsuit by Amazon over claims the Pentagon failed to fairly judge its bid after Trump launched ""repeated public and behind-the-scenes attacks to steer"" the JEDI cloud contract away from the company.

The automaker is offering its white-collar workers buyouts to try to achieve staff cuts of 1,400 positions as part of a global overhaul designed to make the company more competitive and profitable. Ford expects its first full-year loss in a decade this year.
“We’re in a multi-year process of making Ford more fit and effective,” Kumar Galhotra, Ford’s president of the Americas and international markets, said in a memo Wednesday to some 30,000 salaried workers in the U.S. “Our hope is to reach fitness targets with the voluntary incentive program. If that doesn’t happen, involuntary separations may be required.”
Ford cut 7,000 salaried positions worldwide last year in the first round of its multi-year makeover, including 2,300 in the U.S. The carmaker said it expected the move will save $600 million a year. It had a worldwide workforce of 190,000 at the end of 2019.
Ford’s latest retrenchment comes as Jim Farley prepares to take over as chief executive officer on Oct. 1 from current CEO Jim Hackett. Farley has promised to “swing for the fences” to return Ford’s North American region to a 10% profit margin.
Ford hasn’t released financial details of the latest buyouts, but it said it is offering them to U.S. salaried workers with 30 years of service, or who are 55 or older with at least 10 years and those 65 or older with at least five years on the job.

436,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 02, 2020 10:55AM ET</span>",Exclusive: EU draft plan targets free carbon credit cut for most industries,"By Kate Abnett
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Most industries covered by the European Union's carbon market would see free credits cut by the highest possible rate over the next five years under draft plans, potentially costing some of the biggest polluters millions of euros.
The carbon market is the EU's main policy for cutting greenhouse gas emissions, by forcing power plants and factories to buy credits to cover their emissions. 
These credits are trading near record highs as speculators have bought into the idea that tougher EU climate targets will boost demand, while analysts predict further rises.
Although industry gets some free credits, to help avoid ""carbon leakage"", when companies relocate outside the EU to avoid carbon costs, the bloc has agreed to reduce them over the next decade to curb pollution and meet climate goals.
EU industry emitted around 570 million tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2) equivalent under the carbon market regime last year. Buying enough credits to cover those emissions would cost roughly 16 billion euros at today's EU carbon price.
Of 52 industrial products deemed to be at risk of ""carbon leakage"", 43 will face the maximum possible reduction in the benchmark which determines their free credits over the next five years, a European Commission draft seen by Reuters shows.
Those sectors would receive 24% fewer free credits on average over the period 2021-2025, per tonne of product produced, compared with the amount they would currently get. 
Industries whose free credit benchmarks would be cut at the maximum rate include producers of refinery products, coke, iron casting, lime, ammonia, and pulp and paper products.
Other sectors would face smaller curbs. Free credits for primary aluminium and hot metal used in steelmaking would be cut by 3% over 2021-2025, the minimum possible reduction rate.
The draft numbers are subject to change before the Commission publishes the final list by the end of the year. 
The Commission said it does not comment on drafts.
Carbon credit handouts are determined using the Commission's benchmarks and historical production data. The draft document outlines for the first time the Commission's estimates of the new benchmarks, based on data collected from industry.
    New rules taking effect from 2021 will also ensure free credits are more closely tied to production levels, allowing the EU to further adjust handouts if industrial output drops or increases by more than 15% compared with the previous two years.
Such an adjustment could be triggered by the dip in economic activity during the coronavirus crisis.
The impact industry makes on the climate faces increased policymaker scrutiny, as the EU attempts to steer sectors towards its ""Green Deal"" goal of net zero emissions by 2050.

The Commission will put forward proposals to apply carbon costs to polluting imports next year, to shield EU firms from being undercut by countries with weaker climate policies.

""As the company takes the next step, it will focus on investing in companies and solutions that have a direct impact towards the Paris Agreement and the UN Sustainable Development Goals,"" Ingka Group said in a statement. 
In the fiscal year through Aug. 2019, emissions shrank for the first time, by 4% to 25 million tonnes CO2 equivalents. 
To reach the 2030 target, emissions need to come down to around 21 million tonnes.
Maeztu said IKEA would be able to tell in a couple of months whether emissions shrank in the fiscal year which ended earlier this week.

The stock has nearly tripled this year as Peloton’s exercise equipment benefitted from stay-at-home routines and as day trader interest picked up. “We continue to like shares into earnings and believe there is significant upside potential to consensus estimates both near and long term,” wrote analyst Doug Anmuth, who also lifted his sales and earnings estimates. He had previously expected the stock to reach $58 by this December, a level it surpassed in July.
Peloton’s “biggest challenge,” Anmuth said, “is keeping up with elevated demand,” as a bike order-to-delivery time takes six to seven weeks on average, even after the company doubled its pace of manufacturing since March.
Shares rose 6.2% to $88.74 as of 7:40 a.m. in New York. The stock has been trading at record highs, and has mostly traded above analyst price targets since late June.
JPMorgan now expects fourth quarter revenue of $593 million, while Bloomberg’s average estimate suggests the company may generate a little over $575 million in the quarter.
The update follows a price target boost from Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) analysts, who assigned a 12-month target of $96 on the stock last week. Consensus estimates for Peloton were “far too low,” the analysts said.
Peloton reports fourth-quarter results on Sept. 10."

443,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 02, 2020 07:51AM ET</span>",Tesla tests the circuits for German energy market push,"By Vera Eckert, Christoph Steitz, Tom Käckenhoff and Edward Taylor
FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Elon Musk appears to be opening a new front in the European battle for electric car supremacy: the power behind the wheel.
Musk's Tesla (O:TSLA) has recently acquired a licence that will enable the carmaker to trade electricity across western Europe and the company has also been surveying customers in Germany about potentially using Tesla electricity in their cars.
Such moves, consultants and energy industry executives say, could set the stage for the company - possibly with one or more partners - to take on established utilities in Germany, Europe’s biggest power market and autos heartland. 
Tesla declined to comment about its energy market plans.
Generating and trading power could help Tesla lower the running costs of its cars at a time rival automakers, including Germany's BMW (DE:BMWG), Audi (DE:NSUG), Porsche (PSCH.UL) and Mercedes (DE:DAIGn), are churning out new electric models. 
It could also step up competition to utilities such as Vattenfall (VATN.UL) and EnBW (DE:EBKG), which are investing in electric mobility services too, but which like peers RWE (DE:RWEG) and E.ON (DE:EONGn) are lumbered with the cost of winding down fossil fuel and nuclear power plants.
Tesla already sells solar panels and the Powerwall battery storage system for homes, but now appears to be looking at selling electricity directly to customers and using the home storage systems to provide services to the grid. 
In June, the company became a member of the Paris-based EPEX Spot power exchange, a platform used to trade much of western Europe's intraday cross-border electricity. 
A month later, it surveyed German customers about their interest in energy services. 
""What would encourage you to switch from your existing energy supplier?"", the survey said, according to a copy seen by Reuters. 
""Would you buy a Tesla photovoltaic system and home storage (Tesla Powerwall) if you could switch to a specially designed Tesla electricity tariff?"", it added.
Tesla also asked potential energy customers whether they would allow the company to control when cars would charge.
This could allow it to coincide charging with cheap electricity rates during off peak hours, consultants and industry executives said.
It could also open the way for Tesla to use power stored by customers to help balance the electricity grid, an increasingly important service in Germany as it becomes ever more dependent on volatile wind and solar power. 
Companies offering similar services in Germany include Shell-owned (L:RDSa) sonnen, virtual power plant operator Next Kraftwerke, and power aggregator Lichtblick.
RENEWABLE ENERGY
Tesla's interest in renewable energy was one of the factors that led it to choose Brandenburg state around Berlin as the site for a new factory, a person familiar with the company's deliberations told Reuters.
In the first half of this year, some 65% of the electricity on the Brandenburg grid was generated from renewable sources, mostly wind. But like other areas in the north of the country, it often wastes energy because Germany's networks are limited in how much green power they can transport over long distances. 
Tesla's Gigafactory 4 in Brandenburg will on its own require 100 megawatts (MW) of power and up to 400 MW if battery cell production is also launched, according to transmission grid operator 50Hertz.
Tesla is a long way from building up enough battery assets to deliver frequency regulation at grid scale, say specialists such as utility Axpo. But the company has made several steps to expand its energy activities in recent months.
In May, it applied for a UK licence to supply power, according to the Telegraph newspaper. It also uses a platform to bring users of its solar and Powerwall battery system into the electricity market in Australia.
""The next and obvious step for Tesla is to get into production, especially of renewable power,"" said consultant Berthold Hannes, who has 30 years of energy advisory experience.
""Tesla could use its own locations, for example the roofs of plants or the sites of charging points, and alternatively, or in addition, it could take stakes in solar plants or wind parks,"" he said.
Germany pioneered the solar power market, and is in the process of laying a policy framework that will make it easier for decentralised power generation and supply.
""Tesla's long-term plan definitely includes tackling the energy industry in a bigger way, though it's questionable whether it invests enough at the moment in that area,"" said a former member of Tesla management, who declined to be named.

Thomas Deser, a portfolio manager at Union Investment, said it was unlikely Tesla would enter the German electricity distribution business on its own - ""but it could do so with a competent partner from the energy industry.""

444,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 02, 2020 07:45AM ET</span>",India Captured Strategic Posts in Stealth Move Against China,"(Bloomberg) -- India triggered the latest clash with China on their Himalayan border by executing a stealth night-time operation to claim strategic outposts offering a clear view of troop movements in disputed territory, according to Indian officials with knowledge of the matter.
In what they called India’s first offensive move since the conflict began in May, thousands of soldiers climbed up mountain peaks for about six hours to claim the vantage points along the south bank of Pangong Tso -- a glacial lake roughly the size of Singapore. The action was taken to counter what India saw an intrusion by Chinese forces, the officials said, asking not to be identified due to rules on speaking to the media.
The decision to capture high ground that was previously unoccupied along the 3,488 kilometer (2,162 mile) Line of Actual Control revived a conflict that had been largely dormant since June. Back then, India and China’s worst dispute in four decades culminated in the death of 20 Indian soldiers and an unknown number of Chinese soldiers in an ugly battle.
China on Wednesday accused India of breaching agreements between the two sides and unilaterally changing the status quo. An Indian Army spokesman wasn’t immediately available for a comment.
“In China, we have a saying about a guilty man protesting conspicuously his innocence,” Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying told reporters in Beijing. “That’s just what India did.”
Two meetings between senior Indian and Chinese military personnel since the weekend have ended in a deadlock, but commanders from both sides continued to engage each other on Wednesday. While India denied that troops crossed the Line of Control, the move will prevent China from easily monitoring an Indian road that’s crucial for transporting supplies, soldiers and heavy artillery to forward posts along the disputed border.
Both India and China have moved thousands of troops, tanks, artillery guns and fighter jets close to the border since their standoff began in May. But India’s move over the weekend escalated the conflict, said Jayadeva Ranade, a member of the National Security Advisory Board.
“The Indian military move on along the border is defensive but has element of deterrence as well,” said Ranade, who also heads the New Delhi-based think tank China Analysis and Strategy. India is now waiting to see how China reacts, including any moves to counter the deployment that could result in hostilities, he said.
Within China, the appetite for more aggressive moves appears to be growing. A joint survey launched by the Communist Party-run Global Times and the China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations, a research group affiliated with the Ministry of State Security, found more than 70% of the nearly 2,000 people surveyed believed India was being too hostile against China. Nearly 90% supported the government in retaliating strongly against Indian provocations.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi “faces a damaging loss of face” if he doesn’t react strongly to Chinese moves on the border particularly after investing so much political capital in boosting ties with President Xi Jinping, according to Brahma Chellaney, a former adviser to India’s National Security Council and professor of strategic studies at the Centre for Policy Research in New Delhi.
“The latest skirmishes underscore the growing risks of a Himalayan military conflict,” he said."

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are set to open higher Wednesday, continuing the record-breaking positive momentum, with investors buoyed by strong economic data and a stream of encouraging comments from Federal Reserve officials.
At 7:10 AM ET (1110 GMT), S&P 500 Futures traded 22 points, or 0.7%, higher, the Dow Futures contract rose 190 points, or 0.7%, and Nasdaq 100 Futures climbed 120 points, or 1%. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 0.8% higher Tuesday, while the S&P 500 index gained 0.8% and the NASDAQ Composite index climbed 1.4%, both recording new all-time closing highs.
Stocks have soared as investors reacted with optimism to last week’s announcement from the Federal Reserve that the central bank will change its strategy, effectively giving it an easier policy bias for the foreseeable future.. 
Fed Governor Lael Brainard added to this optimism late Tuesday, saying the central bank would need to provide more stimulus to fulfill its promise of stronger job growth and higher inflation.
Additionally, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin spoke Tuesday with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi about stalled coronavirus aid negotiations. Although these talks didn’t result in anything concrete, it may be a good sign that the two sides are communicating again now the presidential conventions are over. 
Economic data have also been reasonably strong of late, with Tuesday showing U.S. manufacturing expanding in July at the fastest pace since 2018.
Wednesday sees the ADP Research Institute’s August jobs report, due at 8:15 AM ET (1215 GMT), ahead of Thursday’s weekly jobless claims and Friday’s official U.S. monthly employment report. The ADP report is expected to show gains of 950,000 non-farm private sector jobs, a hefty jump from 167,000 in July.
This will be followed by factory orders data for July at 10 AM and the Federal Reserve’s Beige Book survey of the U.S. economy at 2 PM.
In corporate news, Macy's (NYSE:M) reported a loss per share of 81 cents, better than expected, on sales of $3.56 billion. Shares of the department store giant are down almost 60% in 2020. 
Specialty discount store Five Below (NASDAQ:FIVE) is set to publish earnings per share of 14 cents on sales of $411.92 million. Shares have fallen 12% this year.
Oil prices posted gains Wednesday, boosted by a larger-than-expected drop in U.S. stockpiles. 
The American Petroleum Institute reported late Tuesday that crude inventories fell by 6.4 million barrels last week to about 501.2 million barrels, when analysts had expected a draw of 1.9 million barrels.
Investors will now look to the Energy Information Administration’s release later in the session to see if it paints a similar picture.
U.S. crude futures traded 0.6% higher at $43.00 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract rose 0.6% to $45.85. 
Elsewhere, gold futures fell 0.4% to $1,971.90/oz. EUR/USD traded 0.4% lower at 1.1864."

LONDON/MILAN (Reuters) - Surging technology stocks are increasing their influence over European stock markets, with  Prosus  (AS:PRX) poised to snatch a key spot in the continent's leading index.
Prosus, one of the world's largest technology investors, will make its debut on the Euro STOXX 50 (STOXX50E) on September 21 as part of a reshuffle of the index, index provider STOXX announced on Tuesday. Prosus owns nearly a third of China's Tencent (HK:0700).
Europe's Tech index (SX8P) is up over 14% so far in 2020 while the broader pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) is down more than 10%, hit hard by the economic downturn triggered by the lockdowns to fight the coronavirus pandemic across the continent. Tech stocks have led European and U.S. bourses throughout the COVID-19 crisis.
Inclusion into an index can help companies bring extra investors on board. Equita analyst Gianmarco Bonacina estimates that Prosus could benefit from up to 2 billion euros ($2.4 billion) in passive fund flows through its promotion to the top 50 stocks index.
While tech stocks have risen in influence, Europe's once dominant banking industry has gradually shrunk over the last decade. France's  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) and Spain's BBVA (MC:BBVA) are being demoted from the benchmark.
The weight of the banking sector in the region's benchmark STOXX 600 index (STOXX) is just 6%, according to Refinitiv, down from more than a fifth in 2006. The tech sector meanwhile broke above 7%, its highest since the dotcom bubble. 
""A significant driver of European equity underperformance over the last decade has been its sector mix, with the region's stock market skewed away from Technology and towards more 'legacy' industries where the underlying growth trends are more muted,""  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) wrote in an equity strategy note.
The telecom sector (SX7P), which enjoyed a golden age at the turn of the millennium, is losing two spots with French and Spanish groups Orange (PA:ORAN) and  Telefonica  (MC:TEF) set to be demoted. 
The other stock making its exit from the EURO STOXX 50 is Germany-based healthcare group Fresenius (DE:FREG). 
Among other companies joining Europe's elite are Dutch payment processor  Adyen  (AS:ADYEN), German residential real estate company Vonovia (DE:VNAn), French wine and spirits group  Pernod Ricard  (PA:PERP) and elevator maker Kone (HE:KNEBV).

447,By Investing.com,"<span>Sep 02, 2020 06:47AM ET</span>","Top 5 Things to Know in the Market on Wednesday, September 2nd","By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- ADP gives a foretaste of Friday's jobs report, while more Fed speakers get to talk about the central bank's strategy shift. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin rejects the latest Democratic proposal economic stimulus. The ECB starts to fret about the euro exchange rate. Australia's run of 30 years without a recession ends and oil prices are well bid in advance of the government's inventory data. Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Wednesday, September 2nd.
1. ADP's taster for August jobs report
The U.S. economy is center stage again as payrolls processor ADP publishes its estimate for the number of private-sector jobs created in August.
Consensus forecasts are for an increase of 957,000, a strong acceleration from 167,000 in July, thanks to the fading of the second wave of Covid-19 cases across the south and west of the country. However, that would still leave the economy some 12 million jobs shy of its pre-Covid level, with barely two months to go to the election.
The ADP numbers are due at 8:15 AM ET (1215 GMT). They’ll be followed by factory orders data for July at 10 AM and the Federal Reserve’s Beige book survey of the U.S. economy at 2 PM.
2. Mnuchin knock back Pelosi's stimulus gambit
Three more speakers from the Federal Reserve get to say their peace on the U.S. economy, with NY Fed President John Williams (NYSE:WMB) due at 10 AM ET, Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester due at 12 PM  and the Minnesota Fed’s Neal Kashkari due at 2 PM.
Markets will watch closely for any reaction to the continued failure of politicians to break the deadlock over the next round of economic support measures for the U.S. economy.
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin last night rejected a pared-down $2.2 trillion proposal from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who said “serious differences” remain between the two sides.
The Centers for Disease Control moved to neutralize one of the biggest risks to consumer confidence on Tuesday, issuing a nationwide order temporarily halting millions of U.S. renters from being evicted, saying evictions would hasten the spread of Covid-19.
3. Stocks set to open higher
U.S. stocks are set to open higher again, supported by the fact that at least politicians are talking again about a fresh stimulus package. Signs from prediction markets that Donald Trump’s chances of  re-election are improving also appear to be supporting sentiment.
By 6:30 AM ET (1030 GMT), the Dow 30 futures contract was up 188 points or 0.7%, while the S&P 500 futures contract was up in parallel. Nasdaq 100 futures were up another 1.0%, amid reports of price action being increasingly driven by relatively small-scale action in the options markets by retail traders.
Of note to investors in distressed stocks – Macy’s is due to report earnings before the open. A net loss of $1.80 a share is expected. AT&T may also garner interest after The Wall Street Journal reported that it’s looking at selling its Xandr digital ad business, only days after a similar report saying that its DirecTV unit may also be on the block.
4. Australia runs out of luck; ECB frets about the euro
Australia – ‘The Lucky Country’ – finally ran out of luck in the second quarter of 2020, confirming its first recession in over 30 years.
The country’s economy shrank by 7.0% in the three months through June as Chinese demand for its commodities – notably iron ore and coal to feed its steel mills – collapsed. Australia has ridden a wave of rising Chinese commodity demand for three decades.
The slowdown hasn’t stopped the Australian dollar rising, however. It’s up 29% from its March low against the greenback and fell only 0.4% on the data to leave it close to a two-year high.
European data overnight also tended to the negative side: Spanish unemployment rose by nearly 30,000 in August, instead of the 10,000 expected, while German retail sales fell for the second month in a row in July. The euro gave up over a cent against the dollar, with comments from ECB Chief Economist Philip Lane helping to reinforce a bit of overdue profit-taking.
5. Inventories keep oil well supported
The U.S. government will release its weekly estimate of U.S. oil supplies, a day after the American Petroleum Institute suggested that last week saw another sharp drop in crude stocks.
Crude stocks are estimated to have fallen 1.89 million barrels last week while gasoline stocks are expected to have dropped by 3.04 million, with retailers having to draw down stocks to replace supplies from refineries that closed during the onset of Hurricane Laura.
The API on Tuesday had estimated a draw of 6.36 million barrels of crude, something that kept both U.S. futures and Brent well supported.  They were up by 0.3% and 0.2% respectively by 6:30 AM ET."

449,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 02, 2020 06:25AM ET</span>","In change of tack, EU leaves door open to COVID vaccines purchase through WHO","By Francesco Guarascio
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - European Union states could buy potential COVID-19 vaccines through a procurement scheme co-led by the World Health Organization, the EU Commission said in what appears to be a change in position. 
The move could allow EU governments to secure vaccines from companies that are not negotiating with Brussels, such as U.S. firms Merck, Inovio and  Novavax  (NASDAQ:NVAX). They are all in talks with the WHO scheme, dubbed COVAX, but have so far not been reported to be involved in negotiations with the EU Commission.
EU states have committed not to enter into parallel negotiations with the same vaccine manufacturers with which talks are ongoing at EU level, but this ""does not exclude the possibility to take part in negotiations with other vaccine companies through COVAX,"" an EU Commission spokesman said.
That would represent a change of policy after the EU executive had advised the 27 EU governments not to purchase vaccines through the WHO scheme deeming it slow, expensive and legally incompatible with the parallel EU procurement programme, EU officials said in July.
The apparent change came after the WHO softened in August the terms for rich countries to join its scheme, which aims to secure 2 billion doses for the 20% of the world's most vulnerable people by the end of 2021.
It also followed criticism that the EU was effectively undermining the WHO initiative, despite projecting itself as a champion of multilateralism and as a supporter of equitable access to vaccines for all.
By forcing EU states to buy only through an EU scheme, the Commission could reduce the limited amount of doses initially available to less developed countries, because it would prioritise the 450 million EU citizens, effectively replicating nationalist policies of the United States and other countries critical of the WHO initiative.
The EU has so far reached an advance purchase deal on COVID-19 vaccines with AstraZeneca (NYSE:AZN), and has said it is in talks with Johnson & Johnson,  Sanofi  (NASDAQ:SNY),  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) and CureVac. 
EU officials told Reuters in July the bloc was also talking with  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and BionTech for the shot they are developing together.
NOT SO CLEAR
Under a confidential agreement seen by Reuters, EU states have committed not to start negotiations for upfront purchases of vaccines with companies which are already in talks with the EU. 
They are also allowed to conduct parallel talks if they decide to opt-out from deals signed by the EU Commission.
The interpretation that the EU Commission had so far given to this clause was strict. It may have now agreed to a softer stance.
It remains unclear whether EU states will actually buy through COVAX, as this could result in higher costs, a European official involved in talks told Reuters.
When Germany, France, Italy and the Netherlands signed a preliminary deal with AstraZeneca in June over its potential vaccine, many EU governments complained of having been sidetracked, even if they were in theory offered access to doses.
Asked what would happen if the Commission started talks with a vaccine maker after an EU government had already began talks with it through COVAX, an EU Commission spokesman did not comment.
So far the EU Commission has committed 400 million euros ($475 million) in guarantees to COVAX but has also said the terms of its involvement were still under negotiation.
It is also openly saying that it would donate to poorer countries surplus vaccines that it acquires through its scheme, in what seems to replicate COVAX's core function.

450,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 02, 2020 06:20AM ET</span>","Exclusive: Some 1,300 voting forms uncounted in contentious Toshiba AGM - sources","By Makiko Yamazaki and Takashi Umekawa
TOKYO (Reuters) - An internal investigation by Toshiba Corp (T:6502) has found about 1,300 postal voting forms for its annual meeting went uncounted, two people familiar with the matter said, adding to concerns about potential governance breaches at the Japanese conglomerate.
The unusually large number of uncounted votes related to a failed attempt by foreign shareholders to elect some new independent directors to Toshiba's board at the July 31 meeting. 
The votes were uncounted because they apparently arrived late, even though the postmarks indicated they normally would not have missed the deadline, the two sources told Reuters, declining to be identified because the issue is still private.
The revelation comes after Reuters last month reported Singapore-based hedge fund 3D Investment Partners, a major investor in Toshiba, had called for a third-party investigation into the meeting, saying its vote had not been fully recognised.
It is likely to further deepen concerns about the treatment of minority shareholders and what appears to be a retreat from the push for better governance and returns under outgoing Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.
Toshiba, which has not yet informed shareholders whose votes were not counted, said it is conducting investigations with its shareholder registry administrator, Sumitomo Mitsui (NYSE:SMFG) Trust Bank (T:8309). 
""So far, we've been told that vote counting was done properly by our administrator,"" Toshiba said in a statement sent to Reuters. ""We have also asked Japan Post to investigate the mail delivery situation."" 
Sumitomo Mitsui Trust declined to comment on individual cases.
The voting forms in question all had postmarks indicating they were accepted at post offices close to senders on July 27, the people said. 
Most only reached Sumitomo Mitsui Trust's Tokyo office on July 31 or later, which was after the July 30 voting deadline, they said, suggesting it took four days or more for delivery.
Japan Post said all letters, in principle, are delivered within three days on weekdays as the postal law dictates, with more than 90% being delivered within two days. 
""I can't think it took more than four days and we confirmed there was no significant delay caused by COVID-19 at the end of July in Tokyo,"" spokesman Hideo Murata said.
More than 53,000 shareholders voted via mail, online or by proxy at the meeting. How much voting power the uncounted forms represented in total is not clear, or what caused the delay.
Tokyo Metropolitan University Professor Yuichi Ozaki, a corporate law expert, said the situation could be a reason for cancelling the vote results, depending on what caused the delay.
""Investors had probably assumed that their voting rights would have been exercised when they mailed their voting forms in advance to meet the deadline,"" he said. ""If their votes were not counted, it means their expectations were significantly defied.""
PROXY FIGHT
Toshiba saw a closely contested proxy fight in the run-up to the annual meeting with 3D and another overseas investor, Effissimo Capital Management, each nominating several outside directors.
The shareholder proposals, opposed by Toshiba, failed to gain majority support, but one shareholder-backed nominee gained substantial backing with 43% of the vote.
Toshiba CEO Nobuaki Kurumatani saw a precipitous slide in his support to just 58% from 99% a year earlier - a rare rebuke of a Japan Inc chief executive.
Reuters previously reported Effissimo was kept in limbo by Japan's government over a key shareholder vote until the day before the annual meeting.
The activist hedge fund needed approval to vote on its proposal under tighter rules on foreign ownership designed to protect industries critical to national security.

A representative for Effissimo said the fund is not in a position to comment. 3D declined to comment.

Investing.com -- Europe has tried to get through the pandemic without any of its big employers collapse into bankruptcy. It’s now facing a key test of that desire.
 Vallourec  (PA:VLLP) may not be a household name, but it is a big player in one of the sectors hit hardest by Covid-19. Its main business is producing pipes for the oil and gas sector, demand for which has crashed as Big Oil around the world has slashed its investment spending.
The fact that Vallourec’s two big side businesses – pipes for power stations and industrial facilities – are also severely challenged hasn’t helped. Indeed, the company has been in trouble for years, and is a good example of how the Covid-19 pandemic has accelerated trends that were already in motion.
Vallourec had warned at the end of July that there was “significant uncertainty” over its ability to continue business, after failing to persuade shareholders to inject 800 million euros into the struggling business, filling the hole made by a 660 million euro net loss in the first half.
As such, it started talks with its banks about a possible debt restructuring. By the start of this week, it was clear that that wouldn’t be enough. Vallourec said after the close on Monday that it will have to rope its bondholders into restructuring talks.
Vallourec’s chief problem is that 1.7 billion euros of a 1.9 billion bank facility matures in February. It has two bonds under U.S. law that mature in October 2022 and October 2023. The company doesn’t have enough cash on hand to meet the February payment and is unlikely to generate much from operations before that deadline.
It’s now asking the approval of bondholders for the appointment of a ‘mandataire ad hoc’, a negotiator with the power to effect an out-of-court settlement of the company’s debts to prevent it filing for bankruptcy.
President Emmanuel Macron famously promised at the start of the pandemic that no French company would need to declare bankruptcy because of the pandemic. He’s not alone in that – Germany has also relaxed its bankruptcy laws temporarily to the same end.
But Vallourec’s problems have been evident for years. Its shares have been in decline for a decade. It is a prime example of a company whose long-term issues have been magnified and accelerated by the pandemic, but not caused by it.
Investors can learn a lot from how Europe is going to emerge from the pandemic by how actively the French government gets involved in this process.
How far is Paris willing to go to save 19,000 jobs at the company, most of them in France (the North American and German workforces have already been drastically cut back). Will it lean on the banks to save a company that has “Zombie” written all over it? Will it inject equity itself, even though private investors have already refused (thus making any state aid a prima facie breach of EU competition rules)? Or has it shrunk to the point where it can be allowed to fail?
The shares, with a market value of 245 million euros, are already priced for bankruptcy and the breach of Macron’s promise. Any better outcome will be bought at a heavy price in terms of the European economy’s long-term future."

HONG KONG/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Wealth managers in Asia are preparing to lend more to their clients and help them raise cash by selling investments to ensure they can get their hands on shares in Chinese fintech giant Ant Group's up to $30 billion IPO, bankers said.
The region's wealth managers routinely offer loans to major clients for subscribing to initial public offerings (IPOs), but they are going the extra mile to offer access to what could be the world's largest listing because the deals are lucrative and come at a time when the pandemic has hit new business growth.
And getting the desired number of shares allotted on the blockbuster listing could be tricky because the technology sector is fancied by investors, and the bigger the investment in the IPO, the greater the chances of securing allotment, bankers said.
""If it's the world's largest IPO, it becomes mandatory for the wealth managers to try and get their clients on the front seats,"" said a Hong Kong-based senior banker at a European wealth manager that manages more than $200 billion in assets.
""For an offering like this you can only boost your chances of allotment by raising the bid size and that will only happen by increased leverage,"" said the banker, declining to be named as he was not authorised to speak to the media.
Ant, an arm of Chinese e-commerce giant  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group, did not disclose the size, timetable or other key details of the offering in its preliminary prospectus filed last week. But sources have said the dual listing in Shanghai and Hong Kong could raise as much as $30 billion and come as soon as October.
Wealth management firms in Asia including Bank of Singapore,  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN), Julius Baer and UBS already provide loans against securities. They profit from the interest they charge as well as from brokerage fees.
The loan-to-value ratios, or the sum one can borrow against the total value of the underlying asset, at top wealth managers for IPOs in Asia range between 30% and 50% depending on market conditions and company fundamentals. 
In Ant's case, some banks are looking to raise that to as much as 80%, said the people.
And given the low interest rates and a rally in tech stocks, some private banks' have reversed moves introduced earlier this year to cut or even stop single-stock loans as they were deemed a high-risk business in a volatile market, they said.
Some wealth managers are also advising clients in the region to pare or exit their holdings in fixed-income and other under-performing securities to free up liquidity to participate in the Ant IPO, the people said.
""Despite the size of the IPO, demand for tech is huge, so there'll be a scramble for allocations,"" said a Singapore-based wealth manager at a French bank, who also declined to be named as he was not authorised to speak to the media.

""I have told my clients to be patient and look for trades in the secondary market. This is a long-term trade not just an IPO trade.""

Daimler has launched a new S-Class every seven years for decades but this year's launch of its most profitable model is particularly important for the company as it battles the fallout from the pandemic and a costly switch to electric cars.
""The S-Class is an important driver of image and, measured by margin, the largest source of profits,"" says Frank Schwope, an analyst at Norddeutsche Landesbank.
CEO Ola Kaellenius is leading a cost-cutting drive after Daimler reported a 30% slump in second-quarter revenue and a loss before interest and taxation of 1.68 billion euros ($2 billion).
Kaellenius flagged signs of a recovery in demand in July, especially for top-end Mercedes-Benz models and electric vehicles, and analysts have also pointed to a strong rebound in China, the most important market for Mercedes-Benz.
Daimler could sell 95,000 S-Class cars in 2021, which with prices at more than 100,000 euros each could contribute more than 2 billion euros to the company's results, estimates Daniel Schwarz, a car analyst at Bank Mainfirst.
Daimler does not detail profitability of different models, but analysts estimate the margin on the S-Class at 15-20% of sales.
The S-Class should benefit from being the newest premium model on the market as it competes with BMW's (DE:BMWG) 7 Series and Audi's A8 (DE:VOWG_p), which were launched in 2019 and 2017.
Daimler is also due to launch the electric version of the S-Class called the EQS next year, although analysts caution that will not be the same money-spinner for the company.
The S-Class provides some comfort for employees concerned about their jobs due to the pandemic and the switch to electric vehicles - it will be produced at a brand new factory in Sindelfingen in southern Germany, near Daimler headquarters.
The factory cost 730 million euros and more than 1,500 employees will work on an ergonomic assembly line, which Daimler says will be 25% more efficient than its previous location.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - China's Ant Group plans to raise more funds on Shanghai's Nasdaq-style market than in Hong Kong as part of its up to $30 billion dual listing, people with direct knowledge of the matter said, in a major endorsement of the year-old mainland exchange.
The financial technology firm backed by Chinese e-commerce titan  Alibaba  Group (N:BABA) plans to do a simultaneous listing in Hong Kong and Shanghai, in what sources have said could be the world's largest initial public offering and come as soon as October.
Ant, already the world's most valuable unicorn - or billion-dollar unlisted tech firm - did not disclose the size, timetable or other key details of the offering in its preliminary prospectus filed last week.
But sources said that while the specific percentage breakdown between the Hong Kong and Shanghai floats was yet to be finalised, Ant, after initial investor feedback, will likely sell more shares on Shanghai's STAR Market than in Hong Kong. 
The IPO's lead managers have approached many Chinese institutional investors, asking them to invest in the STAR tranche as a strategic investor, potentially committing at least 1 billion yuan to 1.5 billion yuan ($146 million to $220 million) each and accepting a 12-month lock-up on the investment, said one of the people.
Ant declined to comment. The sources declined to be named as they were not authorised to speak to the media. 
The offering would be a boost to STAR's status as a fast-growing capital markets center, at a time when rising Sino-U.S. tensions have triggered concerns about the prospects of listing of Chinese companies in the United States.
China is gradually switching from a tightly controlled IPO system, where every float needs approval, to a more registration-based scheme similar to Western markets, which it piloted by launching Shanghai's tech-focused STAR last year. 
Companies raised $10.3 billion via IPOs on the STAR Market in the first seven months of 2020, making it the second-biggest market globally, behind Nasdaq but ahead of Shanghai's main board and Hong Kong, Refinitiv data showed.
Ant looks to sell between 10% and 15% of its shares. The company said in its filing that it plans to sell at least 10% of its enlarged share capital in the dual-listing, before a 15% greenshoe, or over-allotment, option is exercised.
For the STAR tranche, Ant set a placeholder amount of 48 billion yuan to indicate the size of the float when it filed with the Shanghai Stock Exchange. Companies generally raise more than their initial indication if investor feedback is positive.

""We have the ability to bring forward the deliveries if there is a rebound in air travel,"" Qatar Airways CEO Akbar al-Baker said of the Airbus deal at the CAPA Australia Pacific Aviation Summit, without providing further details. 
Al-Baker said the airline had not reached an agreement with Boeing.

Qatar Airways said in June it would not take any new planes ordered from Boeing or Airbus in 2020 or 2021, adding there would be a knock-on effect to future deliveries due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
The airline has 27 A350-1000s and 50 A321neos on order, according to the Airbus website. It has also ordered 60 777X planes, five 777 freighters and 23 787-9s from Boeing, the U.S. manufacturer's website said.

Investing.com - European stock markets posted strong gains Wednesday, with signs of a global economic recovery overshadowing weak German retail sales.
At 3:45 AM ET (0745 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 1.5% higher, the CAC 40 in France rose 1.4%, while the U.K.'s FTSE index was up 1.7%.
U.S. manufacturing indicators pointed to an expanding sector on Tuesday, with the reading from the Institute for Supply Management hitting its highest level in nearly two years.
Eurozone manufacturing activity also grew last month, despite Spain slipping back into contraction, while Chinese factory data signaled rising global demand for exports, a sign the world economy is recovering from the pandemic.
This broad picture of growth has meant that the market has paid little attention Wednesday to the news that German retail sales fell 0.9% on the month in July, after a revised drop of 1.9% in June.
In corporate news,  Barratt Developments  (LON:BDEV), Britain's biggest housebuilder, climbed 5.9% after it flagged an improvement in forward sales, despite reporting a substantial fall in annual housing completions and revenue.
 Pernod Ricard  (PA:PERP) rose 1.8% despite booking a 1 billion euro impairment for its fiscal year as sales plunged during the pandemic-inspired shutdowns. Helping the stock was its inclusion into the blue chip Euro Stoxx 50 as part of the index’s rebalancing.
Also entering the index were  Prosus  (AS:PRX),  Adyen  (AS:ADYEN), Vonovia (DE:VNAn) and KONE Oyj (HE:KNEBV), with BBVA (MC:BBVA), Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN)  Telefonica (NYSE:TEF), Orange (PA:ORAN) and Fresenius (DE:FREG) making way.
Investors will also be keeping a close eye on the ADP Research Institute’s August jobs report in the U.S., due at 8:15 AM ET (1215 GMT), ahead of Thursday’s weekly jobless claims and Friday’s official U.S. monthly employment report.
The ADP report is expected to show gains of 950,000 non-farm private sector jobs, a hefty jump from 167,000 in July.
Oil prices posted gains Wednesday, boosted by a larger-than-expected drop in U.S. stockpiles. 
The American Petroleum Institute reported late Tuesday that crude inventories fell by 6.4 million barrels last week to about 501.2 million barrels, when analysts had expected a draw of 1.9 million barrels.
Investors will now look to the Energy Information Administration’s release later in the session to see if it paints a similar picture.
U.S. crude futures traded 1% higher at $43.19 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract rose 0.9% to $45.98. 
Elsewhere, gold futures fell 0.5% to $1,968.80/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.3% lower at 1.1875.

COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Sales of Lego jumped 14% in the first six months of the year as families under coronavirus lockdowns spent more time playing together at home, the Danish toy maker said on Wednesday.
Family-owned Lego has returned to growth since 2017, when a decade of double-digit sales increases came to an abrupt halt.
Since then, the company has managed to outpace growth in the overall toy market, a trend that continued between January and June. Best known for its colourful plastic bricks, Lego competes for market share with the likes of Barbie maker Mattel (O:MAT) and Hasbro (O:HAS).
""We saw a very positive development during the coronavirus lockdown when families began playing and building Lego sets together,"" Chief Executive Niels Christiansen said in an interview.
""We've seen momentum continue into the second half of the year even after people started going back to work and to school. So the result is not just a reflection of two months when everyone was sitting at home,"" said Christiansen, who took the helm at Lego in 2017.
Last year, Lego increased investments in e-commerce and its brand website, which saw the number of visitors double to 100 million in the first six months of 2020.
While consumer sales grew 14% in the period, revenue rose by only 7% to 15.7 billion Danish crowns ($2.5 billion). The difference in revenue and consumer sales was due to retailers drawing on existing inventory to meet demand, as Lego was forced to temporary shut production in Mexico and China.
The company was able to more than compensate for all its 616 shops worldwide being closed at some point during the pandemic by increasing online sales. Nearly all shops have now reopened, Lego said.
Operating profit grew 11% to 3.9 billion crowns, Lego said.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Shares in Australia's Afterpay Ltd (AX:APT) and its smaller consumer lender rivals tumbled for a second day on Wednesday, as the entry of U.S. giant PayPal into the buy-now-pay-later (BNPL) sector sent investors scrambling to re-price its frothy stocks.
Afterpay fell as much as 12.4%, before paring losses, and has shed about A$2.5 billion ($1.84 billion) in market value in the two trading sessions since  PayPal Holdings Inc  (O:PYPL) said it would offer small, short-term interest-free loans to U.S. customers.
Rivals also tumbled, with Zip Co Ltd (AX:Z1P) dropping as much as 17.8% and  Sezzle Inc  (AX:SZL) 15.5% before both trimmed losses. They have each shed roughly 20% in two days.  Openpay Group Ltd  (AX:OPY) slid 10% and Splitit Ltd (AX:SPT) fell 4.6%.
The broader market (AXJO) ended 1.8% higher. 
""Having such a large customer base already in the U.S., PayPal certainly throws a spanner in the works for their expansion plans,"" said James Tao, a market analyst at CommSec in Sydney.
These alternative credit firms, which offer small instalment loans to shoppers and make money by charging merchants a commission, are riding an online shopping boom sparked by the coronavirus pandemic.
A near 10-fold rally in Afterpay's share price since March has catapulted the company into Australia's top 20 largest listed firms, even though it has never turned a profit.
The United States is seen as the sector's largest growth market and is a key focus for most of the Australia-listed companies.
PayPal's offering is for purchases between $30 and $600, repayable in four instalments over six weeks and is broadly similar to Afterpay's product.
The companies have sought to reassure investors and downplayed the potential impact of PayPal on their prospects. 
Afterpay co-founder Anthony Eisen said in a statement that competition ""from traditional and newer players"" would not change the company's strategy ""or diminish our global opportunity"".
The chief executives of Zip Co, Sezzle and Splitit, in separate statements, said they were broadly prepared for competition in the sector and that PayPal's entry underscored its relevance and potential.
Openpay's CEO Michael Eidel said ""happy is maybe not exactly the right term but we welcome it,"" adding that the entry will help grow the sector ""into people's minds and into people's wallets and that's good news for us."" 
Michael Smith, director of Kauri Asset Management in Sydney, which owns Afterpay stock, said the sector had already survived last year's entry of  Visa Inc  (N:V) and was well placed.
Kauri has a small allocation in next week's listing of yet another BNPL company, Laybuy Group Holdings Ltd (AX:LBY).
""It's still the hottest sector of our market at the moment and that's probably not going to change any time soon.""

(Reuters) - Proxy advisory firm Glass Lewis said late on Tuesday it had recommended Tesla Inc's (O:TSLA) investors to vote in favor of re-electing Chairwoman Robyn Denholm after having earlier opposed her re-election in June.
Glass Lewis said its recommendation changed due to the satisfactory action taken by Tesla regarding liability insurance for its directors.
Tesla will hold its annual shareholder meeting on Sept. 22.
Glass Lewis said it changed its recommendation due to the move by Tesla's board to replace its earlier liability insurance policy with a 90-day interim arrangement to resume evaluating more traditional options for liability insurance.
In June, Glass Lewis had joined Institutional Shareholder Services Inc (ISS) in opposing the chairwoman's re-election to the board.
The recommendation was based on corporate governance concerns due to an insurance arrangement with Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk, after Tesla's decision to not renew its liability policy for directors and officers over high premiums quoted by insurers.
""We are concerned that this D&O arrangement gives the company's independent directors a direct, personal financial dependency upon the CEO they are tasked with overseeing,"" Glass Lewis had said in its earlier recommendation.
On Tuesday, the proxy adviser said that while Glass Lewis still regarded the revised policy as ""unorthodox and potentially conflicting"", it at least showed that Tesla responded to concerns from shareholders and related parties regarding the earlier policy.
""While we do not believe that recommending shareholder opposition to any director is warranted based solely on this issue at this time, we may recommend holding certain directors accountable should the company ultimately fail to commit to a less problematic D&O arrangement,"" Glass Lewis said.

Denholm, a company director for nearly six years, was named Tesla chairwoman in November 2018 at a time when investors were demanding more robust oversight of Musk's activities and public outbursts.

ZURICH (Reuters) - Switzerland's financial supervisor has opened enforcement proceedings against  Credit Suisse  (S:CSGN) over a spying scandal that led to the ousting of former Chief Executive Tidjane Thiam and tarnished its reputation.
The move by FINMA intensifies the regulatory pressure on Credit Suisse and follows the completion of a review of the bank's corporate governance by an independent auditor and its use of electronic communications in connection with the surveillance of former employees.
FINMA said on Wednesday it will pursue indications of violations of supervisory law and in particular the question of how these activities were documented and controlled.
Credit Suisse said it would cooperate ""to ensure a complete and expeditious conclusion of the review of this episode and incorporate lessons learned.""
The bank had tried to remove the auditor, Thomas Werlen, appointed by FINMA as part of its probe into the bank, because his law firm Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan had been involved in legal cases against it.
Credit Suisse's appeal of a lower court decision that backed Werlen's appointment is pending in the Swiss Federal Supreme Court.
FINMA declined to comment on how Credit Suisse's ongoing appeal and the pending court decision could impact its enforcement proceedings.
Credit Suisse reiterated on Wednesday that spying on employees was not part of its culture.
Revelations of corporate espionage erupted last year when it emerged Credit Suisse had been snooping on former wealth management boss Iqbal Khan, who was leaving for rival UBS (S:UBSG), and former human resources head Peter Goerke. 
An internal Credit Suisse probe concluded that Thiam didn’t know about the spying, and that Chief Operating Officer Pierre-Olivier Bouee was responsible. Bouee, a longtime confidant of Thiam, was fired late last year and has not commented publicly on the scandal.

Thiam resigned in February and Credit Suisse hired Thomas Gottstein, a bank veteran, to replace him.

TOKYO/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Asian shares inched up on Wednesday following buoyant manufacturing indicators from the United States and elsewhere and a rally in U.S. tech shares, with investors also expecting more policy support from Washington.
European stocks are expected to follow Asia's upbeat lead, with pan-European Euro Stoxx 50 futures up 0.64% and German DAX futures up 0.75%. FTSE futures traded 0.86% higher. 
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan gained 0.3% while Japan's Nikkei advanced 0.5%. In China, the bellwether CSI300 index rose 0.2%.
On Wall Street, both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq boasted record closing highs, with the technology sector leading the charge.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), the world's biggest company by market capitalisation, rose just under 4% to take its value to almost $2.3 trillion after a media report that the company had asked suppliers to make at least 75 million 5G iPhones for later this year.
U.S. manufacturing indicators showed expansion, with the reading from the Institute for Supply Management hitting its highest level in nearly two years.
""On top of the strong headline figure, looking at new orders and inventories components in the survey, the manufacturing sector looks unlikely to falter any time soon,"" said Shogo Maekawa, global market strategist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Asset Management.
Euro zone manufacturing activity also grew last month to stay on a path toward recovery, though factory managers remained wary about investing and hiring more workers.
""At the moment the market is seeing a lot of positive momentum,"" said Greg Boutle, U.S. head of equity and derivative strategy at BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY) in New York. ""If you get OK-to-good data and anything from the political landscape that looks like its moving more toward a compromise that's constructive for markets.""
U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Tuesday he would telephone House Speaker Nancy Pelosi about stalled coronavirus aid negotiations later in the day.
White House chief of staff Mark Meadows said Senate Republicans are likely to bring up a targeted COVID-19 relief bill next week.
The U.S. Federal Reserve dabbed in more support for the economy as Governor Lael Brainard said the central bank would need to provide more stimulus to fulfil its promise of stronger job growth and higher inflation.
Brainard's comments helped to push down the 10-year U.S. Treasuries yield to 0.680% from above 0.7%. Last week it rose to as high as 0.789%, the highest in 2-1/2 months.
""We are entering the second stage of central bank-financed government stimulus,"" said Hiroshi Watanabe, senior economist at  Sony  (NYSE:SNE) Financial Holdings. 
""This means U.S. nominal bond interest rates will be kept low and real interest rates will decline. The dollar will continue to fall while boosting various asset prices from gold to stocks."" 
The yield on inflation-protected U.S. Treasuries, or real U.S. yields, remained depressed at minus 1.092%, near a record low of minus 1.111% hit last month.
The strong manufacturing data also helped the U.S. dollar claw back losses a tad for now after it hit a 28-month low against a basket of currencies on Tuesday.
The dollar index stood at 92.381, off Tuesday's low of 91.737.
The euro changed hands at $1.1905, flat on the day after touching above $1.20 for the first time since 2018 during Tuesday's trading.
The dollar was firm on the yen at 106.04 yen.
The Australian dollar lost as much as 0.5% to $0.7338, after GDP data showed the Australian economy suffered a deeper-than-expected 7% contraction in the last quarter, its worst economic downturn on record and confirming its first recession in about three decades.

Investing.com - European stock markets are set to open higher Wednesday, boosted by signs of a global economic recovery, although gains are likely to be limited ahead of key U.S. employment data.
At 2:05 AM ET (0605 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.6% higher, CAC 40 futures in France climbed 0.7%, while the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. rose 0.8%. 
U.S. manufacturing indicators pointed to an expanding sector on Tuesday, with the reading from the Institute for Supply Management hitting its highest level in nearly two years.
Eurozone manufacturing activity also grew last month, despite Spain slipping back into contraction, while Chinese factory data signaled rising global demand for exports, a sign the world economy is recovering from the pandemic.
Meanwhile, the U.S. Federal Reserve has indicated that its accommodative policies will remain in place for some time. Fed Governor Lael Brainard said late Tuesday the central bank would need to provide more stimulus to fulfil its promise of stronger job growth and higher inflation.
With this in mind, investors will be keeping a close eye on the ADP Research Institute’s August jobs report, due at 8:15 AM ET (1215 GMT), ahead of Thursday’s weekly jobless claims and Friday’s official U.S. monthly employment report.
The ADP report is expected to show gains of 950,000 non-farm private sector jobs, a hefty jump from 167,000 in July.
Turning back to Europe, German retail sales provided a negative surprise, falling 0.9% on the month in July, and June's data were also revised downward. 
In corporate news, Unilever (NYSE:UL) said Wednesday it would invest 1 billion euros to eliminate fossil fuels from its cleaning products by 2030.
The banking sector was also in focus, after the Swiss financial supervisor said it has opened enforcement proceedings against  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) over a 2019 spying affair, in which it hired investigators to track a departing manager. The Danish financial watchdog was also launching a probe into  Danske Bank  (CSE:DANSKE) over its handling of debt collection errors. 
Oil prices posted gains Wednesday, boosted by a larger-than-expected drop in U.S. crude stockpiles and signs of recovery in the manufacturing bases of both the U.S. and China, the two largest economies in the world.
U.S. crude inventories fell by 6.4 million barrels last week to about 501.2 million barrels, the American Petroleum Institute said. Analysts had expected a draw of 1.9 million barrels.
Investors will now look to the Energy Information Administration’s release later in the session to see if it paints the same picture.
U.S. crude futures traded 0.9% higher at $43.16 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract rose 0.9% to $45.98. 
Elsewhere, gold futures fell 0.4% to $1,970.70/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% lower at 1.1905."

NEW DELHI/MUMBAI (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) has added insurance and even gold to its menu of financial services in India, to expand its customer base and attract more subscribers to its Prime loyalty programme in a battleground growth market.
The push ramps up competition as financial technology (fin-tech) rivals and their deep-pocketed foreign backers struggle for profitability in a predominantly cash-based economy where about 190 million adults do not have bank accounts.
To boost online payments, Amazon launched its Amazon Pay digital wallet in 2016. It has since introduced a credit card, signed up to a state-backed payments network, and processes payments for movie and flight tickets as well as telephone and utility bills.
It began offering auto insurance in July and gold investment products in August - both a first for Amazon.
Its U.S. fin-tech efforts have been modest by comparison, stymied in part by merchant reluctance to use services offered by their biggest retail rival.
In India, however, where it has over 100 million registered users, Amazon is better placed to use financial services to win subscribers to its annual $13 Prime plan which offers faster shipping and music and video streaming, tech executives said.
To that end, the company aspires to make Amazon Pay the country's payment method of choice, said Mahendra Nerurkar, head of Amazon Pay in India, which has signed up 4 million merchants.
""Apparently Chinese fashion designers are leaving the back pockets off jeans because no one uses them anymore (for wallets),"" Nerurkar told Reuters. ""We would love to make that happen in India.""
India's digital payment market is set to more than double in value to $135 billion by 2023 from 2019, showed a study by professional services firm PwC and Indian lobby group ASSOCHAM.
THIN-MARGIN BUSINESS
A ban on high-value currency notes in late 2016 amplified a digital payment drive in India, with Amazon joined in the sphere by Alphabet Inc's (O:GOOGL) Google, Walmart Inc's (N:WMT) PhonePe, and Paytm, backed by SoftBank Group Corp (T:9984).
Later prospective entrants have faced tougher regulatory scrutiny.  Facebook Inc 's (O:FB) WhatsApp, which boasts over 400 million users in India, has been awaiting approval to offer payment services for over two years as regulators wrestle with new data-localisation rules.
Yet for incumbents, profit has been elusive. Paytm, also backed by  Alibaba  Group Holding Ltd (N:BABA), has booked losses running into the hundreds of millions of dollars. PhonePe has said it hopes to turn profitable by 2022.
Indeed, profit margins in the digital payments business are generally thin, so to make money, Amazon may have to rely on services such as lending and insurance, industry watchers said.
""It is likely that the next step for Amazon would be to distribute exchange-traded funds and mutual funds,"" said Niren Shah, India head of Silicon Valley firm Norwest Venture Partners.
Others said Amazon's sheer muscle does not necessarily mean it can succeed in a market as huge and complex as India.

""It's not going to be easy to win over the Indian fin-tech market,"" said a person who declined to be identified due to a business relationship with Amazon. ""It's competitive and varied, so it's going to be a slow process.""

MELBOURNE (Reuters) -  Exxon Mobil  Corp (N:XOM) is assessing possible worldwide job cuts, a spokesman said on Wednesday, after the company announced a voluntary lay-off programme in Australia.
Exxon is the latest oil major to embark on axing jobs spurred by a historic collapse in fuel demand because of the coronavirus pandemic.
The company has slashed capital spending this year by 30% to around $23 billion and said in August it planned both capital and operating expense cuts to defend its dividend after reporting losses in the first and second quarters.
""We have evaluations underway on a country-by-country basis to assess possible additional efficiencies to right-size our business and make it stronger for the future,"" spokesman Casey Norton, based at the company headquarters in Irving, Texas, said in emailed comments to Reuters. 
The comments mark a shift, after Exxon told Reuters in July it had no plans for layoffs due to the pandemic and no percentage targets to reduce its workforce through this year's employee reviews.
In Australia, Exxon said on Wednesday it had completed a review of its current and future project work in the country and was seeking volunteers to quit the company.
""This program will ensure the company manages through these unprecedented market conditions,"" it said in a statement.
The company did not say what percentage of its workforce it was seeking to cut, but said in Australia it would consider all employees who expressed an interest in voluntary redundancy.
""Until other study work is complete, it would be premature to draw conclusions for other countries,"" Norton said. 
Exxon is looking to sell its 50% stake in the Bass Strait oil and gas joint venture in southeastern Australia, which analysts have estimated could fetch up to $3 billion.
Analysts have speculated it could also sell or close its Altona plant in Melbourne, Australia's oldest refinery.

Investing.com – Asian stocks were mixed on Wednesday morning, with positive U.S. manufacturing activity data fueling hopes of a global economic recovery from COVID-19.
The U.S. said on Tuesday that the ISM Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) rose to 56 in August, with a rise in new orders helping the index reach its highest level in more than a year. China also reported positive factory data on Tuesday, with the Caixin manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) for August rising to 53.1, its biggest rate of expansion since January 2011.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 edged up 0.19% by 11:15 PM ET (4:15 AM GMT), with Yoshihide Suga widely expected to formally announce his candidacy to lead the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) later in the day. The LDP will reportedly vote for a leader on September 14, the first concrete step to replacing incumbent Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.
South Korea’s KOSPI inched up 0.05%, with August’s consumer price index rising 0.7% year-on-year, according to data released earlier in the day.
Finance Minister Nam-ki Hong said on Tuesday that there would be a “targeted” second round of cash handouts to counter the economic impact of tighter social distancing measures due to the country’s latest COVID-19 outbreak. The government’s last cash handout was distributed in May.
In Australia, the ASX 200 jumped 1.61%. Data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics released earlier in the day confirmed that the country is in a recession, with GDP contracting by a record 7% quarter-on-quarter during the second quarter.
Meanwhile, the Australian state of Victoria is looking to ease lockdown restrictions as its second wave of infections seems to be coming under control. The state recorded 90 new COVID-19 cases on Wednesday, a third straight day of double-digit numbers.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index was down 0.61%. China’s Shanghai Composite fell 0.70% and the Shenzhen Component was down 0.24%.
Meanwhile, investors are keeping an eye on the U.S. Congress’ ongoing negotiations over the latest stimulus measures. However, a phone call between U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Tuesday concluded that Democrats and Republicans continue to have “serious differences” over the bill, dampening hopes for a quick resolution.
“Sadly, this phone call made clear that Democrats and the White House continue to have serious differences understanding the gravity of the situation that America’s working families are facing,” Pelosi said in a statement."

Despite Sino-U.S. political tensions, several U.S. asset managers are expanding their presence in China, after foreign ownership restrictions were scrapped earlier this year. 
BlackRock (N:BLK) last week became the first global asset manager to win regulatory approval to set up a mutual fund unit in China, and Vanguard Group announced it would shift its Asian headquarters to Shanghai and close its Hong Kong and Japan operations.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Tuesday issued a sweeping nationwide order temporarily halting millions of U.S. renters from being evicted, in a bid to reduce the spread of COVID-19.
The order covers all 43 million U.S. residential renters as long as they meet income eligibility requirements, although an administration official said the government does not expect an ""overwhelming"" use of the program.
The order lasts through Dec. 31 and applies to individual renters who do not expect to earn more than $99,000 this year or $198,000 for joint filers. It also applies to renters who did not report income in 2019 or received a stimulus check earlier this year.
The National Apartment Association said the CDC order risked further harm to the economy and would amplify the housing affordability crisis and destroy the rental housing industry. Without payments ""owners face a financial crisis of their own,"" it said.
Renters must file sworn declarations warning eviction would leave them homeless or force them into a ""shared living setting"" and attest they have done all they can to get government assistance for rent or housing.""
The administration warned renters could be ""prosecuted, go to jail, or pay a fine"" if they lie in declarations.
An administration official told reporters the order was not an invitation to stop paying rent and said renters should pay a portion of rent if possible. Renters will still owe accrued rent and face penalties for failing to pay.
The CDC order also said renters can ""still be evicted for reasons other than not paying rent or making a housing payment."" 
U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told a U.S. House of Representatives panel earlier the measure was to ensure people ""don't get thrown out of their rental homes.""
In July, a firm estimated more than $21.5 billion in past-due rent is owed by Americans.
As unemployment surged to levels unseen since the aftermath of the 1930s Great Depression, a patchwork of federal, state and local eviction bans has kept renters who could not make payments in homes.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Aug. 8 directed CDC to consider if temporarily halting residential evictions was ""reasonably necessary to prevent the further spread of COVID-19.""
The Democratic-controlled House of Representatives passed a bill in May to extend enhanced jobless aid through January and allocating $100 billion for rental assistance. It would extend the federal ban on evictions for up to one year. The bill has not been approved in the Senate.
A spokesman for Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden questioned why it took so long for Trump to back the moratorium and noted Biden backed the House proposal.

The household goods conglomerate behind the Omo, Cif, Sunlight and Domestos brands said that, instead of petrochemicals, the products would substitute constituents created from plants and other biological sources, marine sources such as algae and waste materials. 
Chemicals used in its cleaning and laundry products make up 46% of the company's Home Care division's carbon emissions across their lifecyle, and the switch - which Unilever said it is the first company to commit to - will cut those emissions by a fifth. 
Unilever's total greenhouse gas footprint is about 100 million metric tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalents globally.
The Anglo-Dutch maker of Dove soap and Knorr soup is currently facing unprecedented demand for cleaning products in response to the coronavirus pandemic.
It reported in July that Cif surface cleaners and Domestos bleach sales jumped in the double-digits in the first half of 2020. 
""People want more affordable sustainable products that are just as good as conventional ones,"" Peter ter Kulve, Unilever's President of Home Care said.
""We must stop pumping carbon from under the ground when there is ample carbon on and above the ground if we can learn to utilise it at scale,"" he added.
Unilever aims to reduce carbon emissions from its own operations and its suppliers to zero by 2039, an plan that is 11 years ahead of a deadline enshrined in the 2015 Paris Agreement on combating global warming. 
This year CDP, a global non-profit carbon disclosure group, 
ranked Unilever as one of only seven of 182 major companies to achieve an A rating for environment friendly governance in the three categories of climate change, water and forests.
Unilever said the 1 billion euro investment would be used to finance biotechnology research and carbon dioxide utilisation, and create biodegradeable and water-efficient product formulations. 
New products under its Persil brand, reformulated to use plant-based stain removers, will appear on UK supermarket shelves from this month, it added.

SEOUL (Reuters) - From sanitising closets to customisable fridges, the coronavirus pandemic has fanned demand for home appliances - so much so that Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) Co Ltd (KS:005930) is adding warehouses and bringing popular products to more markets.
In particular, consumers have been willing to splurge on products that make their homes cleaner. 
In Brazil and other emerging economies, households which once relied on maids are now investing in dishwashers and robot vacuum cleaners, while Samsung says its overseas sales of air purifiers jumped more than five times in January-July compared to the same period last year. 
Samsung's AirDresser, a closet that steam cleans clothes and kills bacteria, has seen a spike in sales with British furniture firm Lux Group ordering 1,000 earlier this year. Big fridges have also climbed in popularity as people cooking more often at home seek more freezer space.
""Sales are doing well in all but a few countries,"" Lee Jae-seung, executive vice president of Samsung Electronics' digital appliance business, told Reuters in an interview.
He said factories for Samsung's appliances business in the United States, Mexico, Poland, India and other countries were running at full capacity and the company was seeking more warehouse space in the United States, South Korea and Europe.
""There was a lot of pent-up demand in the U.S and elsewhere,"" Lee said. He added that many consumers seemed willing to spend money they might have otherwise used on trips and outdoor activities to upgrade their household interiors.
In its home market, Samsung's ""Bespoke"" refrigerators drove its fridge sales up 30% in the first half from the same period a year ago. The fridges, which come in a wide range of compartment sizes, panel types and colours that can be mixed and matched, were launched in China and Russia this year and will be sold in northern Europe from October.

Samsung does not disclose home appliance earnings, but according to UBS, its home appliance business made an operating profit of 337 billion won ($284.48 million) in the April-June quarter, up about 30% from a year earlier according to Seoul-based KTB Securities.

479,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 01, 2020 06:30PM ET</span>","Restrictions keep lenders, borrowers from Main Street Lending Program","By David Brooke
NEW YORK (LPC) - Restrictions within the US government's coronavirus aid Main Street Lending Program (MSLP) are staving off borrowers and lenders alike even as new lending activity begins to pick up in the middle market.
So far, just US$252m across 32 loans were committed or settled under the program, with a further US$604m in 55 loans under review, according to figures published on August 12 by the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, the organization managing the program. 
It is just a fraction of the overall US$600bn in available funds, which has raised questions from lawmakers about the viability of a program designed to provide immediate help to companies hit by the economic shutdown.
Restrictions on loan ownership embedded in the program is the main hurdles for lenders, according to some bank lenders. Banks underwrite the deals and the US government holds 95% of the individual loans made under the plan. The loans are either senior to or pari passu with a companies' existing debt, and benefit from government protection. 
Yet, even with banks taking significantly less risk than underwriting the entire loan themselves, many in the market see the shared collateral as a disincentive. 
By introducing new secured debt at the top of the capital structure, the existing lender then becomes subordinate in the claims over the collateral in the event of a bankruptcy. A lender that had an existing first-lien facility will no longer be first in line for payments if the collateral is liquidated.
""Banks take on 5% of the upside, but it's 100% of the administrative burden. The collection of the debt is on the bank,"" said Samuel Pizzichillo, a financial services audit senior-manager at accountancy firm Mazars USA. 
The program presents opportunities to access middle market borrowers, a relatively new customer base for some of these banks. The requirement for a loan to be priced at a maximum 300bp over Libor also puts financial institutions at a competitive advantage compared with private debt funds, which have gained market share in the middle market over the last decade and require higher returns for their risk. 
A typical senior loan provided by a private debt firm ranges between 500bp-700bp over Libor, according to sources.
""It is an opportunity to grab more market share, but you have to bifurcate the collateral with the government,"" said one banker.
BORROWER LIMITATIONS
The MSLP, which lives under the shadow of the government's Payment Protection Program (PPP), carries its own set of limitations for borrowers.
Both the PPP and MSLP followed the passing of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) act, designed to provide liquidity to small and medium-sized businesses to weather the coronavirus impact.
Under the PPP, more than five million loans were made totaling US$525bn, according to figures published by the US Treasury when the program closed on August 8. The MSLP, meanwhile, will remain open until the end of the year.
PPP financings were attractive to borrowers because the loans could be forgiven under certain conditions.
The PPP also offers greater freedom for companies than the MSLP, which limits dividend payouts 12 months after the repayment of the loan. The maximum amount a company can borrow under the PPP was US$10m, where as the MSLP offers borrowers up to US$35m in loan funding.
The heightened uncertainty brought on by the novel coronavirus dried out funding for middle market companies, which had been readily available from some banks and private credit funds before the onset of the pandemic.
Though the US economy's slow reopening has made such lenders more comfortable with the space, they are more inclined to support stronger credits, leaving weaker companies to seek PPP funds as they fall short of the risk a bank is willing to take. 
""It is a bit of a Catch-22. Weaker or more leveraged borrowers face eligibility issues, while stronger borrowers may find the terms too onerous compared to credit they can obtain outside the program,"" said Andrew Bettwy, a partner at law firm Proskauer. 
Lenders are also more likely to finance companies in their existing portfolio where due diligence has already been completed than chase new business. Due diligence processes have proven to be harder to undertake as travel restrictions prevailed over the last few months. 

""Underwriting a new issuer can be a slow process. A bank's existing relationship will likely already have an internal rating and there is a natural gravitation to existing clients,"" said Bettwy.

(Reuters) -  Bayer AG  (DE:BAYGN) has asked California's Supreme Court to review a decision awarding $20.5 million to a groundskeeper who claimed the company's Roundup weedkiller caused his cancer, arguing the ruling was at odds with federal law and settled legal principles.
Bayer (OTC:BAYRY), which acquired Roundup with its purchase of  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON) for $63 billion in 2018, said the July decision by the California Court of Appeal affirming a 2018 jury verdict in favor of Dewayne Johnson would be relied upon by other courts handling cases over the widely used herbicide. 
A San Francisco jury initially awarded Johnson $289.2 million after finding the chemical glyphosate in Roundup caused his non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
The trial judge reduced that amount to $78.5 million and the Court of Appeal reduced that to $20.5 million.
""In this case, the Court of Appeal affirmed a verdict that severely punishes Monsanto for complying with federal law,” said the petition by the company, which has long said regulators have deemed glyphosate safe for use by humans.
Bayer said the high court should determine if a manufacturer of a federally approved herbicide can be liable under state law for failing to provide a cancer warning when the federal regulator determined federal law does not permit that warning. 
Johnson also asked for a review of the Court of Appeal ruling reducing the damages.

481,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 01, 2020 05:36PM ET</span>","S&P, Nasdaq close at record highs in tech-fueled rally","By Sinéad Carew
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The S&P 500 and Nasdaq boasted record closing highs on Tuesday with technology leading the charge as Apple and Zoom Video soared while economic data and moves toward stimulus talks in Washington helped fuel optimism.
Tuesday's rally added to Wall Street's fifth straight monthly gain and the S&P 500's strongest August advance in more than three decades, which was also mostly thanks to technology stocks and central bank support.
Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) rose just under 4% on Tuesday, a day after its stock split and after a report said the company had asked suppliers to make at least 75 million 5G iPhones for later this year.
 Zoom Video Communications  (NASDAQ:ZM) Inc surged 40.8% after the videoconferencing company raised its annual revenue forecast by more than 30% as it converted more of its huge free user base to paid subscriptions. Along with Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), it provided Nasdaq's biggest boost for the day.
Investors cited technology momentum as the primary reason for Tuesday's gains, with some help from data and politics.
Tech companies have benefited from the pandemic-induced work-from-home trends and lower interest rates, said Greg Boutle, U.S. head of equity & derivative strategy at BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY) in New York. 
""At the moment the market is seeing a lot of positive momentum,"" said Boutle, so ""if you get OK-to-good data and anything from the political landscape that looks like it's moving more toward a compromise, that's constructive for markets.""
U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said he would telephone House Speaker Nancy Pelosi about stalled coronavirus aid negotiations later on Tuesday and White House chief of staff Mark Meadows said he expects Senate Republicans to bring up a targeted COVID-19 relief bill next week.
Earlier in the day ISM data showed U.S. factory activity expanded for the third straight month to a reading of 56.0 in August, the highest since November 2018. The figures follow encouraging manufacturing surveys from China and Europe earlier in the day.
However, employment continued to lag, according to ISM data, supporting views that the labor market recovery was losing momentum. Investors will keep a close eye on the monthly U.S. jobs report due on Friday.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 215.61 points, or 0.76%, to close at 28,645.66, the S&P 500 gained 26.34 points, or 0.75%, to 3,526.65 and the Nasdaq Composite added 164.21 points, or 1.39%, to 11,939.67.
The S&P ended the session more than 4% above its pre-crisis record, reached in February, while the Nasdaq finished 21.7% above its February peak in its 42nd closing high for 2020. The blue-chip Dow, meanwhile, was still 3% under its record.
Of the S&P's 11 major sectors the biggest percentage gainers were materials, information technology and consumer discretionary
But some strategists cautioned there could be more market volatility ahead as U.S. politics will take center stage in the coming weeks. Republican President Donald Trump, who is running for re-election against Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, has seen his polling gap with the former vice president narrow recently.
""There's still a lot of uncertainty mostly around the pandemic but also some uncertainty around the election. The closer we get to that election the more volatility we'll see in the market,"" said Veronica Willis, investment strategy analyst at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Investment Institute in St. Louis. Walmart (NYSE:WMT) rose more than 6% after the retailer unveiled the perks of its new loyalty program, Walmart Plus.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc fell 4.7% after the electric-car maker announced plans to raise up to $5 billion through a share sale program a day after its 5-for-1 stock split.
On U.S. exchanges 8.93 billion shares changed hands compared with the 9.14 billion average for the last 20 sessions.

483,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 01, 2020 04:54PM ET</span>",Nasdaq Volatility Twist Prompts Theories on Storm in Tech Stocks,"(Bloomberg) -- Wrinkles in the relationship between stock and options markets have a few Wall Street sleuths claiming to have unearthed clues to the storm raging in technology shares over the last few weeks.
They point to recent days when implied volatility on the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 rose even as equities rallied -- a rare alignment that is out of step with historical patterns. One theory is that an explosion in demand for call options to bet on megacap tech is feeding into gains in the stocks as dealers hedge.
Another view sees something less exotic -- investors protecting their portfolios in the volatility market in case stocks notch outsize price swings in the grip of the pandemic and the presidential election cycle.
Whatever the reason, traders have struggled to reconcile the steady rally in equities with the increase in implied volatility, which can be loosely defined as the price of equity options and usually falls when shares go up. They’re looking for explanations amid a rally that has driven the Nasdaq 100 high in 10 of the last 12 days and pushed companies such as Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc. and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). to giant advances.
At IPS Strategic Capital, head trader Pat Hennessy sums up the theory that points to call options. He reckons that strong demand for bullish derivatives on the biggest tech names has spurred dealers to bid up both stocks and their implied volatility indexes.
“The hedging of these positions is causing a feedback loop where vols and spot rise together,” Hennessy wrote on Twitter.
People are definitely trading a ton of options. Across U.S. exchanges last week, they bought 22 million more call contracts than they did puts, higher than the previous record set in June, according to Sundial Capital Research Inc. This happened as overall volume declined on the New York Stock Exchange, pushing speculative trading as a share of overall turnover “through the roof,” said Sundial president Jason Goepfert.
“The single stock option market is not that small,” wrote Vincent Cassot, head of equity derivatives research at Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY). “Apple options market is now way bigger than the one on the Russell 2000.”
As for its impact on the equity market, the theory goes like this. Rampant demand for call options in names like  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB). and Salesforce.com Inc (NYSE:CRM). has left derivative dealers on Wall Street dramatically short gamma, a measure of the change in an option’s sensitivity to moves in the underlying shares.
As the stock rises, the dealers need to buy more to hedge their exposure. With a large number of call contracts outstanding and “relative illiquidity” in some of these single-name shares, they have been forced to turn to proxies such as the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100, according to Hennessy. In order to hedge, dealers have been buying implied volatility on these benchmarks too.
Some see a small cohort of buyers driving the dislocation. A “massive upside premium buyer” has spent billions of dollars on single-name calls in megacap tech stocks such as Salesforce, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)., Apple and Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX). over the past month, according to Charlie McElligott, a cross-asset strategist at Nomura Securities. That’s forced dealers to buy Nasdaq 100 and S&P 500 futures in order to hedge those relatively illiquid single-stock options positions, he said.
Such a pattern may have played out in Saleforce’s 26% post-earnings surge, which dragged a handful of other high-profile tech shares higher, according to McElligott. Dealers were forced to recalibrate their hedges as a result, causing a feedback loop, he wrote.
If short gamma hedging lifted stocks, logically it should also be capable of exacerbating moves the other way. When shares fall, market makers are likely to unwind hedges at an increasing speed, spurring more losses. Examples of such events are common: Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY) shares in late 2008 or the spike in silver during 2011. Some even saw parallels in Tesla at the start of the year, though those moves look negligible compared with today’s.
As with all things in the world of volatility, nothing is straightforward. Whenever markets are moving in a way someone considers odd, people come out of the woodwork with exotic theories to explain it, and the options market is particularly fertile ground for their theories. While acknowledging the call buying,  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Group AG’s Mandy Xu says there’s another factor driving up implied volatility that’s less technical in nature: People worried about a crash.
“Contrary to consensus, this latest bid to implied vol has not come exclusively from the call side; we’ve seen a material increase in hedging demand over the past two weeks,” she wrote in a note today.
Xu cites an increase in one-month S&P 500 put skew, a measure of the price of bearish versus bullish options, rising to a 1-year high -- meaning demand for protection is climbing.
In any case, the convergence between the VIX and the S&P 500 Index has historically proved short-lived. The stock benchmark rose 0.8% Tuesday, while the volatility gauge fell.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention plans to temporarily halt evictions of consumers earning no more than $99,000 a year to prevent the virus from spreading, a senior administration official said Tuesday. The policy will take effect immediately.
The administration is acting unilaterally after failing to reach a deal with lawmakers over another round of stimulus relief funding, aimed in part at keeping renters in their homes.
To obtain the relief, renters must assert they are incapable of paying their rent or are likely to become homeless if kicked out of their property, the administration official said.
Individuals who received a coronavirus stimulus check earlier this year also qualify for the protection, as do couples who jointly file their taxes and expect to earn less than $198,000.
The move is an unprecedented use of executive authority, and may face legal challenges from landlords who have seen rental income evaporate during the crisis. But administration officials believe they have the ability under a federal law that allows the CDC to order emergency measures when it determines that state and local governments haven’t taken sufficient steps to prevent the spread of a communicable disease.
A White House lawyer who asked not to be identified discussing the measure said that the CDC Director has authority to take measures he deems reasonably necessary to prevent the spread of communicable diseases.
“President Trump is committed to helping hardworking Americans stay in their homes and combating the spread of the coronavirus,” White House spokesman Brian Morgenstern said in a statement. “Today’s announcement from his Administration means that people struggling to pay rent due to coronavirus will not have to worry about being evicted, and risk further spreading of or exposure to the disease due to economic hardship.”
Officials said the administration had made available stimulus funds to help offset the impact of the order for landlords and property owners. Roughly one in five American renters -- between 19 million and 23 million people -- are at risk of eviction by the end of September, according to an analysis by the Aspen Institute.
“This unprecedented action is further proof that President Trump is doing everything in his power to keep the American people safe and secure in their homes,” Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson said in a statement.
Those seeking eviction relief will still be required to pay as much rent as they can afford. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said earlier Tuesday that the actions taken by the administration could impact “close to” 40 million renters.
President Donald Trump’s effort to suspend evictions under the CDC order follows executive orders he signed in early August after negotiators were unable to strike a deal on another round of stimulus funding. Trump’s other executive orders were designed to provide a temporary payroll tax deferral for some workers, increase state unemployment benefits, and freeze federal student loans.
Democrats have noted the administration has struggled to implement the unilateral tax and unemployment benefits, and called for the White House to increase its willingness to spend as part of the next round of funding. The Democratic-controlled House passed a bill in May that included $100 billion for rental assistance, but the White House and Senate Republicans have said the package – with a price tag over $3 trillion – is too high.
Mnuchin said he plans to speak with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi about continuing those talks later Tuesday.

""The United States will continue to engage our international partners to ensure we defeat this virus, but we will not be constrained by multilateral organizations influenced by the corrupt World Health Organization and China,"" White House spokesman Judd Deere (NYSE:DE) said in a statement.
""This President will spare no expense to ensure that any new vaccine maintains our own FDA's gold standard for safety and efficacy, is thoroughly tested, and saves lives,"" he said.
U.S. Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Stephen Hahn told the Financial Times in an interview published on Sunday that the FDA was prepared to authorize a coronavirus vaccine before late-stage Phase Three clinical trials were complete, as long as officials are convinced that the benefits outweigh the risks.
On Monday, World Health Organization officials said moving too quickly to make a vaccine widely available could pose risks.
""If you move too quickly to vaccinate ... millions of people, you may miss certain adverse effects,"" said Mike Ryan, the head of WHO's emergencies program.
WHO chief scientist Soumya Swaminathan said the FDA's approach was ""not something that you do very lightly."" She said WHO's preferred approach would be to have a full set of data which could be used for the pre-qualification of vaccines.
President Donald Trump has been critical of the WHO's handling of the coronavirus pandemic, accusing it of being too focused on China and issuing bad advice. In May, Trump announced the United States was cutting ties to the organization. 
Phase Three trials, in which randomized patients are treated with a drug or a placebo without participants or doctors knowing which group they were in, are considered the gold standard for clinical trials.

489,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 01, 2020 03:41PM ET</span>","Thousands of small-business loans may have been fraudulent, U.S. House panel finds","By Susan Cornwell and David Morgan
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Tens of thousands of loans worth billions of dollars may have been subject to fraud, waste and abuse in the $659 billion taxpayer-funded program aimed at helping small U.S. businesses survive the coronavirus pandemic, according to a report released by Democratic lawmakers on Tuesday.
Over $1 billion from the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) went to companies that received multiple loans, in violation of the program's rules, the House of Representatives Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis said.
Committee Chairman James Clyburn said the Trump administration should have done more to prevent fraud.
""Taxpayers should not have to choose between quickly getting aid to those who need it and wasting federal funds. And there are simple steps that could have been taken to improve oversight and reduce fraud,"" Clyburn said.
Democrats in Congress and the Trump administration have been at loggerheads over further steps to bolster the economy after Congress approved some $3 trillion in the spring to respond to the coronavirus pandemic.
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told the committee that he believed the economy was recovering strongly but said more government relief is needed. He said the administration would unveil details later on Tuesday on an effort to protect 40 million renters from eviction. 
""The president and I want to move forward with more fiscal response,"" Mnuchin said. 
Congressional Democrats and the Republican Trump administration since early August have not been able to bridge a gap of more than $1 trillion between their proposed relief packages.
Mnuchin said he was willing to provide more money for state and local governments, a key sticking point, despite his belief that they were ""hoarding"" prior aid.
Mnuchin said he would call House Speaker Nancy Pelosi about the stalled talks after the hearing.
The PPP provided more than 5.2 million forgivable loans through the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) by the time it ended on Aug. 8. The SBA did not immediately respond to requests for comment, but its internal watchdog has also found ""strong indicators"" of potential PPP fraud.
The Trump administration says the PPP has saved some 51 million jobs at a time when much of the U.S. economy has been shuttered due to the coronavirus. Economists say the actual impact is far lower, likely between 1 million and 14 million jobs.
In a separate report, Republicans on the committee said PPP has seen lower levels of fraud than other large government relief programs, such as those following Hurricanes Sandy and Katrina.
The Democratic-led panel found more than 600 loans went to companies that should have been ineligible because they had been barred from doing business with the government. Another 350 loans went to contractors with previous performance problems.

Nearly $3 billion went to businesses that were flagged as potentially problematic by a government-contracting database.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Trade Representative's office said on Tuesday it has extended China tariff exclusions for a wide range of goods, including smart watches and certain medical masks, through the end of 2020, rather than renewing the previous one-year extensions.
The extension of only four months would likely maintain some leverage over China's implementation of a Phase 1 trade deal, but would increase uncertainty for importers of products ranging from Bluetooth devices to upright pianos. 
In a Federal Register notice https://s3.amazonaws.com/public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2020-19419.pdf, USTR said the extensions applied to products excluded from ""Section 301"" tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump a year ago on a range of Chinese consumer goods amid tense trade negotiations between the world's two largest economies. The tariffs on some $125 billion worth of goods were set at 15%, then lowered to 7.5% by the Phase 1 deal signed in January.
The products included a number of Bluetooth and wearable data-transmitting devices, such as those imported from China by Apple Inc (O:AAPL), FitBit (N:FIT), Sonos (O:SONO) and other technology companies.
Also on the list of extended exclusions were a number of face masks, respirators and other medical products, including stethoscope covers, cotton gauze sponges and blood pressure cuff sleeves. Products ranging from upright pianos to liquid crystal display modules and stainless steel watch cases also were excluded until year-end.
USTR had previously granted one-year exclusions from the tariffs. The Federal Register notice did not indicate a specific reason for extending the exclusions for only four months, but the Trump administration has threatened to raise tariffs should China fail to implement the Phase 1 agreement launched in February.
A USTR spokesman could not immediately be reached for further comment.
While U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Chinese Vice Premier Liu He reaffirmed their commitment to the deal last week, China's purchases of U.S. goods and services are well behind the pace needed to meet first year targets of a $77 billion increase over 2017 levels. 
""The U.S. Trade Representative will take account of the cumulative effect of exclusions in considering the possible further extension of the exclusions covered by this notice, as well as possible extensions of exclusions of other products covered by the action in this investigation,"" the agency said.

496,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 01, 2020 12:50PM ET</span>",Toyota U.S. August sales fall 23% as pandemic weighs on inventory,"By Nick Carey and Rachit Vats
(Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203) on Tuesday reported a 23% drop in U.S. new vehicle sales in August versus the same month in 2019, as a two-month industrywide shutdown of auto production in the spring to halt the spread of COVID-19, as well as an uncertain economic recovery, weighed on sales.
This was Toyota's fifth straight month of U.S. sales declines. 
South Korean automaker  Hyundai Motor  Co (KS:005380) said its U.S. sales fell 8.4% in August, largely due to a decline in fleet sales to rental car companies, government agencies and corporations. Hyundai had posted a slight sales gain in July.
Automakers have struggled to get inventory to dealers to replenish stocks following the pandemic-fueled shutdowns. 
This has enabled them to scale back consumer discounts on popular models and raise vehicle prices. 
According to consultancies LMC and J.D. Power, which had predicted industrywide U.S. new vehicle sales to be down 20% in August, nearly 45% of vehicles sold during the month spent fewer than 20 days on dealer lots, 35 percentage points more than the previous year. 
TrueCar Inc (O:TRUE) subsidiary ALG said on Tuesday that the average transaction price for vehicles was up 3.9% in August versus the same month in 2019.
While U.S. demand for new vehicles has remained stronger than expected after driving off a cliff in March and April as a number of states shut down because of the coronavirus, there is plenty of uncertainty over whether a sustained recovery is possible. 
Outbreaks of COVID-19 across southern and southwestern U.S. states during the summer appear to have slowed the economic recovery. Unemployment remains high and could weigh further on sales moving forward.

Investing.com --   Quest Diagnostics (NYSE:DGX) dropped more than 2.2% on Tuesday after being dropped by the state of Florida for being too slow.
The Florida Department of Health and the Florida Division of Emergency Management said it would cut ties with Quest because it's not reporting coronavirus test results quickly enough. 
The governor’s office was told on Monday that nearly 75,000 tests, dating as far back as April, had yet to be entered into the Covid-19 monitoring system, CBS Channel 12 News reported. Most of the data was over two weeks old. 
""To drop this much unusable and stale data is irresponsible,"" said Governor Rick DeSantis. ""Quest has abdicated their ability to perform a testing function in Florida that the people can be confident in. As such I am directing all executive agencies to sever their Covid-19 testing relationships with Quest effective immediately.""    
Shares had risen more than 50% since April. The company introduced a new lab test for the virus in March, and accounted for nearly half of U.S. testing that month. It still handles as much as 20% of testing efforts across the country, Quest says on its website. 
Quest labs processed 9.2 million active infection tests and 2.8 million antibody tests from March 9 to July 27.

500,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 01, 2020 12:18PM ET</span>",Fed’s Mortgage-Buying Spree at $1 Trillion With No End in Sight,"(Bloomberg) -- The Federal Reserve has snapped up $1 trillion of mortgage bonds since March, a record pace of purchasing, as the U.S. central bank tries to blunt the impact of the Covid-19 recession on American homeowners.
The Fed bought around $300 billion of the bonds in each of March and April, and since then has been buying about $100 billion a month. It now owns almost a third of bonds backed by home loans in the U.S. Buying the securities has pushed mortgage rates lower, with the average 30-year rate falling to 2.91% as of last week from 3.3% in early February.
That drop has allowed homeowners to refinance their mortgages, tantamount to giving them a raise by cutting their monthly loan payments. It’s also helped consumers buy homes. But the Fed’s efforts are causing its balance sheet to balloon, and with the central bank owning so many U.S. home loans, it has unusually high power over setting mortgage rates.
The Fed’s purchase efforts started off with a bang on March 15, when it said it was slashing its benchmark interest rate back to 0% and would purchase “at least” $200 billion of mortgage-backed securities. On March 23, the central bank signaled its willingness to buy near-unlimited amounts of the debt, changing “at least” in its statement to “in the amounts needed.”
By the end of that month, mortgage purchases totaled $291 billion, an average of $23.4 billion per day. That was in a month when just $162 billion of mortgage bonds were created.
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analysts pointed out in late March that the buying was running at eight times the pace seen in prior episodes of Fed purchasing under programs known as quantitative easing, a pace that has since slowed. The current monthly rate of about $100 billion translates to about $40 billion net, after accounting for borrowers’ principal repayments from the mortgage bonds already on the Fed’s balance sheet.
The latest statement from the Fed has promised to keep buying “at least at the current pace.” If the central bank does so, by year’s end it will have purchased about $1.4 trillion in mortgage bonds -- and added around $900 billion net to its holdings.
Fueling Growth
That purchasing will fuel the growth of the mortgage-backed securities market, which finances the majority of the roughly $11 trillion of U.S. single-family home loans outstanding. Back in December, consensus was for net supply to come in around $265 billion this year -- a level that would be right in line with the annual average of $270 billion over the last half decade. JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co. analysts last month raised their forecast to $390 billion, which would be the highest since 2009.
According to the JPMorgan analysts, the increased size of the market makes the Fed’s pace of buying sustainable. Between September 2012 and October 2014, during a quantitative easing program known as QE3, the Fed owned a record 34% of the market.
Just before this latest round, principal payments from its mortgage bond holdings had whittled that down to 21%, but it has now increased back to 30%. If the Fed maintains its current buying pace, it will again own 34% of the mortgage universe by year’s end, the analysts added.
Supporting Economy
The Fed’s purchase activity has allowed risk premiums, or spreads, on mortgage bonds to remain little changed now compared with the end of last year. It has also helped improve mortgage-bond returns for the year, compared with performance in the first few months of 2020. The Bloomberg  Barclays  (LON:BARC) U.S. MBS index’s has bounced back to -0.34% as of Friday’s close from a year-to-date low of -2.87% on March 19.
Buying so many home loans is the right thing for the central bank to do to support the economy, Kevin Jackson, a managing director on the mortgage trading desk at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co., said in an interview with Bloomberg.
“We had a pandemic arise and you needed a force to come into the market and stabilize things,” Jackson said.

Zoom shares soared as much as 47% to $478 in morning trade, with brokerages raising price guidance by an average of $161 after the company reported blockbuster quarterly results and lifted its annual revenue forecast.
The numbers also indicate that one of the success stories during the coronavirus pandemic is turning its huge free-user base into hard cash.
Chief Financial Officer Kelly Steckelberg said Zoom revenue grew so quickly that it was hard to keep investing at the same pace.
The top-growing sectors for the company during its second quarter were education, non-profits, manufacturing and healthcare, she told Reuters on Tuesday. 
""With ZM now clearly established as the global leader in the video collaboration market, its success paves a more clear path to compete in the enterprise market,"" Rosenblatt analysts wrote.
J.P.Morgan analyst Sterling Auty, however, warned the churn rate for Zoom's high-risk small customers pointed to the risk of a pullback in revenue as the pandemic eases.
""The surge in growth has come increasingly from the riskiest customer segment,"" he said. ""Customers with less than 10 employees reached 36% of total revenue in the quarter.""
Video conferencing platforms have become a vital part of day-to-day life for people stuck at home under the coronavirus-related restrictions, be it for work, school or socializing. 
But they face the risk of a drop in usage as people return to work from big office buildings. 
Zoom said on Monday it was experiencing slightly higher rates of customer cancellation than the historical average, but had factored this into its forecasts.

""While it is extremely hard to gauge where ... demand will peak, it looks to us like even aggressive sales and marketing investments will not be able to stave off growth deceleration,"" said  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) analyst Walter Pritchard.

505,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 01, 2020 10:35AM ET</span>",Samsung leader Jay Y. Lee indicted in South Korea on allegations linked to 2015 merger,"By Joyce Lee and Heekyong Yang
SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korean prosecutors indicted Samsung (KS:005930) Group's Jay Y. Lee on Tuesday on suspicion of accounting fraud and stock price manipulation in connection with a 2015 merger, dealing a new blow to the head of one of Asia's most valuable companies. 
Lee, who has already served jail time in connection with a separate case, and 10 other current and former Samsung executives were indicted over the merger of two Samsung affiliates that helped Lee assume greater control of the group's crown jewel, Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF).
The indictment paves the way for Lee, 52, to undergo trial on the allegations. He will not be detained as a Seoul court denied a request from prosecutors in June for an arrest warrant.
But the court said prosecutors seemed to have secured a considerable amount of evidence and it was appropriate to send the case to trial.
The decision comes as President Moon Jae-in rallies big business during a recession driven by the novel coronavirus, and at a time the public might be more interested in controlling the disease and reviving livelihoods than punishing the family-run conglomerates, known as chaebol, that dominate the economy.
Charges against Lee included the practice of unfair transaction and manipulation of market prices under the Capital Markets Act, breach of trust during the course of business, and false disclosure and accounting fraud under the External Audit Act, prosecutors said in a statement.
""We took into account the gravity of the issue, which disturbed the order of the capital market,"" said Lee Bok-hyun, senior prosecutor at the Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office.
Jay Y Lee's attorneys denied the allegations in a statement, calling the indictment unjust, but said the defendants would ""conscientiously participate"" in a trial.
'OBJECTIVE TRUTH'
The $8 billion merger of affiliates Samsung C&T Corp and Cheil Industries in 2015 was seen as key to Lee increasing control of the sprawling group, even as critics said it rode roughshod over the interests of minority investors.
Prosecutors also alleged that Lee and other Samsung executives colluded to inflate the assets of Samsung BioLogics Co Ltd to avoid criticism that the merger was agreed at terms favourable to shareholders of Cheil Industries, which counted Lee as the biggest shareholder. Cheil was a major shareholder of BioLogics.
Prosecutors decided to indict Lee despite an independent panel's recommendation in June against such action. The decision by the panel, which consisted mostly of non-financial experts, had invited criticism from some lawmakers and experts who raised concern that the panel system could be abused by the wealthy and powerful.
Lee's lawyers said the prosecutors decision to ""flout the independent panel's decision and belatedly add a breach of trust allegation suggests prosecutors conducted the investigation with the goal of prosecuting Samsung Group and Lee Jae-yong (Jay Y. Lee) from the beginning, rather than seek objective truth based on evidence."" 
Capital Markets Act violations can be punished with jail of five years to life if a court finds the amount the defendant unlawfully gained or avoided losing is 5 billion won ($4.22 million) or more.
Lee, vice-chairman of Samsung Electronics which has a market value of $311 billion, was jailed for about a year, until his release in February 2018, for his role in a bribery scandal.
He was accused of giving horses to the daughter of a confidante of former President Park Geun-hye to win government support for the merger of the two affiliates.
Shares of major Samsung firms were largely unperturbed by the announcement. Samsung Electronics ended up 0.4% and Samsung C&T rose 2.3% compared with the broader market's 1% rise.

Unveiled on Tuesday, the Galaxy Z Fold2's screen measures 7.6 inches (19.3 cm) when unfolded. The 5G compatible phone will also be Samsung (KS:005930)'s most expensive foldable, priced at $1,999 in the United States compared to $1,980 for the Galaxy Fold launched last year.
The new model, however, is facing a tough market with economic uncertainties created by the coronavirus pandemic cooling demand for high-end smartphones.
Despite the launch of its premium Galaxy S20 lineup in March, Samsung has fared particularly badly. Its second-quarter smartphone sales plummeted 30% and South Korean tech giant ceded its position as the world's biggest smartphone seller to Chinese rival Huawei Technologies Co Ltd [HWT.UL], according to research firm Canalys.
Offered in two colours - mystic black and mystic bronze - the Galaxy Z Fold2 will go on sale on Sept. 18 in about 40 countries.

(Reuters) - Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) on Tuesday unveiled its biggest program of new share sales as a public company, seeking to cash in on soaring Wall Street interest in the electric carmaker to raise up to $5 billion that will ease future debt pressures.
The move comes a day after a 5-for-1 stock split took effect, Tesla's first since its initial public offering in June 2010, and follows a nearly six-fold increase in the value of its shares this year. 
Tuesday's share sale comes as Tesla seeks to massively expand production of its existing vehicles and build new factories near Berlin, Germany and Austin, Texas. The company also plans to launch new lines of vehicles, including a semi-truck called the Tesla Semi and its futuristic Cybertruck.
Tesla said it plans to use proceeds from the offering to strengthen its balance sheet and for general corporate purposes.
Craig Irwin, a Roth Capital Partners analyst who has the equivalent of a 'hold' rating on the stock, on Tuesday said the capital raise did not come as a surprise.
""They will need cash for all the facilities they are building, and new growth initiatives,"" Irwin said.
Ten major banks, including Goldman Sachs (N:GS), Bank of America Securities (N:BAC),  Citigroup  Global Markets (N:C) and  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS), will conduct the sale, the electric carmaker said in a filing, giving no deadline for its completion. (https:// David Whiston, an analyst at Morningstar Research, said it remained to be seen how much money Tesla will ultimately raise. The company had $8.6 billion in cash and cash equivalents at the end of June.  ""I can understand them taking advantage of the stock’s incredible run, but they don’t need the money right now,"" Whiston said. Tesla in February had announced plans to raise $2 billion in a stock offering. Tesla shares, which rose about 8% in early premarket trading, retreated to trade about 1% higher on the day after the news. The company's high-flying stock has risen another 70% since the split was announced on Aug. 11, and was trading at over $2,000 before the division on Friday.  With a market capitalization now around $465 billion, it became the world's biggest car company by value in July and has propelled Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk's personal fortune past $100 billion.  Musk has repeatedly assured investors over the past year that Tesla would not need to raise more money for costly expansion initiatives or to pay down debt.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened mixed on Tuesday as Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Chief Executive Elon Musk decided to test the strength of demand for his newly-split stock by announcing plans to sell another $5 billion of it.
The rally this year in Tesla stock has been so violent that the new capital raise amounts to only a 1.1% dilution of existing shareholders. Had Musk tried to raise the same amount only two months ago, the dilutive effect would have been twice as strong.
Tesla stock was down 4.6% by 9:59 AM ET (1359 GMT).
The broader market was starting September in breather mode after its best August in three decades. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was little changed at 28,450, while the S&P 500 index was up 0.3%.
The Nasdaq Composite was up 0.9%, helped by a 34% rise in Zoom Video (NASDAQ:ZM) stock after the videoconferencing company reported a blowout quarter for the three months through July.
Zoom had posted a set of earnings after the closing bell on Monday that far exceeded even the most optimistic forecasts for both revenue and profit. The results were taken as a sign that the company is coping with the challenges of scaling up in the face of a huge surge in demand thanks to the shift to working and learning from home.
The market got a boost from the release of the Institute of Supply Management’s national purchasing managers’ index for August, which rose by more than expected to 56.0, its highest level since April last year.
Together with similarly upbeat readings across much of Asia and Europe, the data helped reassure market participants that the world economy’s recovery is still on track."
511,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 01, 2020 09:36AM ET</span>","Continental Deepens Restructuring Cuts With 30,000 Jobs at Risk","(Bloomberg) -- Continental AG (OTC:CTTAY) plans to cut or transfer as many as 30,000 jobs to reduce costs by more than 1 billion euros ($1.2 billion) a year, deepening restructuring as the coronavirus adds to pressure on the auto industry.
Some 90% of the restructuring measures will be implemented by 2025, Continental said Tuesday. Its domestic German operations will be hit hard, with about 13,000 positions moved to other areas or eliminated.
The industry is facing the biggest crisis in 70 years and parts suppliers are “hit particularly hard,” Chief Executive Officer Elmar Degenhart said in the statement.
The auto industry is suffering from the fallout from Covid-19 at the same time it faces pressure to invest in new technology as the combustion era gradually draws to a close and car-sharing services gnaw at demand.
The company, which was already targeting changes that could affect 20,000 employees before the pandemic hit, aims to reach the new savings target in 2023.
The shares swung to a loss on the news, falling as much as 3.2% and trading down 2.9% at 3:13 p.m. in Frankfurt. Europe’s second biggest automotive supplier has lost more than a fifth of its value this year.
‘Severe Blow’
Signs are that a tentative rebound in car demand is losing steam. Car sales fell in France and Spain in August, erasing gains made during the previous months.
Continental has been reluctant so far to provide an outlook for the full year, citing swirling market uncertainty. The German automotive giant said on Tuesday that it doesn’t expect the global market to return to the 2017 level until the middle of the decade.
The Hanover-based company had already embarked on a far-reaching overhaul last year when the global economy softened and vehicle production started to slow. The initial plan to restore margins was rendered insufficient by the pandemic.
The manufacturer, which employs about 232,000 people worldwide, including 59,000 in Germany, said the ongoing restructuring has affected roughly 3,000 positions. The company’s employee representatives reacted angrily to the latest cuts and demanded fairer and more balanced measures.
“That’s a severe blow,” Hasan Allak, Continental’s top labor leader, said in a statement. “In combination with the management mistakes of the past years such as exaggerated growth targets, quality problems and multi-billion dollar writeoffs, a fatal picture emerges.”

(Reuters) - U.S. online wholesale retailer Boxed is exploring strategic options, including a sale or going public through a merger with a blank-check acquisition company that could value it at around $1 billion, according to people familiar with the matter.
Referred to by some of its customers as Costco (O:COST) for millennials, New York-based Boxed offers everything from fresh groceries to office supplies without membership fees, and also provides free delivery for orders over $49.
Like many e-commerce businesses, it has benefited from a boom in online sales in the United States as consumers stay away from brick-and-mortar stores due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Boxed has seen an steady uptick in new customer signups since March, one of the sources said.
The company has hired investment bank  Citigroup  Inc (N:C) to advise on the sale, the sources said, requesting anonymity as the matter is private.
The company has held discussions with potential buyers including so-called special-purpose acquisition companies (SPACs), the sources said, cautioning that it is possible no deal will ultimately materialize.
Boxed and Citi declined to comment.
A merger with a SPAC has emerged in recent months as an increasingly popular alternative to initial public offerings. The likes of sports betting platform DraftKings Inc (O:DKNG) and electric vehicle maker  Nikola Corp  (O:NKLA) have gone public this year through reverse mergers with SPACs.
Seven-year-old Boxed has raised over $240 million in funding from investors including  American Express  Co (N:AXP) and GGV Capital, and was last valued at $600 million in 2018, according to PitchBook.
Last year, former Amazon.com (O:AMZN) executive Prentis Wilson joined Boxed as president to run its core wholesale business.
E-commerce sales in the United States grew 44.5% in the second quarter, the fastest growth in over two decades, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce.
Wish, another popular shopping app known for selling bargains, said on Monday it has filed confidentially to go public.

LONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - The COVID-19 pandemic will mean holiday-goers will shy away from larger hotels for the foreseeable future in favor of boutiques and home rentals, the CEO of India-based hospitality startup Oyo Hotels and Homes told Reuters. 
The comments by Ritesh Agarwal underscore the anticipation within the hospitality industry that the coronavirus outbreak will fundamentally change the nature of travel. 
""The hospitality industry will never be the same again, that is absolutely clear,"" Agarwal said in a video interview. 
""Small hotels are going to be in vogue. In my view, small is going to be the new big, wherein people will rethink a lot about going back to that 1,000-room hotel versus going to a 40-room niche hotel.""
Oyo, founded by Agarwal in 2013 when he was 18, allows guests to book hotels through its mobile app and also franchises its brand and offers standardized amenities at hotels on its network. 
Loss-making Oyo, which is backed by Japan's SoftBank Group Corp, says its network comprises more than 43,000 hotels with over 1 million rooms across more than 800 cities in 80 countries. 
The hospitality industry has been one of the most adversely affected by the coronavirus health crisis and Oyo cut thousands of jobs at the height of the pandemic earlier this year. 
Gurugram, India-based Oyo has seen some green shoots of recovery, according to Agarwal. 
""The last four, five months the company has seen some incremental recovery, especially in geographies such as Europe and the United States,"" he said. 
In the United States, where Oyo customers are primarily truckers, pharmaceutical reps and so-called essential workers, the company's revenue per available room is around 92% of pre-coronavirus levels and OYO has seen record sales, Agarwal said. 
One of India's largest start-ups, Oyo was last valued at $10 billion in its most recent private fundraising round in December. 
The company has upwards of $1 billion in cash in the bank and Agarwal said COVID-19 had not had an impact on any potential plans for an initial public offering (IPO). 
""We did not have a timeline for going public earlier and don't have one now,"" said Agarwal. ""We of course continue to keep a close eye on the market and get potential interest of potential capital raise, both private and non-private.""

514,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 01, 2020 08:27AM ET</span>",Bond Steepener Bets Cross the Atlantic on Europe Inflation Risk,"(Bloomberg) -- One of the most popular U.S. bond trades is fast becoming a trend across the Atlantic as well.
At least five European banks have piled into recommendations for a steeper yield curve -- which implies a growing premium to hold longer-maturity debt than shorter-dated securities. That’s largely a reflection of the growing concern over inflation and record levels of government borrowing.
In the U.S., Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell appeared to give the market the green light for such trades last week, by signaling the institution would tolerate an overshoot of its 2% inflation target temporarily, before acting to restrain prices.
“When we’re down and troubled, steeper curves offer a ray of hope,” wrote  ING Groep  (AS:INGA) NV strategists led by Padhraic Garvey in a note to clients. “They by definition discount better times ahead. There has been steepening recently, and we think more is coming.”
Global markets have been beset by fears that inflation could roar back thanks to unprecedented stimulus from governments and central banks as they attempt to stem the economic fallout from the coronavirus. Rising prices erode the value of holding bonds, especially longer-dated securities, meaning that those are more likely to fall than shorter-dated notes.
The likes of  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Plc and UBS Group AG (SIX:UBSG) recommend that investors position for higher long-dated rates via trades that anticipate a steeper interest-rate swap curve. For  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C)., the transaction also acts as a hedge for any breakthrough on a vaccine for the coronavirus, which would likely spark a selloff in the bond market.
What Bloomberg Intelligence says:
“The curve may steepen on post-summer increase in supply and catch-up to higher inflation pricing. But don’t expect any tantrum, any repricing is looking modest at best.”
-- Tanvir Sandhu, Chief Global Derivatives Strategist
The U.K.’s case isn’t different either, with  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). recommending positioning for the yield premium on 30-year bonds over two-year ones to increase. The bank sees the Bank of England potentially changing the sequencing of any tightening of monetary policy, allowing quantitative easing to run off before interest rates are raised significantly.
For Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) SA, the steepener trade should benefit from investors abandoning their summer caution as well as progress on the European Union’s landmark recovery fund, which has buoyed sentiment across the region. Bond supply too is set to pick up into year-end.
“Summer jitters did not materialize,” wrote SocGen strategists led by Adam Kurpiel. “New issuance is the key focus now.”

(Reuters) -  Uber Technologies Inc  (N:UBER) on Tuesday said it will roll out a global selfie feature to verify its ride-hail customers wear a mask, modeled after a similar feature introduced for drivers in mid-May.
Uber instituted its ""No Mask No Ride"" policy on May 18 and extended it indefinitely due to the ongoing pandemic, requiring both drivers and riders to wear a face covering at all times during a ride.
Drivers are required to take a selfie with a mask each day before starting work, while drivers and riders are able to cancel a trip without penalty if they report the other party is not wearing a mask. Failure to comply can lead to account deactivation. 
The rider selfie feature will be rolled out in the United States and Canada by the end of September, and across Latin America and other regions after that, Uber said.
Unlike for drivers, the rider app will only prompt a passenger to take a selfie if a driver previously reported they were not wearing a mask.
""We definitely wanted to make sure that we are targeting this feature to riders who are maybe just coming back to the platform and maybe they're not aware of ... our (mask) policy,"" Sachin Kansal, Uber's Senior Director of Product Management, said in an interview.
Demand for ride-hailing trips has dropped sharply during the pandemic, especially in the United States, Uber's largest market.
Kansal said 99.5% of all Uber trips since mid-May had been completed without driver or rider complaints over masks.
The selfie feature does not use facial recognition technology, but simply detects the mask as an object on the face, Kansal said. Uber stores selfie photos for 96 hours to settle potential disputes, but then permanently deletes them, a spokesman added.

(Reuters) - Instant coffee, ketchup, Lululemon yoga pants and  Nike  Air Max sneakers are all in. Bottled water, pricey diapers and  Burberry  luxury trench coats are out.
Welcome to America's pandemic consumer economy. And it's like nothing we've seen before.
""Everything we knew about supply and demand, we can essentially throw out the window because consumer behavior has changed completely,"" said Piotr Dworczak, assistant professor of economics at Northwestern (NYSE:NWE) University.
A Reuters analysis of a varied basket of goods shows how the COVID-19 crisis has upturned a decades-old consumer model for everything from clothing to food. This has given some companies surprising power to raise prices or withdraw discounts.
Many of the new trends can be attributed to one factor, according to retail specialists: working from home.
Almost overnight, a consumer-driven economy with clearly delineated work and home spending, changed profoundly. Rising demand for certain items, as well as global supply-chain disruptions, has driven up prices.
Americans are now shelling out significantly more than a year before for coffee, eggs, sliced ham, ketchup and cheese, for example, according to the Reuters analysis of the latest pricing data from Nielsen Co, the Brewers Association and StyleSage Co. 
Yet it's a complex picture, and some of the changes in behavior seem counter-intuitive during a time of deep economic uncertainty. 
Demand and prices have also increased for more expensive, or ""splurge"", items like $106 men's Nike (N:NKE) Air Max sneakers, $105 Lululemon (O:LULU) yoga pants and even a $1,500 Louis Vuitton (PA:LVMH) handbag. 
Economists put this apparent discrepancy in behavior down to the fact that many people, unable to spend outside, have more cash in hand. Even many workers on furlough are receiving jobless benefits that match their wages under a federal stimulus plan.
""If I were to consider the consumer situation right now, in a strange way, they may have more disposable income, if they kept their job,"" said Nirupama Rao, an assistant professor of business economics and public policy at the University of Michigan. ""Of course we're facing mass layoffs, but the bulk of people have maintained their wages and earnings.""

'UNPRECEDENTED PRESSURE'
Shoppers paid roughly 8% more on average for JM Smucker's (N:SJM) instant coffees, including Folger's and Dunkin', at bricks-and-mortar stores in the four weeks to Aug. 8 versus a year before, according to Nielsen data analyzed by Bernstein. 
They shelled out nearly 10% more for Kraft Heinz (O:KHC) sauces and about 5% extra for  Tyson Foods ' (N:TSN) sliced hams.
Such inflation might make commercial sense, given the bump in demand for home staples. But some consumer experts complain retailers and big brands are cutting back on promotions and using their power to shore up profits during a health crisis that has led to millions losing their livelihoods. 
""Brand manufacturers have been fattening their pockets with profits while putting unprecedented pressure on the consumer who has to pay those higher prices,"" said Burt Flickinger, retail consultant at Strategic Resource Group. 
JM Smucker said it did not raise prices of its instant coffees in the four weeks to Aug. 8, but did cut back on some promotions for in-demand products. Kraft Heinz declined to comment, but said during earnings in July that second-quarter prices went up as it pulled some offers and discounts for scarce products. Tyson did not respond to a request for comment.
Other industry experts point out that companies have had to grapple with costly production shifts to adapt to the new landscape. They note that before the pandemic, when costs were lower and there were more promotions and discounts, prices of Heinz sauces were declining. 
Pre-COVID-19, tens of millions of commuters grabbed a coffee to-go en route to work. Suddenly, instead of 20-pound (9.1 kg) bags of coffee for restaurants, or large containers of ketchup, producers have had to switch to smaller, home-use packaging.
As ketchup, mayonnaise and vinegar sales surged, Kraft Heinz diverted resources to running these production lines around the clock, while suspending others. It added extra shifts for factory workers to make grocery-sized bottles.
Egg suppliers, like market leader  Cal-Maine Foods  Inc (O:CALM), have had to overcome a shortage of cartons.
""If you look at eggs, before they'd be powdered to send to restaurants and now they have to be put in cardboard containers to go to supermarkets,"" said Daniel Bachman, senior U.S. economist at Deloitte. ""It took a high price to induce the change.""
Yet consumer companies cannot take demand for granted and can be burnt by raising prices. 
Prices for bottled water and disposable diapers have gone up, while demand has fallen for most of the pandemic. People are unwilling to pay out extra when they can drink their own water at home, and can opt for reusable or cheaper generic diapers at a time when there's a lack of child daycare, some economists say.
""You're at home anyway so you're not sending your child off somewhere in a diaper that fails,"" said Rao.

A $2,245 COAT, ANYONE?
Lockdowns have meant many Americans do not travel, eat out, or go to movie theaters. As they have not been commuting or taking kids to school, many are using less gas in their cars.
So they can now splash out on other things, perhaps.
Michael Collins, a professor at the University of Wisconsin's consumer science department, calls this a ""substitution effect.""
""It's pretty clear people behave as if they have different pots of money,"" he said. ""Now I don't eat out at all, so I have a couple of hundred dollars of new income not allocated to anything. I can substitute that money away from eating out and treat myself to other things."" 
This effect could help explain the rise in demand and prices for the Air Max. Nike sold about 63% of their online stocks of the shoes in July, compared with only 10% a year earlier, according to apparel data company StyleSage which collects sales information from brand websites. 
Air Max prices surged 10.5% on average versus a year before. 
Prices for Lululemon's yoga pants rose 7.2%, and about 45% of stocks were sold in July versus 15% the year before. 
Meanwhile, the price of Louis Vuitton's Neverfull MM Monogram handbag has risen 5% on its website since the start of May. In July, Louis Vuitton owner LVMH said sales momentum had picked up since June, even as its star label raised prices for a third time during the pandemic.
There are some limits, though.
Demand for a Burberry (L:BRBY) woman's trench coat has declined, with only 3% of online stocks sold in July versus 14% a year earlier. 
It's a snip at $2,245, down 3.5%. 
Nike and Burberry did not respond to requests for comment, while LVMH declined to comment beyond its July remarks. Lululemon said it hadn't raised prices on some of its core yoga pant styles, including Align (NASDAQ:ALGN) and Wunder Under, but had seen a significant rise in demand for yoga products since April. The strong July sales reflected its ""Warehouse Sale"" offer that month, it added. 
Graphic: Nike Air Max, Lululemon legging discount levels go down this year - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/yzdvxxaozvx/Apparel%20prices%20discount%20levels.png
HOW LONG WILL IT LAST?
Much remains uncertain. 
The U.S. epidemic and its economic consequences are moving targets, and it is unclear when - or even if - American life and consumer behavior will revert to ""normal"".
The University of Michigan's Rao said food producers had been reluctant to invest in permanent changes to retool factories. ""They're hindered by the fact there's so much uncertainty as to how long this will last.""
Indeed, consumer demand, as well as brands' pricing power, could change in the coming weeks and months as many Americans feel more financial pain.
The government's first round of COVID-19-related benefits expired on July 31, leaving about 30 million unemployed Americans without the $600 weekly boost that sustained their households and promoted some discretionary spending. 
With the money spigot turned off, analysts say recessionary spending behavior should take hold, with consumers cutting back.
The University of Wisconsin's Collins said loan forbearance on mortgages, credit cards and student loans since the spring had also helped consumers.

""Eventually that will all end, and people could start to tighten up again.""

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are set to open the new month higher on Tuesday, continuing the positive tone seen the previous month, with investors remaining bullish after the Federal Reserve’s policy shift.
At 7:10 AM ET (1110 GMT), S&P 500 Futures traded 10 points, or 0.3%, higher, the Dow Futures contract rose 13 points, or 0.1%, while Nasdaq 100 Futures climbed 120 points, or 1%. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed Monday 0.8% lower, while posting its best August performance since 1984. The S&P 500 index fell 0.2%, but gained more than 7% for the month to notch its best August since 1986. The Nasdaq Composite index gained 0.7%, posting gains of nearly 10% in the month, for its best monthly gain since 2000.
The Federal Reserve has continued to pound its message that the economy will continue to benefit from an accommodative monetary policy for the foreseeable future. This follows Thursday’s change in the way the central bank approaches inflation and unemployment, the two pillars of its policy mandate. 
The central bank will not raise interest rates just because the unemployment rate is falling, the Fed’s vice chairman, Richard Clarida, said Monday.
Fed Governor Lael Brainard is scheduled to comment about the bank's monetary policy shift later Tuesday at the Brookings Institution. 
The key economic release Tuesday will be the August ISM manufacturing PMI, at 10 AM ET (1400 GMT), which is expected to show a small increase to 54.5, from 54.2 in July, suggesting the important manufacturing sector is still recovering.
In corporate news,  Zoom Video Communications  (NASDAQ:ZM) is likely to be in focus after the popular videconferencing app posted blowout second-quarter results after the close Monday, helped by the work-from-home movement.
Additionally, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is likely to be in demand after Bloomberg reported that the iPhone maker had asked suppliers to build at least 75 million 5G iPhones for later this year, around the levels of last year, suggesting demand is holding up for this key product.
Oil prices pushed higher Tuesday, helped by the dollar slumping to its lowest in more than two years, and by signs of manufacturing growth in the likes of China and Germany.
Later Tuesday, investors will look to the American Petroleum Institute’s figures on U.S. oil supply, although these could reflect the disruptions to the market from last week's hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
U.S. crude futures traded 1.2% higher at $43.11 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract rose 1.2% to $45.84.

LONDON (Reuters) - Lloyd's of London reopened its underwriting floor for the first time in nearly six months on Tuesday, with the first day back marked by a protest over the underwriting of coal and tar sands.
The COVID-19 pandemic triggered the first shutdown in the history of the 330-year old commercial insurance market's ""underwriting room"" in mid-March.
Brokers and underwriters met in the room to agree complex insurance deals, covering anything from oil rigs to footballers' legs.
Industry sources say the enforced working from home has catapulted Lloyd's towards greater use of electronic trading, although some trades still require face to face contact.
""The tacit knowledge exchange that comes from being together is crucial to that ability to trade risks the rest of the world can't,"" Christopher Croft, CEO of insurance broker trade body LIIBA, said.
""Insure Our Future"" protesters outside the building, meanwhile, said Lloyd's has one of the worst climate records among global insurers. 
Lloyd's is insuring the proposed Adani Carmichael mine in Australia and the Trans Mountain tar sands pipeline in Canada.
Lloyd's said it did not set underwriting policy for its 90-plus syndicate members but was ""committed to building consensus"" among members to drive the transition to a low-carbon economy.
The transition back-to-office work involves yellow signs on the Lloyd's floor indicating a one-way system and plastic screens between desks.
Visitors are banned, and brokers and underwriters will only be allocated floor time for a day or two a week, depending on the type of insurance they write. 
The floor has a maximum capacity of 45% of its previous occupancy, and glass lifts visible on the outside of the market's City tower will take at most three people.
The building's barber shop and cafe will stay closed.
Lloyd's is also piloting a virtual underwriting room, which it said would be open to a greater number of firms later this year.
Insurers and brokers are also returning to work across the City of London this month. 
Broker Gallagher said its London office would open on Sept. 21, although regional offices were already open, and brokers could meet clients at Lloyd's before then. 
Insurer  Aviva  (LON:AV), said only 5% of its staff were at the office nationwide but it expected that to double to 10% in September, and increase further from October.

A survey by tech firm Culture Shift showed 62% of insurance employees found working from home had improved their work-life balance, with nearly half ""dreading going back to the workplace"".

Investing.com -- One of Europe’s most high-profile incubators for startups is abandoning the stock market.
 Rocket Internet  (DE:RKET), which can count online fashion house Zalando (DE:ZALG), Delivery Hero (DE:DHER) and meal kit company HelloFresh (DE:HFGG) among its success stories, said on Tuesday it will delist from the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, saying it didn’t need public investors any more, thank you very much.
“The significance of capital markets as a financing source has diminished,” it said in a statement. “A delisting will permit Rocket Internet to pursue a long-term approach in its strategic decisions.”
It added that “adequate access to capital is secured outside the stock exchange.”
It had better be. The Samwer brothers haven’t made many friends among retail investors in the six years since they listed Rocket: the shares that listed at 42.50 euros are now worth only 44% of that (share buybacks in the last couple of years mean that total returns are somewhat less awful than the share price alone indicates).
Normally, founders take their listed companies private when they think they are undervalued, demonstrating their conviction by offering a premium to the prevailing price. The Samwers, by contrast, are offering 18.57 euros a share, 2% below Monday’s close. A clearer one-fingered salute to free shareholders is hard to imagine.
Short-term financial pressures on its remaining portfolio companies – almost all of which are still loss-making – appear likely to have played a significant role. Rocket had already swung to a loss in the first quarter after having to slash the valuation of its portfolio in response to the first wave of the virus. Although the market has treated many loss-making startups indulgently since then (even going so far as to propel Delivery Hero into the Dax), Rocket’s last update hinted heavily that some of its investments wouldn’t survive the downturn.  
The Samwers made a point of building Rocket around copycat sites – Zalando, its best-known project, was based on Zappos.com while HelloFresh and Delivery Hero were modelled on the likes of Blue Apron (NYSE:APRN) and GrubHub (NYSE:GRUB). Consequently, a bet on Rocket was always more of a bet on the Samwers’ ability to execute, rather than on their vision.
The 50% drop in the share price over six years suggests that they have been found wanting on that score.  Even allowing for the nature of venture capital, a business that requires regular exits before an investment develops its full potential, the operational performance and the share price performance of HelloFresh, Delivery Hero and Zalando have improved conspicuously as Rocket withdrew from them. That suggests a little more than just unfortunate timing on behalf of the venture capitalist.
Likewise, the failure of one of its biggest holdings, Global Fashion Group, to turn a profit, and the inability even of  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) to make a success of e-commerce platform Lazada since buying it also point to deeper-rooted problems with the Samwer model.
Shareholders can console themselves that – by taking one last modest hit -  they won’t have to worry about it for much longer."
523,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 01, 2020 05:50AM ET</span>","No regrets, says Norway's new oil fund boss, after costly job switch","OSLO (Reuters) - It's cost him more than $1 billion and he's moved into a higher tax bracket, but hedge fund veteran Nicolai Tangen said on Tuesday he had no regrets about giving up his old job to manage Norway's oil fund.
Arriving by electric scooter on his first day, Tangen declined to say what might change as he took charge of the country's $1.2 trillion of national savings after months of public scrutiny of his private wealth and connections.
""I intend to tell you in due course, when I've sat down with the new management team,"" he told independent broadcaster TV2.
Tangen's appointment to manage Norges Bank Investment Management (NBIM), which runs the world's largest sovereign wealth fund - owning 1.5% of globally listed stocks and vast portfolios of bonds and real estate - was announced in March.
News that he would become a civil servant in charge of NBIM while maintaining a 43% stake in London-based hedge fund AKO Capital, set off a political storm in Norway over potential conflict of interest.
Forced by parliament to choose between his life's work - AKO - and what he said was his dream job, Tangen last week agreed to donate his AKO stake to a charitable foundation, clearing the path to the oil fund position.
Tangen estimated the value of his forfeited hedge fund holdings at some 10 billion crowns (850.18 million pounds). He also agreed to sell off private investments, and said that left him with about 7 billion crowns in cash in personal bank accounts.
""I want to be CEO of the oil fund, and have only one objective: creating wealth for future generations,"" the 54-year-old said at the time.
His new job pays 6.65 million crowns ($760,000) a year and he is contracted to serve a five-year term, renewable once, and work the Norwegian standard of 37-1/2 hours per week.
While the salary is high compared with most public positions, Tangen will be paying far more in annual wealth tax after moving back to his native Norway from Britain.

Saving petroleum revenue for future generations, the fund owns stakes in 9,200 companies and has grown from nothing in 1996 to a value of around three times that of Norway's annual gross domestic product, or $217,000 for each Norwegian.

(Reuters) - AstraZeneca (NYSE:AZN) has expanded its agreement with cell therapy firm Oxford Biomedica to mass-produce its COVID-19 potential vaccine, as it looks to scale-up supply ahead of a possible U.S. fast-track approval. 
While the British drugmaker works on the widely watched coronavirus vaccine hopeful, AZD1222, its main portfolio of treatments for cancer, diabetes and heart diseases scored a win after its drug, Imfinzi, was approved for use in Europe to treat an aggressive form of lung cancer.
The company's shares gained as much as 1.5% to trade at 84.6 pounds by 0807 GMT, outperforming the benchmark FTSE-100 index, after Oxford Biomedica announced the expanded agreement and on news of the EU approval for Imfinzi.
Cambridge-based AstraZeneca's vaccine is among the leading candidates in the global race for a successful vaccine and it has entered late-stage trials in the United States, the company said on Monday, as it targets 3 billion doses of the vaccine, globally. 
Oxford Biomedica said in a statement that AstraZeneca would give it 15 million pounds ($20 million) upfront to reserve manufacturing capacity at Oxford Biomedica's plant and that it could get an additional 35 million pounds under a new 18-month deal. 
The company was spun off in 1995 from the University of Oxford, which developed the vaccine before licensing it to AstraZeneca in April. 
It was among AstraZeneca's initial partners when they teamed up to produce the vaccine and focus on UK and European supply. Tuesday's deal could be expanded further by another 18 months into 2022 and 2023, Oxford Biomedica said, sending its share price up 2.1% to 862 pence. 
""Our previously announced partnership with the UK's Vaccine Manufacturing Innovation Centre (VMIC) has supported our ability to make additional facilities available for this supply agreement,"" said Oxford Biomedica's Chief Executive John Dawson.
The company, however, did not specify how many doses of AstraZeneca's vaccine it expects to produce under the expanded deal, which is for ""large-scale commercial manufacture,"" according to its statement.

(The story corrects para 3 to say EU (not U.S.) approval for Imfinzi.)

Maersk, which handles about one in five containers shipped worldwide, has been under pressure from investors to speed its transformation from an unwieldy conglomerate but has proved resilient in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Cost cuts and its reinstatement of more upbeat guidance last month have helped to double its share price since March and the shares were trading 0.9% up at 9,652 crowns by 0835 GMT.
The company sold its oil and gas assets in 2017 to  Total  (PA:TOTF) as part of its efforts to become a more streamlined company focused on its container and in-land logistics business for large customers such as Walmart (N:WMT) and  Nike  (N:NKE).
Under the shake-up, its Damco freight-forwarding business and Africa-focused carrier Safmarine will be integrated into Maersk by the end of the year and their brands will cease to exist, Maersk said in a statement on Tuesday.
""Simplifying the organisation will regrettably impact jobs due to duplicate roles and roles that will no longer be needed,"" Chief Commercial Officer Vincent Clerc said earlier in an internal email sent to Maersk employees and seen by Reuters. 
A Maersk spokeswoman said that between 26,000 and 27,000 employees out of Maersk's total headcount of 80,000 will be affected by the restructuring.
The company did not say how many would be laid off and the internal email also gave no detail on the number of job cuts.
Hamburg Sud, which Maersk bought in 2016, will remain a separate brand but its back office will be rolled into that of Maersk, the company said.
The Hamburg Sud unit employs 4,500 people while Damco and Safmarine have 2,300 and 1,100 staff respectively, according to Maersk.

In a complaint seeking up to $1 billion of damages, the plaintiffs said McDonald's has not offered profitable restaurant locations and growth opportunities to Black franchisees on the same terms as white franchisees, belying its public commitment to diversity and Black entrepreneurship.
In a statement on early on Tuesday, McDonald's denied the charges that the franchisees were unable to succeed due to discrimination.
""We are confident that the facts will show how committed we are to the diversity and equal opportunity of the McDonald's System, including across our franchisees, suppliers and employees"", the statement added. 
The complaint said McDonald's saddled the plaintiffs under its standard 20-year franchise agreements with stores requiring high security and insurance costs, and whose $2 million average annual sales from 2011 to 2016 were $700,000 below the nationwide norm. Bankruptcy often resulted, they said.
""It's systematic placement in substandard locations, because they're Black,"" the plaintiffs' lawyer Jim Ferraro said in a phone interview. ""Revenue at McDonald's is governed by one thing only: location.""
The plaintiffs are suing in Chicago federal court five weeks after McDonald's updated its corporate values, pledging a greater focus on diversity.
Chief Executive Chris Kempczinski told CNBC in June that diversity was ""critically important"" and needed to touch ""every single aspect"" of its business.
He also defended McDonald's record, saying the Chicago-based company had ""created more millionaires within the Black community than probably any other corporation on the planet, but there's still work to do.""
Ferraro called that claim ""total hogwash,"" saying the number of Black franchisees has fallen to 186 from 377 since 1998.
More than 90% of McDonald's 14,400 U.S. restaurants were recently operated by about 1,600 franchisees.
The company updated its values before suing ousted Chief Executive Steve Easterbrook to recoup his estimated $41.8 million severance package for allegedly concealing improper sexual relationships with three employees.

Easterbrook said the lawsuit is ""meritless.""

As Donald Trump threatened to ban the U.S. operations of the hit app TikTok, Chinese parent ByteDance Ltd.’s choices seemed to be limited to selling the business for $20 billion to $30 billion or leaving empty-handed.
But after China signaled it will get involved in any deal’s approval, ByteDance founder Zhang Yiming is reconsidering his options and weighing the implications of Beijing’s involvement, according to people familiar with the matter. The company’s regulatory team and deal negotiators are huddling to discuss whether it’s still possible to craft a sale that can win approval from both governments, an acquirer, venture investors and ByteDance itself, said one of the people, asking not to be named because the matter is private.
 Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT). and  Oracle Corp  (NYSE:ORCL). have been deep in negotiations to buy TikTok U.S., submitting proposals while seeking reassurances from Washington that the Trump administration would bless their purchases. Microsoft is working on its bid with Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc., while Oracle has won support from venture backers such as Sequoia Capital.
But Beijing’s last-minute entry into the process raises the odds that Zhang will hold on to the U.S. operation beyond the stated American deadlines or even back out of a deal altogether. It’s likely the need for approval in Washington and Beijing -- along with the already complex negotiations -- will push any final deal beyond the November elections in the U.S. in any case, a person familiar with the matter has said.
“I’m not sure price matters as much as pride,” said Rebecca Fannin, author of Tech Titans of China, and founder of Silicon Dragon Ventures. “From the start, Zhang wanted to build a global company. Without the U.S. market, he can’t fulfill those ambitions. He’s a maverick, fiercely independent-minded entrepreneur. He may just decide not to do the deal at all.”
China Throws a Wrench Into Trump’s Plan to Force TikTok Sale
Talks are fluid and it’s still possible Zhang will proceed with a sale, the people said. He could also negotiate a deal with an acquirer, then not complete the transaction because of government demands.
The 37-year-old coder-by-training is something of a lone wolf in China’s tech industry, refusing to take money from rainmakers Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) Ltd. or  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd. He endured a succession of crackdowns yet managed to groom Douyin, TikTok’s Chinese cousin, into a rising internet star in the country. A fighter by nature, Zhang has several reasons to resist a TikTok sale in the clash with Trump.
He and his company don’t need the money. Privately held ByteDance is already worth $140 billion, according to startup tracker CB Insights, and is said to have generated more than $3 billion of net profit on more than $17 billion of revenue in 2019. Investment bankers had begun pitching Zhang’s team on going public in China or Hong Kong, even amid growing scrutiny in the U.S.
Local demand for initial public offerings from technology companies is white-hot, with first-time share sales likely to surpass the heights of the dot-com bubble. Zhang stands to make billions no matter what happens with Trump.
Just as important, if he sells the U.S. business, he can never get it back. Zhang would be relinquishing control over an asset that boasts upwards of a 100 million users in the U.S. and is on the cusp of monetizing that base. If TikTok gets banned in the U.S., the immediate outcome is it vanishes from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) app stores and software updates halt. Depending on how the U.S. Commerce Dept. defines Trump’s executive order, the sanctions could also cut off TikTok’s access to the local cloud services vital to maintaining data and streaming service.
But industrious American teens can still side-load the app, working around domestic restrictions to get software from abroad. In the meantime, TikTok can keep operating in the rest of the world (apart from India, where it is already banned) and build up the business further. It also leaves open the possibility of re-entering the U.S. if political dynamics change.
Separately, ByteDance is taking advantage of U.S. courts to see if it can stall Trump’s ban. Come November, there could be a new administration in power that may not regard shuttering TikTok as a high priority, not when the U.S. economy is reeling and Washington battles Beijing on a number of other geopolitical fronts from the South China Sea to trade and Taiwan.
“Zhang is betting on a court injunction to get the case past deadline and hopefully even past the Trump presidency,” said Xiaomeng Lu, a senior analyst, geo-technology for the Eurasia Group. “His last hope is that the U.S. legal system still functions as a guard rail when the white house malfunctions.”
Beijing’s involvement could end up benefiting Zhang. China’s assertion that its regulators will weigh in on any TikTok asset sale could give Zhang a possible out, said Ding Chenling, a tech entrepreneur who said he has known the ByteDance founder for a half-decade. It could take up to 30 days for Beijing to greenlight ByteDance’s application to sell tech to a foreign acquirer, which means it may well pass Trump’s target for banning TikTok.
“He thought that by making a promise to follow international standards or rules he would be able to escape the regulation or the kind of pressure from the American government,” said Ding. “But I think now he realizes he might have been wrong and that if he doesn’t want to sell the company, the only one who can help him is the Chinese government -- which is what he’s tried to avoid the past few years.”

The company expects to raise 20 million euros ($24 million) from selling new shares, it said in a statement Tuesday. The offering also will include a sale by Knaus Tabbert’s owners, Dutch investors Wim de Pundert and Klaas Meertens. Knaus Tabbert didn’t provide details on the size of this portion of the offering but said it aims to have about 50% of its shares available for trading.
Bloomberg News reported last month that the company had started gauging investor demand for a potential listing. Knaus Tabbert is seeking to take advantage of surging demand for camper vans in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic.
The pipeline of German deals is steadily expanding. KKR & Co. is speaking to fund managers about a listing of defense supplier Hensoldt, Bloomberg reported last month, while Auto1 Group GmbH, the German online used-car marketplace, is also ramping up preparations for a planned IPO, Bloomberg reported last week.
Only three companies have listed on German exchanges this year, raising about $364 million, a massive drop from the more than $4 billion raised in same period in 2019, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Volatile markets and the economic impact of the coroanvirus pandemic cramped new listing activity for much of the year, but rallying equity indexes have reopened the market to companies benefiting from, or immune, to virus-induced lockdowns.
HTP Investments, run by De Pundert and Meertens, bought Knaus Tabbert in 2009 and the two men own about 97% of its shares. The company, based in Jandelsbrunn in southeastern Germany, makes recreational vehicles under brands including Knaus, Tabbert and Morelo.
It generated about 780 million euros of revenue in the 2019 with a compound annual growth rate of nearly 15% between 2017 and 2019, according to the statement.
Jefferies (NYSE:JEF), Unicredit (MI:CRDI) and ABN Amro are arranging the offering.

529,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 01, 2020 05:05AM ET</span>","Betting on Asia's debt, Europe's hunt for yield heads east","By Tom Westbrook and Yoruk Bahceli
SINGAPORE/AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Low yields at home are sending some previously shy European investors into Asia's credit markets, money managers say, lured by the promise of higher returns and a hope that rebounding economies can hold defaults at bay.
Unlike in Europe or the United States, Asia's central banks have not stepped in to put a floor under corporate debt prices. That has the market's recovery in Asia trailing the rest of the world.
""Now people are looking for the valuation gap to close,"" said Hayden Briscoe, head of Asia-Pacific fixed income at UBS Asset Management.
Starting with family offices, then private banks, flows from Italy, Germany, Switzerland and the United Kingdom have broadened over the past few months, he said.
""I don't think it's slowing down,"" he said. ""We haven't had a day of outflows, it's just been continuous.""
Like elsewhere Asia's junk bond spreads, the premium over safer assets that buyers demand for riskier debt, have narrowed sharply since March.
But Asian high yield <.MERADHY> still offers a rich 686 basis points over safe-haven benchmarks, which is at least 200 basis points more than what European (MERHE00) or U.S. (MERH0A0) junk debt offers.
At the same time Asia's economies, especially China which dominates the region's $260 billion high-yield market, are emerging in better shape from the coronavirus crisis.
Asia is the only region Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) Asset Management says it expects to grow this year, and as a consequence, it forecasts junk default rates at 4% compared to 8% in the United States for 2020.
""When you have a market that is giving you sufficient yield and is not necessarily any more risky, it becomes a market that people at least have to look at,"" said Elizabeth Allen, head of credit research, Asia-Pacific at HSBC Global Asset Management.
""Rather than just - 'Oh this is Asia, I don't know about it, never mind about it' - that mindset is rapidly changing.""
(Graphic: Asian corporate debt sits at attractive levels, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/xlbvgljkjpq/asian%20high%20yield.png) 
 BEST  (NYSE:BEST) IN CLASS
Along with the asset management arms of UBS, HSBC and Goldman, J.P. Morgan Asset Management, Pictet Wealth Management and  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) are among advisors to sound upbeat on Asian credit.
Goldman Sachs Asset Management, like UBS-AM's Briscoe and HSBC Global Asset Management's Allen, told Reuters it has noticed demand from Europe lately.
Beyond the economic factors, the composition of Asia's debt market is another attraction, investors say, because exposure to sectors hardest hit by the virus - such as energy, travel and other cyclicals - is lower than in Europe or the United States.
""The dominant sector is really the Chinese property names,"" said Tiansi Wang, Senior Credit Analyst at Dutch fund manager Robeco in Hong Kong, adding the well-capitalised industry is driven by supportive domestic factors.
""That makes a big part of Asia's high-yield market run low-correlation with the global high-yield market,"" she said.
To be sure, Asia is still home to plenty of risky companies vulnerable to going broke and burning their bondholders.
U.S. and European investment in Asian bonds comprises only about 16% of the total, according to J.P. Morgan Asset Management.
But interest in recent deals such as last week's nearly 13-times oversubscribed Tencent Music's (N:TME) $800 million debt sale, of which about two-thirds went to EMEA and U.S. buyers, suggests at the very least a more receptive audience abroad.
""We expect the region's positive growth trajectory, highly-supportive policies and the global grab for yield to continue to sustain demand for Asian dollar credits,"" said Shaw Yann Ho, head of Asia fixed income at J.P. Morgan Asset Management.

Factory activity in China expanded at the fastest rate in nearly a decade in August, a private PMI survey showed on Tuesday, contrasting with an official survey on Monday that showed output in the country's factories grew slightly more slowly last month as floods hit the southwest.
Both surveys pointed to improving export orders.
The MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 49 countries, was close to its highest ever, while the pan-European Stoxx 600 was up 0.2% at 0809 GMT.
France's Cac 40 was up 0.4% and Germany's Dax was up 0.6%. Britain's FTSE 100 lagged, down 0.9%.
European stocks had opened even higher but pared gains after the German government revised down its GDP forecast for 2021.
PMI data from across Europe showed manufacturing activity generally on the path to recovery though factory managers are wary about investing and hiring more workers.
In Germany, Europe's largest economy, output grew at its fastest pace since February 2018, while in France it contracted.
The euro zone economy has experienced a strong recovery in the third quarter even though the most recent incoming data have been less robust, European Central Bank Vice President Luis de Guindos said.
The euro rose to a two-year highs of $1.19975 at 0324 GMT. At 0800 GMT it was at $1.199, up 0.4% since New York's close, as a dollar sell-off continued.
Versus a basket of currencies the dollar was down 0.4% at 91.8811 at 0810 GMT, dropping below 92 for the first time since May 2018. 
Investors are betting on U.S. rates staying lower for longer after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Thursday outlined an accommodative shift in the central bank's approach to inflation.
Euro zone inflation data for August is due at 0900 GMT and is expected to show a decline to 0.2%, according to a Reuters poll.
Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) analyst Esther Reichelt said inflation data highlights the difference between the Fed and the ECB.
""Whereas the market considers the Fed capable of rekindling inflation rates by leaving interest rates lower for longer than previously assumed, this does no longer seem to be the case as far as the ECB is concerned,"" she wrote in a note to clients.
""Inflation data for August published today will once again underline by how much the ECB will miss its inflation target.
""Just as higher inflation is damaging for the dollar, the euro is benefiting from lower inflation – if monetary policy is unwilling (or unable) to do anything against it.""
Paul Donovan, chief economist at UBS Global Wealth Management said Tuesday's data was likely to have limited impact because ""markets are convinced interest rates will remain low for longer, and price data is unlikely to change that.""
Core euro zone bond yields were up around 1 to 2 basis points, with the benchmark German 10-year yield at -0.386%.
Oil prices gained, reversing overnight losses.
Brent crude futures climbed 57 cents to $45.85 a barrel at 0805 GMT. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures rose 56 cents to $43.17 a barrel.

Gold prices also rose, to their highest in two weeks.

LONDON (Reuters) -  Citigroup  (N:C) has hired Robin Rousseau as a vice chairman of investment banking for Europe, the Middle East and Africa, a memo seen by Reuters shows.
Based in Paris, Rousseau will focus on the bank's French client franchise while also providing financial advisory across the region. 
A 26-year industry veteran, Rousseau was  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn)'s former M&A boss for EMEA and also worked at  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS) and Goldman Sachs (N:GS).
In his new role, he will seek to enhance Citi's strategic client coverage and help companies identify opportunities despite a difficult backdrop, with French M&A down 40% this year due to the coronavirus crisis.
Rousseau will report to Philip Drury who runs Citi's banking, capital markets and advisory business across EMEA.

His appointment comes after the recent departure of Maja Torun, who was Citi's co-head of France investment banking and left in April to take on a similar job at JPMorgan (N:JPM).

(Reuters) - Technology stocks drove European shares higher on Tuesday, but sentiment was shaky ahead of key economic readings that are likely to indicate an uneven recovery from the coronavirus.
Apple (O:AAPL) suppliers in the region rose after the iPhone maker was reported to have asked suppliers to make at least 75 million 5G phones for later this year, propping up the technology index (SX8P).
STMicroelectronics (PA:STM), Dialog Semiconductor (DE:DLGS), Infineon (OTC:IFNNY) Technologies (DE:IFXGn) and ASML (AS:ASML) were up between 1.6% and 4%.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index (STOXX) rose 0.7%, taking some support from better-than-expected Chinese manufacturing data. China-sensitive sectors such as basic resources (SXPP) and automobiles (SXAP) rose about 1% each.
Despite a 2.9% gain in August, the benchmark index still lagged its Wall Street peers. Signs of a stalling economic recovery have put the STOXX 600 in a tight trading range since June.
Data later in the day is expected to show European inflation declining from the prior month, raising concerns over the deflationary effects of the pandemic. Unlike its peers, the European Central Bank has fewer tools left to bring up inflation to its target range.
""The market considers the U.S. Federal Reserve capable of rekindling inflation rates by leaving interest rates lower for longer than previously assumed, this does no longer seem to be the case as far as the ECB is concerned,"" Esther Reichelt, FX & EM Analyst at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG), wrote in a note.
""Inflation data for August ... will once again underline by how much the ECB will miss its inflation target.""
Manufacturing data, due later, is also expected to show a slowdown in the Euro zone's recovery from the pandemic.
 Telecom Italia  (MI:TLIT) rose 1.1% after its board approved a sale of a minority stake in its last-mile grid to U.S. investment firm KKR (N:KKR), while endorsing a government plan to create a single ultrafast network with rival Open Fiber.

British pharmaceutical major AstraZeneca (L:AZN) rose about 1% after its Imfinzi was approved in the European Union to treat an aggressive form of lung cancer in previously untreated adult patients.

Investing.com - European stock markets traded largely higher Tuesday, with the exception of the U.K. market playing catch up after Monday’s holiday, helped by signs of economic recovery in China and ahead of key local data.
At 3:40 AM ET (0740 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 1.4% higher, the CAC 40 in France rose 0.9%, while the U.K.'s FTSE index was down 0.2%.
Helping the tone Tuesday was the news that China's factory activity expanded at the fastest pace in nearly a decade in August, suggesting that the world's second-biggest economy, and a major export market for Europe’s companies, could be seeing a durable recovery from the Covid-inspired downturn.
The Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index rose to 53.1 last month from July's 52.8, marking the sector's fourth consecutive month of growth and the fastest rate of expansion since January 2011.
The focus will now turn to European economic data, with markets awaiting local manufacturing and inflation readings for August. Both data sets are expected to show a slight decline from the prior month, less impressive than the Chinese numbers, as areas within Europe had to reinstate social distancing measures due to local outbreaks of the Covid-19 virus.
That said, reports indicate the German government will upwardly revise their estimates of the economy, which initially called for a 6.3% contraction in 2020.

Lagardere (PA:LAGA) dropped 0.7% amid a potential legal battle with its two largest shareholders, French media conglomerate  Vivendi  (PA:VIV) and activist fund Amber Capital, over boardroom representation.
Oil prices pushed higher Tuesday, helped by weakness in the U.S. dollar which makes commodities priced in the greenback more attractive to overseas buyers.
The dollar hit its lowest in more than two years earlier Tuesday as investors continue to digest the previous week’s policy shift on inflation announced by the U.S. Federal Reserve.

Telecom providers in India pay the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) nearly 3-5% of their adjusted gross revenue (AGR) in usage charges for spectrum or airwaves and 8% of AGR as licence fees, but they have been at odds on the definition of AGR.
The decision would provide some respite to embattled  Vodafone  (NASDAQ:VOD) Idea Ltd (NS:VODA), a joint venture between Britain's Vodafone Group Plc (L:VOD) and India's  Idea Cellular  , even though it had asked the court for 15 years to complete payments.
The Supreme Court, however, asked that telecoms firms pay 10% of the dues owed by March 31, 2021.
Vodafone Idea, seen as the most vulnerable if the court did not allow for staggered payments, has so far paid 78.54 billion Indian rupees ($1.08 billion), but still owes roughly 500 billion to the government.
 Bharti Airtel  (NS:BRTI) has said it has paid its complete dues of 180 billion rupees on the basis of self-assessment, but still needs to pay another 259.76 billion rupees, according to government calculations.

The main stock index remained on course to cap its longest run of monthly gains since December.
A gauge of implied stock volatility surged after the announcement and the S&P BSE Sensex slipped 0.8% to 39,166.6 at 1:02 p.m. The measure’s 19% gain since June hasn’t been bettered since the six-month streak through August 2016 and the net $6.4 billion of India stocks bought by foreigners this month is set for the biggest monthly purchase in a decade. The NSE Nifty 50 Index fell 0.6%.
“Investors had put the geo-political tensions on the back burner, and it is now back into focus,” said Sameer Kalra, a strategist at Mumbai-based  Target  (NYSE:TGT) Investing. “Markets will be closely watching for signs of escalation.”
The latest military skirmish -- on Saturday -- follows a stand-off along the contested Himalayan border since May. Both India and China have moved thousands of troops, tanks, artillery guns and fighter jets close to the area.

Geely showed off its first pickup truck model last week at a company event publicised on social media, while official documents showed a joint venture of carmakers including GM seeking approval to build its first pickup truck model.
The companies are trying to tap into the niche market, which still accounts for less than 2% of overall vehicle sales in China, but that has outperformed as local governments ease restrictions on their entry into urban areas.
China sold around 251,000 pickup trucks in the first seven months of 2020, according to the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM). That represented a 1.4% fall from the same period last year, but was more modest than the 12.7% slump in overall vehicle sales over that period.
Documents on the website of China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology showed a joint venture between GM, state-owned SAIC Motor (SS:600104) and Guangxi Automobile Group seeking government approval to build its first pickup truck model Zhengtu.
Meanwhile, Geely is building a vehicle plant which will have an annual manufacturing capacity of 100,000 vehicles, including pickup trucks, in China's eastern city of Zibo, construction bidding documents on the company website showed.
Geely and GM representatives declined any further comment.
The plans come as pickup trucks sales are gathering pace compared to some of its peers. 
Great Wall Motor, China's largest pickup manufacturer, saw pickup sales surge 38% in the first seven months of 2020 versus last year due to its new P-series models.
By comparison, the sales of sport-utility vehicles and of sedans fell 11% and 22% respectively over that period.
But Cui Dongshu, secretary general at China Passenger Car Association (CPCA), does not expect any significant jump in sales over the long term even if government curbs ease further.

""There is still a lack of demand for pickup trucks from normal Chinese customers,"" he said. ""They are more familiar with SUVs and sedans.""

542,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 01, 2020 12:10AM ET</span>",More resignations at Singapore firm linked to Newcastle United bidders,"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Several directors resigned from a Singaporean firm linked to bidders for soccer club Newcastle United on Tuesday, the latest hiatus for the bidding group since Reuters reported doctored photos of Barack Obama were among various suspect claims it had made.
The resignations from consultancy Axington (SI:AXIN), owned by Singaporean cousins Terence and Nelson Loh, included its chairman, Chinese jeweller Evangeline Shen, according to filings with the exchange.
The Lohs and Shen are the co-founders of newly formed Bellagraph Nova Group (BN Group), which said last month it was in advanced talks to buy Newcastle. It has described itself as a ""conglomerate"" with turnover last year of $12 billion.
The board exits follow the former U.S. ambassador to Singapore's decision to quit the firm as its stock price sank last week and came as the company said it plans to make ""strategic changes"" in its ""business direction"".
Reuters reported on Aug 22 that BN Group had admitted to doctoring photos of former U.S. President Obama in marketing materials and had released other information about the group prematurely or in error.
Local Singapore media subsequently reported other inconsistencies in claims made on the group's website, press releases and social media posts, which the firm said ""appears to be the result of the actions of certain errant individuals"".
Many of those press releases have since been deleted, its social media accounts have been deactivated and a password is now required to view BN Group's website.
In other recent developments, luxury jewellery brand Bulgari (PA:LVMH) has refuted the group's claims of a business association, and Singapore's Business Times newspaper reported some regional investors were trying to withdraw investments from other BN group entities.
BN Group did not immediately respond to a request seeking comment. It was quoted by the Straits Times newspaper saying it will appoint independent legal counsel to investigate the posting of the marketing material and will not address any further media queries until investigations are completed.
The Singapore Exchange (OTC:SPXCY)'s regulatory arm last week called for a probe of Axington's directors ""in light of recent developments"", shortly before the company postponed a shareholder meeting saying it needed time to review its plans.
At that meeting, shareholders had been due to vote on switching Axington's business to medical services and robotics, and change its name to NETX, a firm that BN Group had heavily marketed as one of its entities.
Also among Tuesday's four resignations was executive director Marjory Loh, Terence Loh's sister, who cited ""recent intense public scrutiny on the company"" for stepping down, according to filings with the Singapore Exchange.

A spokeswoman for Singapore's corporate regulator ACRA has also said it is taking enforcement action on two other companies linked to the Lohs for not filing annual returns.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Walmart Inc (N:WMT) on Tuesday unveiled the perks of its new membership program, Walmart Plus, which will grant subscribers unlimited free delivery, fuel discounts and no checkout lines.
Touted as a rival to Amazon.com Inc's (O:AMZN) Prime subscription, Walmart's new loyalty program will cost $98 a year or $12.95 a month. It will become available to all U.S.-based customers on Sept. 15.
Amazon Prime, which offers U.S. shoppers fast shipping, streaming video and other services, costs $119 a year or $12.99 a month.
""We are a company committed to meeting our customers' needs,"" said Janey Whiteside, chief customer officer at Walmart. ""We've designed this program as the ultimate life hack for them.""
The service aims to both attract new customers and turn existing ones into even more loyal shoppers, Whiteside said.
Members will have access to same-day delivery on more than 160,000 items from toys to groceries. To qualify, orders must be at least $35. 
Walmart was already offering a similar service called ""Delivery Unlimited,"" which allowed an unlimited number of deliveries for a yearly or monthly fee. Members of this service will automatically become Walmart Plus members.
The Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer has also invested in services like curbside pickup and next-day and two-day delivery.
Using the Walmart app, Walmart Plus members will be able to scan their purchases as they shop and pay without having to wait in line. Additionally, members can save up to 5 cents a gallon at nearly 2,000 Walmart, Murphy USA (NYSE:MUSA) and Murphy Express fuel stations. 
On Thursday, Walmart said it was joining Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) in a bid for social media company TikTok's U.S. assets as it also seeks to expand its advertising business.

But other investors struck a more cautious note.

Meanwhile, investors await China’s response after the U.S. said on Monday that it was establishing a new bilateral economic dialogue with the country, increasing tensions between the two countries.
Tensions between China and Australia are also mounting after Chinese authorities detained Australian news anchor Cheng Lei in late August and Australian trade minister Simon Birmingham warned that the risks for Australian businesses engaged with China had “changed”.
Down Under, the ASX 200 slumped 2.17%. The Reserve Bank of Australia is due to hand down its policy decision later in the day, few changes expected.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index inched down 0.03%.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 was down 0.25%. Data released earlier in the day showed that the manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) rose to 47.2 in August, up from 46.6 in July and the slowest contraction since February.
The contest to become the country’s next prime minister continues to take shape, with the ruling Liberal Democratic Party’s largest faction supporting current chief cabinet secretary. Yoshihide Suga.
South Korea’s KOSPI rose 0.80%. An Il-whan, second vice minister of the Ministry of Economy and Finance said that the ministry would issue as much as KRW172.9 trillion ($145.68 billion) of sovereign debt in 2021, a record bond issuance for the country.
Capping the losses, however, was progress on a potential vaccine for COVID-19, with the U.K.’s AstraZeneca (NYSE:AZN) planning to enroll 30,000 participants in a late-stage study to evaluate its vaccine candidate AZD1222. Hopes were also raised after U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Monday that Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell could “hopefully” introduce a new bill by the following week, a first step in addressing the stalemate in the U.S. Congress over the latest stimulus measures."

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazilian private equity firm Patria Investimentos has raised a 10 billion-real ($2 billion) fund to invest in infrastructure in Brazil and elsewhere in Latin America, it said on Monday, adding that logistics, energy and telecoms would be key targets.
The infrastructure fund, Patria's fourth, was almost double the size of its previous such fund five years ago and underscored the opportunities investors see, especially in Latin America's largest economy.
Patria is 40% owned by U.S. private equity firm Blackstone Group Inc (N:BX).
The Brazilian government estimates the country needs 600 billion reais in new investments to expand and universalize water and sewage services that remain limited in many areas.
""Despite the coronavirus pandemic, we saw that many investors understood how many opportunities there are in infrastructure in the region,"" Patria's founder and partner Otavio Castello Branco said in an interview.
A steady drop in Brazil's benchmark interest rates, which have now reached a record low of 2%, has fueled a quest for higher-return alternatives to government bonds. Domestic investors accounted for 25% of the fund, setting a record among Patria-raised funds.
Although the fundraising was concluded only this week, Patria has already destined 40% of its proceeds for three assets: Brazilian solar and wind energy firm Essentia, highway operator Eixo-SP and a still unnamed cellular tower company.
Felipe Pinto, another Patria partner, said the fund may invest in these sectors further while also looking for assets in gas power generation, sanitation and telecoms assets beyond towers.
The executive said that although Patria had wanted to invest in the water and sanitation sector in the past, the lack of robust regulations governing the sector gave it pause. That changed in June with congressional approval of a new sanitation law.
Nearly 80% of the fund's proceeds are likely to be invested in Brazil, although Colombia and Chile may provide other targets, Pinto said.
The fund's investment phase is expected to be concluded by 2021, while it may take up to 12 years to sell off the assets.
(In this story, Patria corrects the amount in dollars to $2 billion, not $1.8 billion, to reflect closing date)

546,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 31, 2020 07:30PM ET</span>",Zoom forecasts sales surge as video conferencing becomes a daily routine,"By Neha Malara and Stephen Nellis
(Reuters) -  Zoom Video Communications  (NASDAQ:ZM) Inc raised its annual revenue forecast by more than 30% after comfortably beating quarterly estimates on Monday as it converts more of its huge free user base to paid subscriptions.
Shares of Zoom, which have surged almost four-fold this year, rose 9.3% to $355.30 after the bell. Earlier in the day they hit a record closing high of $325.10 in regular trading.
Video-conferencing platforms, once used mostly as a technological substitute for in-person meetings, became a vital part of day-to-day life this year for people stuck at home under coronavirus restrictions, be it for work, school or socializing. Zoom rivals such as  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT)'s Teams and Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) System Inc's Webex have also seen soaring usage.
When the pandemic hit in early 2020, Zoom was a relative upstart founded by a former Cisco executive that had gone public on a promise to make video conferencing software easier to use. But the ease of use came with privacy and security concerns that drove some customers to competitors earlier this year and prompted Zoom to embark on a 90-day plan to address the issues. Zoom began testing end-to-end encryption of its service in July but has not yet implemented the feature for most users.
The surge in usage also strained Zoom's infrastructure, with some outages last week as schools in many parts of the United States resumed classes virtually.
Since the start of the pandemic, Zoom has worked to convert the mass of free users into paying customers, which is important because the company relies on both its own data centers and cloud providers such as Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and  Oracle Corp  (NYSE:ORCL) to provide its serving, meaning it must bear costs for free users.
The company said revenue rose 355% to $663.5 million, topping analysts' average estimate of $500.5 million. The company's gross profit rose to 71% from 68%, but remains far below the 80% range Zoom operated at before free users flocked to the service. 
On a conference call with investors, Zoom Chief Financial Officer Kelly Steckelberg said the company's gross profits will remain in the same range as the fiscal second quarter for the rest of the fiscal year. She also said the company was experiencing slightly higher rates of customer cancellation than Zoom's historical average, but that the new rates had been factored into the company's forecast.
""The revenue growth is accelerating,"" Chaim Siegel, an analyst with Elazar Advisors, told Reuters. ""Even though they gave very strong guidance for next quarter it's possible they're being conservative if you consider a stay-at-home back-to-school. Zoom is a household word.""
Zoom's number of large customers - those generating more than $100,000 in revenue in the past year - more than doubled to 988 in the fiscal second quarter.
The company, founded and headed by former Cisco manager Eric Yuan, raised its annual revenue target for fiscal year 2021 to a range of $2.37 billion to $2.39 billion, from $1.78 billion to $1.80 billion previously. 
Net income attributable to common stockholders rose to $185.7 million, or 63 cents per share, from $5.5 million, or 2 cents per share, a year earlier. 

Excluding items, the company earned 92 cents per share, beating the average analyst estimate of 45 cents, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

548,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 31, 2020 06:45PM ET</span>","Why Buffett's bet on Japan could turn on higher inflation, weakening dollar","By David Randall and Svea Herbst-Bayliss
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) Inc's $6.2 billion foray into Japan's five largest trading houses may signal billionaire Warren Buffett's expectation that inflation and a falling U.S. dollar may make international equities more attractive when economies worldwide recover from the coronavirus pandemic. 
Berkshire said late Sunday, on Buffett's 90th birthday, it owned just over 5% of each of Itochu Corp, Marubeni Corp, Mitsubishi Corp, Mitsui & Co Ltd and Sumitomo Corp, and said it could increase its stakes to 9.9%.
The trading houses, known as sogo shosha with their diversified business lines including commodity exploration, fit the legendary investor's taste for classic value stocks, which have lost investor favor. 
Berkshire investors said they welcomed Buffett's wager, at a time U.S. stock valuations are at their highest since the late 1990s tech bubble, lifted by giants such as Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), both of which Berkshire invests in. 
""The inflation cocktail is being mixed and Buffett is migrating his investment to where you can create value through inflation,"" said Bill Smead, chief investment officer at Smead Capital Management, which invests nearly 3% of its assets in Berkshire. ""These are companies that will make more money if the price of oil (or) any input goes up."" 
Prices of gold, inflation-linked bonds and some commodities have surged since March on fears that global central banks' more than $9 trillion of stimulus to combat the pandemic will spark higher inflation. 
The Federal Reserve indicated last week it will be slower to move to curtail inflation should it run above its 2% target. 
At the same time, lower valuations and a continued decline in the U.S. dollar, now near a two-year low, could make Japan and other international markets more attractive for U.S. investors, said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at the Leuthold Group. Expectations of dollar weakness bolster the case for U.S. investors to own international equities if profits get a boost from the strength of the currencies they are denominated in.""That adds up to a pretty good situation for investing in these companies,"" Paulson said of Berkshire's choices.The move fits with Buffett's longstanding preference for value stocks. 
“Warren is trying to expand his horizon but stick to his value investing roots at a time the U.S. market is very expensive,"" said Paul Lountzis, president of Lountzis Asset Management, which invests nearly one-fifth of its assets in Berkshire.
Jamie Rosenwald, co-founder and senior portfolio manager of Asia and Japan investments at Dalton Investments, said Buffett got a bargain ""at laughably low valuations on the stock market"" which show the ""tremendous values available in Japan today.""
Buffett, who at Berkshire's annual meeting in May professed optimism in the U.S. ability to persevere through the pandemic, has looked outside the country before, having bought such companies as Israel's IMC International Metalworking and German motorcycle apparel retailer Detlev Louis. “Buffett certainly loves the United States,"" said James Armstrong, president of Henry H. Armstrong Associates, which invests one-fourth its assets in Berkshire. ""Considering that he was able to tap into companies with a global network and their fingers in a lot of pies at an attractive price, that is a winning combination."" 
The bet on the Japanese companies may strengthen Berkshire's toehold in the Chinese market, said Guy Spier, portfolio manager at Aquamarine Capital in Zurich, who said that those businesses ""have spent far more time figuring out how to deal with a rising China than many."" 
Charlie Munger, Berkshire's 96-year-old vice chairman, said in February that Chinese companies are stronger and growing faster than their American counterparts. Berkshire has an investment in BYD Co (OTC:BYDDF), a Chinese electric car maker.The deal will also help Berkshire trim its $145 billion cash pile. 
“Berkshire has the high class problem of needing to put billions of dollars to work,” said Dalton's Rosenwald.

Trial participants will receive either two doses of the experimental vaccine, dubbed AZD1222, four weeks apart, or a placebo, the company said. 
The trial is being conducted under U.S. government's Operation Warp Speed program, which aims to accelerate development, manufacturing and distribution of vaccines and treatments for COVID-19. 
U.S. President Donald Trump has said a vaccine for the novel coronavirus could be available before the Nov. 3 presidential election, much sooner than most experts anticipate.
AstraZeneca, which is developing its vaccine in conjunction with Oxford University researchers, and  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) with partner BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX) have said they could have data by October to support U.S. emergency use authorization or approval of their respective vaccines.
AZD1222 is already undergoing late-stage clinical trials in Britain, Brazil and South Africa, with additional trials planned in Japan and Russia. The trials, together with the U.S. Phase III study, aim to enroll up to 50,000 participants globally.
The U.S. trial will evaluate whether the vaccine can prevent COVID-19 infection or keep the illness from becoming severe, the National Institutes of Health said in a statement https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/phase-3-clinical-testing-us-astrazeneca-covid-19-vaccine-candidate-begins.
It also will assess if the vaccine can reduce incidence of emergency department visits due to COVID-19.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - While the S&P boasted its steepest August percentage gain in more than three decades it ended Monday slightly lower and the Dow also lost ground as investors took a pause although the Nasdaq closed higher thanks to high-flying stocks including Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). 
The Federal Reserve's commitment to tolerate inflation and keep interest rates low, positive developments in vaccines and treatments for COVID-19 and a rally in tech-focused stocks have helped the S&P 500 and Nasdaq hit record highs in August.
But while states such as New Jersey continued to ease restrictions on Monday, investors noted that across the United States, total coronavirus cases topped 6 million on Sunday as many states in the Midwest reported increasing infections, according to a Reuters tally.
""It's a momentum trade. People are flooding to the technology companies they think will do well regardless of the pandemic,"" said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer, Independent Advisor Alliance. 
""The U.S. just passed 6 million cases, a further reminder that the pandemic is here to stay until we do something about it. Clearly it has an impact on all businesses but some are more pandemic resistant,"" he said.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 223.82 points, or 0.78%, to close at 28,430.05, the S&P 500 lost 7.7 points, or 0.22%, to 3,500.31 and the Nasdaq Composite added 79.82 points, or 0.68%, to 11,775.46.
Technology, then healthcare and utilities stocks were the biggest percentage gainers among the 11 major S&P sectors while energy was the biggest percentage decliner. 
With the S&P reaching 3.8% above its pre-crisis record during the session, Mona Mahajan, senior U.S. investment strategist at Allianz (DE:ALVG) Global Investors in New York, said investors were showing some caution by favoring technology as they looked warily at U.S. and overseas COVID-19 numbers.
""After such a strong summer run we're reverting back to the old pandemic playbook so we see tech outperforming,"" she said. ""Really that's a defensive move as people think about stay-at-home more as we're heading toward that fall season."" 
The Nasdaq, meanwhile, ended the day almost 20% above its pre-crisis record closing high. Its top two boosts for Monday were from Apple Inc and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc after their stock splits.
While the splits did not provide a fundamental reason to buy the stocks, Mahajan noted that the lower prices may be making the momentum stocks more attractive to some retail investors.
For the month the S&P showed a gain of 7.01%, its biggest advance for August since 1986 when it rose 7.1% that month. 
The three main indexes showed their fifth straight monthly rise following March lows, even as economic data pointed to an uneven recovery from the steep downturn. 
For the S&P, this was its longest winning steak on a monthly basis since a six-month run from April to September 2018.
And the benchmark's 35.6% gain since April marked the strongest five-month run for the S&P since 1938, according to data from Bespoke Investment Group. 
Apple ended the day 3.4% higher at $129.04 while Tesla closed up 12.6% at $498.32. 
Aimmune Therapeutics (NASDAQ:AIMT) Inc's shares soared 171.6% after Swiss food group Nestle SA (SIX:NESN) offered to pay $2 billion for full ownership of the peanut allergy treatment maker.
Shares of  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT), Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc and  Oracle Corp  (NYSE:ORCL) - all suitors for TikTok's U.S. assets - fell as China's new rules around tech exports meant a deal with TikTok owner ByteDance could need Beijing's approval.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 2.02-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.64-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
The S&P 500 posted 32 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 86 new highs and 24 new lows.

Investing.com -- Monday marked the end of the best August for stocks since the Reagan era -- 1984, specifically -- as the Federal Reserve continued to reassure investors that interest rates would remain low for the foreseeable future.
Fed Vice Chairman Richard Clarida said in a speech earlier in the day that falling unemployment wouldn't push rates higher. He stressed the importance of the central bank's recent policy shift to allow inflation to run above 2%.
The S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average both fell for the day, while NASDAQ Composite rose 0.68%.
There are two more Fed officials lined up to speak this week, including one on Tuesday afternoon. Investors are pushing shares of Chipotle Mexican Grill to an all-time high, and earnings from Zoom Video could set that stock ablaze as well.
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:
1. More reassuring comments from Fed officials
Fed Governor Lael Brainard is scheduled to comment about the bank's monetary policy shift on Tuesday in a 1:00 PM ET (1700 GMT) speech at the Brookings Institution. Onlookers are expecting her to reinforce the message Clarida put forward on Monday.
2. Chipotle at all-time high as shut-ins order burrito delivery
Burrito chain  Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc  (NYSE:CMG) shares are on a five-day rally, hitting an all-time high on Monday. They are up 58% this year, at $1,315.
Hedge fund billionaire Bill Ackman took a gamble on the once-beleaguered company, buying up shares starting in 2016 to a roughly 4% stake now. Back then, Chipotle was suffering from the lingering fallout of bacteria outbreaks in several of its stores and was trying to woo back a skeptical customer base. In his recent letter to Pershing Square shareholders, Ackman said Chipotle has undergone a successful business transformation led by CEO Brian Niccol.
Despite shutdowns because of Covid-19, Chipotle has remained strong. Same store sales plummeted in the spring, but the chain was able to use digital ordering and delivery to keep up business. Digital sales jumped to 70% of all sales in April and fell back somewhat as stores reopened. But the digital channel continues to be a strong driver of growth alongside in-store sales, Ackman noted.
3. Will Zoom earnings zoombomb the stock?
 Zoom Video Communications  Inc (NASDAQ:ZM) has arguably been one of the biggest beneficiaries of the pandemic-induced lockdowns that forced workers and students to rely on video conferencing technology to continue work and school. Already, Zoom is on pace to triple its 2020 revenue from last year. Shares rose 8.6% on Monday.
The young company blew second quarter expectations out of the water, reporting after Monday's closing bell per-share earnings of 92 cents versus the estimated 45 cents. Revenue of $663 million beat the expectation of $500 million. Zoom estimated its own fiscal third-quarter earnings in a range of 73 cents to 74 cents per share on revenue of $685 million to $690 million. That should turbo charge the shares when stocks open for trading in the morning.
Investors have been watching to see how this San Jose, California, company converts subscriber gains into bigger profit. But network security has posed some issues, as uninvited people ""zoombomb"" private meetings. The company has been working to improve privacy and security.

CHICAGO (Reuters) - Delta Air Lines (N:DAL) and American Airlines (O:AAL) said on Monday they are permanently dropping domestic change fees, mirroring an announcement by rival United Airlines (O:UAL) on Sunday in a push to woo back travelers.
U.S. airlines are burning through millions of dollars daily as the coronavirus pandemic hits passenger air travel, which is hovering around 30% of what it was a year ago, forcing more customer-friendly policies to encourage people to start traveling again.
Atlanta-based Delta said the elimination of change fees is effective immediately and includes tickets purchased for travel within the United States, Puerto Rico and U.S. Virgin Islands. American's change also covers flights to Canada, Mexico and the Caribbean.
The new policies do not cover any of the three airlines' basic economy tickets.
Low-cost rival Southwest Airlines (N:LUV) has never charged a change fee for its tickets.
Delta, United and American were already waiving change fees through the end of the year to give travelers more flexibility in an uncertain environment.
The fees represented around 2% to 3% of their total revenues in 2019, though analysts said the overall financial impact going forward will be limited as focus remains on generating bookings.

Delta collected $830 million in ticket cancellation and change fees last year, American $819 million and United $625 million, according to the U.S. Department of Transportation.

""The supervisory board has examined the joint request by Amber Capital and Vivendi to call an extraordinary general meeting. It considers that the legal conditions required to diverge from the corporate schedule known to all shareholders are not presently satisfied"", the group said in a statement.
""It reiterated that it is the guarantor of the group's corporate interest, its independence and its integrity. Accordingly, it has a duty to preserve the group in a particularcontext where one of the shareholders requesting the meeting is a direct competitor of Lagardere Publishing"", the company added, referring to Vivendi.
Amber has been embroiled in a tug-of-war with the firm's managers since 2016, as it pushes for a shake-up in its governance. 
It has been joined in its efforts for a board revamp by French billionaire Vincent Bollore and the Vivendi media group he controls, which has built up a 23.5% stake in Lagardere. Amber, a 20% stakeholder, and Vivendi are asking for four board seats between them.
While rejecting their AGM request, Lagardere also said its supervisory board had ""to engage in constructive and composed dialogue with the shareholders"". 

Bernard Arnault, who runs luxury goods group LVMH (PA:LVMH), is investing in the personal holding company of Arnaud Lagardere, the firm's managing partner - effectively backing the firm and its bosses, which have brushed off Amber in the past.

(Reuters) - Private equity firm TPG is exploring a sale of Astound that could value the owner of a U.S. network of regional cable TV and internet providers at more than $8 billion, including debt, according to people familiar with the matter.
The potential sale would come as cable operators have seen their fortunes buoyed by consumers requiring more internet bandwidth, as they stay home to work and be entertained during the COVID-19 pandemic.
TPG has hired  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS) and JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) to advise on the sale process, the sources said, requesting anonymity as the matter is confidential.
TPG, Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan declined to comment. RCN Telecom Services, a division of Astound, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Astound's network includes RCN, Grande Communications Networks LLC and Wave Broadband. TPG acquired RCN and Grande for $2.25 billion in 2016 and a year later bought Wave Broadband in a $2.37 billion deal.
Astound's businesses serve parts of California, Chicago, Massachusetts, New York City, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Texas and Washington.
Shares of rival broadband provider  Charter Communications  Inc (O:CHTR) are up more than 25% so far in 2020, outpacing the broader market. Charter earlier this month reported second-quarter profit that more than doubled.

AT&T Inc (N:T) has also been looking to capitalize on private equity interest in the sector. It has been making renewed efforts this year to divest its satellite TV business DirecTV and has been having conversations with buyout firms about a potential deal, according to people familiar with the matter. AT&T did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - J.C. Penney Co Inc’s talks with landlords for a rescue from bankruptcy proceedings reached an impasse, pushing the department store to the brink of collapse unless it can reach a deal within days to be taken over by lenders.
Discussions between the Plano, Texas-based retailer and a duo of mall owners Simon Property Group Inc (NYSE:SPG) and Brookfield Property Partners (NASDAQ:BPY) LP stalled over the weekend, Joshua Sussberg, a J.C. Penney lawyer at Kirkland & Ellis LLP, said during a Monday court hearing.
The negotiations have dragged on in part over lease terms, according to people familiar with the matter. Sussberg did not detail that or any other specific sticking points during Monday’s hearing.
Sussberg said lenders were still prepared to rescue the 118-year-old company and more than 70,000 jobs depending on negotiations over the next 10 days. 
A lawyer for the lenders, Andrew Leblanc of Milbank LLP, said there were “lots of hurdles” to reaching such a deal, describing negotiating an agreement on a short timeframe as a “heavy lift.” The two sides set a Sept. 10 deadline.
Simon did not immediately respond to a request for comment while Brookfield declined to comment.
J.C. Penney, which filed for bankruptcy in May after the coronavirus pandemic forced it to temporarily close the nearly 850 stores it operated at the time, is racing to reach a deal that would carve it into three parts.
One would be an operating company housing its retail business, including intellectual property and hundreds of stores. Lenders would forgive portions of J.C. Penney’s $5 billion debt load to take control of two real estate investment trusts. One would hold 160 properties, with the other controlling the company’s distribution centers, Sussberg said.
J.C. Penney had hoped to reach a deal with Simon and Brookfield to take over the company’s retail operations. Sussberg said negotiations with the duo were in the “red zone” earlier this month before hitting roadblocks, including an offer from the company submitted to the landlords over the weekend that received no response. 
The development will force J.C. Penney to close additional stores that at one point might have been saved, Sussberg said.
U.S. Bankruptcy Judge David Jones had previously urged parties to set aside what he labeled egos and negotiating postures to get a deal done.
“I hope everyone realizes how serious I am about this. I know where this is headed,” Jones said during Monday’s hearing. He told a shareholder that declining to allow J.C. Penney to continue talks with lenders would result in all the company’s stores closing and “the death of an entity.”
J.C. Penney’s lenders, which include hedge funds and private-equity firms financing its bankruptcy case, have now agreed to explore forgiving debt to also take control of the company’s retail operations in addition to the two real estate investment trusts they envisioned owning. 
""Our lenders are no longer going to be held hostage,"" Sussberg said. ""Time is not our friend.""
Buyout firm Sycamore Partners and Saks Fifth Avenue owner Hudson’s Bay Co have also held discussions with J.C. Penney to take control of its retail business without reaching a deal, people familiar with the matter have said. 

J.C. Penney continued talks with those suitors over the weekend, Sussberg said, though they did not reach any agreement. Sycamore and Hudson (NYSE:HUD)'s Bay both declined to comment.

Investing.com --  Bigcommerce Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:BIGC) sank 9.5% after analysts initiated coverage without much enthusiasm. 
The stock is trading around $118.47, down 27% since hitting a high last week. The shares were down 15% earlier Monday before regaining some of that ground.
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) rated the stock underweight with a price target of $52, saying that the stock's valuation implies ""highly elevated levels of growth and present meaningful downside risk if results do not meet expectations,"" Morgan Stanley's Stan Zlotsky wrote, according to Seeking Alpha. Morgan Stanley was the lead underwriter on BigCommerce's IPO. 
The company's initial public offering priced at $24 on Aug. 4, and shares reached a peak of $141 on Aug. 27. 
Truist initiated Bigcommerce with a hold rating and a $132 price target, and Raymond James gave it a market perform rating, also on valuation, and did not set a price target, The Fly reported. 
Raymond James's Brian Peterson also cited valuation, noting that shares are trading at 65 times estimated 2021 revenue. He recommends waiting for a more attractive entry point. 
Truist's Terry Tillman had a more positive take on Bigcommerce. The company can sustain improved sales growth given its ""differentiated open SaaS ecommerce platform, investments and market share gains, The Fly said. 
The continued move away from physical stores and toward e-commerce could drive higher gross merchandise value trends, Tillman said.

Investing.com – The Dow fell Monday, paced by a decline in energy, though the index remained on track to notch its best performance for the month of August since 1984.  
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.67%, or 192 points, though it had been down 290 points at the lows of the day. The S&P 500 was flat, while the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.98% on course for another record close.
Energy stocks led the decline as oil price struggled in the wake of data showing U.S. crude production rose 4.2% to 10.436 million barrels per day in June, renewed oversupply concerns.
Fear about supply outstripping demand come as the impact of the coronavirus has hurt travel and tourism activity.
But Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) lifted its forecasts on Brent crude for the second-quarter of next year to $57.50 a barrel from $52 barrel previously amid expectations that vaccines will support global growth.
Losses in the broader market were kept in check by ongoing strength in Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), both of which saw their stocks splits take effect today.
Apple's stock split drew favorable commentary from multiple analysts on Wall Street ahead of the tech giant's iPhone 12 launch.  
""With Apple's 4:1 stock split effective this morning we are adjusting our price target to $150 and bull case to $175 accordingly.

(Reuters) - High-flying shares of Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc surged again on Monday as stock splits took effect and attracted more buying from investors. 
Apple jumped over 4% and Tesla rallied 10%, elevating the electric car maker's market capitalization to over $440 billion, making it more valuable than companies including Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and Johnson & Johnson . 
Apple split its stock 4-for-1, while Tesla split its stock 5-for-1, with both companies saying they aimed to make their shares more affordable to individual investors. 
Robinhood and other brokerages increasingly let customers buy fractions of individual shares, making the benefit of stock splits less obvious than in the past. Splits have become less common. Just three S&P 500 members announced splits in 2020, down from 12 in 2011, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. 
The success of the splits for Apple and Tesla could lead CEOs of other companies with high-priced stocks to consider their own splits.
For a graphic on Stock splits an endangered species on Wall Street:

Both Silicon Valley companies have massive followings among individual investors. In recent sessions, Apple and Tesla were the two most-traded stocks at Fidelity's brokerage, with customers overwhelmingly buying.
Tesla's stock has surged over 70% since its split was announced on Aug. 11. Apple has jumped over 30% since it announced its split on July 30, along with a blowout quarterly report.
Trading at over $2,000 on Friday on a split-adjusted basis, Tesla's stock had among the highest price tags on Wall Street. Other companies with quadruple-digit stock prices included Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), at over $3,400, Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), at over $1,600, and Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG), trading at over $1,300.
Apple's previous stock split was 7-for-1 in 2014, and this month's split was its fifth since going public in 1980. 
Apple and Tesla's share splits applied to shareholders of record on Aug. 24.
Apple's market capitalization has surged above $2 trillion, and it overtook  Saudi Aramco  (SE:2222) as the world's most valuable publicly listed company.

Tesla's stock has jumped almost 500% this year, while shares of General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) and Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co fell due to fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic.

563,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 31, 2020 01:45PM ET</span>","Not all gloom for aviation training as MAX, cargo fleets beckon","By Sanjana Shivdas and Allison Lampert
(Reuters) - Aviation training specialists, which saw simulator sales plummet when the coronavirus pandemic brought air travel to a near halt, are getting some relief from an uptick in demand from cargo carriers and airlines gearing up for the Boeing (N:BA) 737 MAX's return to service.
Simulator makers Textron (N:TXT) and  CAE  (TO:CAE) had bet on a sales bonanza with Boeing recommending fresh pilot training on a MAX simulator for the aircraft grounded since March 2019 following two deadly crashes, when it finally flew again.
The pandemic dashed those hopes, crippling air traffic and casting doubt over the jet's future. 
Now they look to business aviation, a lifting of travel restrictions, revived hopes for the MAX's certification later this year or early next, and heavier cargo traffic to boost training and help through the simulator sales drought.
TRU Flight Training Iceland, a joint venture between Icelandair and Textron's TRU Simulation + Training, for example, is seeing continued demand from cargo pilots training on its Boeing 757 simulator, its managing director Gudmundur Orn Gunnarson said.
Cargo carriers and Icelandair are now the center's top sources of training activity, though that is roughly at half of where it was a year ago, Gunnarson said.
Canada's CAE, the world's largest civil aviation training company, said it was in advanced discussions with airlines about doing more training after it reported a sharp drop in simulator deliveries.
Both CAE and its U.S. rival Textron built 737 MAX simulators last year without formal orders, betting on pent up demand, but the pandemic dashed those expectations.
A CAE spokeswoman said the majority have since been converted to orders and been delivered.  
CAE delivered 56 full-flight simulators in fiscal year 2020 ended on March 31, but only two in April-June. Textron in June suspended the production of simulators at its Montreal plant, cutting up to 1,950 jobs across several business units. 
Textron and CAE see a quicker recovery in business aviation, where flights have dropped 4% in the U.S. year-to-date compared with 2019, even as commercial traffic plunged 45%, according to Flightaware. 
Textron also sees demand in the simulator training market from schools and the military, said Vance Ontjes, TRU's director of training and customer services.
Gunnarson said the Icelandair joint venture has orders to lease the 737 MAX simulator for pilot training, though that will happen only when the plane is close to being certified. 
Jonathan Norman, aerospace consultant at Frost & Sullivan, expects MAX's certification in the U.S. to fuel extra demand for training for a year. 
""That's the amount of time it is going to take airlines to re-certify all their pilots,"" he said, adding Southwest Airlines (N:LUV) - the largest operator of the MAX worldwide - may need to retrain all of its pilots.
Job cuts across the industry and many experienced pilots retiring, with new recruits furloughed or laid off, will also require retraining many who remain.
""It creates a cascade effect,"" said aviation consultant Kit Darby. 
U.S. airlines, which received $25 billion in March to cover payroll and protect jobs until September, are asking for a further installment, though talks on another government COVID-19 stimulus remain stalled.
American Airlines (O:AAL), United Airlines (O:UAL) and Delta Air Lines (N:DAL) are bracing for pilot cuts.
The government program's expiry could even overwhelm training providers, says Dennis Tajer, a spokesman for the Allied Pilots Association that represents AA pilots.
""Potential furloughs should they hit are going to drown the training facilities with the amount of training that needs to be done,"" he said.
Longer-term, training and simulator providers will have to contend with smaller fleets and fewer pilots given industry predictions of air travel returning to pre-pandemic levels in 2024.

Analysts also doubt an upswing in cargo business can last given the underlying weakness of the global economy.

Hanover Pennsylvania-based Utz on Friday completed its reverse merger with Collier Creek Holdings, a publicly listed shell company which will be renamed as Utz.
The decision to go public was made in part to prepare for the gradual transition to the next generation of Utz family ownership, according to Chief Executive Dylan Lissette. 
""We have a fourth-to-fifth generational movement just as the family was getting older, and rotating from the third generation into the fourth generation then the fourth into the fifth over time,"" Lissette, a fourth-generation family member through marriage, said in a telephone interview. 
Collier Creek is a so-called special purpose acquisition company (SPAC), a shell company which raises funds in an initial public offering to make an acquisition and take a firm public. 
Utz's stock opened at $18.95, up from Collier Creek's close of $16.34 on Friday. The stock had pared gains by early afternoon to $16.89. Collier Creek's stock had already jumped on the back of the deal announcement in June.
Collier Creek had completed its IPO at $10 per share in 2018. The SPAC is backed by veteran dealmaker Chinh Chu and ex-Pinnacle Foods Chairman Roger Deromedi, who will become Utz's chairman. 
Utz reported an 11% jump in pro forma net sales to $242 million for the quarter ended June 28.
""When the lockdowns of the pandemic started in that latter half of March, early parts of April, what it really ended up doing is just increasing demand for snack foods,"" Lissette said.

569,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 31, 2020 12:09PM ET</span>",Relentless Risk Rally Spurs Record Exodus from Cash-Like ETFs,"(Bloomberg) -- Investors are abandoning cash holdings at a record clip as momentum continues to build behind 2020’s risk rally.
Roughly $5.4 billion has exited from the $20 billion iShares Short Treasury Bond exchange-traded fund -- the biggest ultra-short duration ETF -- over 14 consecutive weeks of outflows. That was the longest streak on record for the product, whose ticker is SHV. Meanwhile, investors have pulled $2.4 billion from the $14 billion SPDR Bloomberg  Barclays  (LON:BARC) 1-3 Month T-Bill ETF (BIL) over 10 weeks, according to Bloomberg Intelligence data.
Investors accumulated record amounts of cash earlier this year amid concern over the impacts of the coronavirus pandemic on the global economy, with assets in money-market mutual funds soaring to a record $4.8 trillion in late May. However, that cash is coming off the sidelines as stocks surge and corporate bonds look increasingly appealing. Additionally, the Federal Reserve’s commitment to keep interest rates at near-zero levels for the foreseeable future is further curbing appetite for short-duration Treasury ETFs.
“It’s recognition that ‘ZIRP’ will be around for a long time, combined with a rising risk appetite,” said Kathy Jones,  Charles Schwab  (NYSE:SCHW) Corp.’s chief fixed-income strategist, referring to the concept of a zero interest-rate policy. “Short-term Treasury ETFs are looking less attractive than alternatives. Equities are benefiting. We also see interest in foreign equities and high-yield and emerging-market bonds.”
The S&P 500 has surged more than 55% from its March’s bottom, after plummeting into the swiftest bear-market on record. The Fed’s credit market backstop has boosted both investment-grade and junk bonds, with the largest high-yield debt ETF climbing nearly 24% since late March. The emerging-market outlook is also considerably brighter amid the dollar’s continued weakness and the Fed’s new average-inflation targeting regime.
The exodus from ultra-short duration ETFs is also likely due to investors trying to eliminate the “cash drag” in their portfolios by reinvesting in higher-yielding assets, according to Dan Suzuki at Richard Bernstein Advisors.
“Because they’re not generating any yield, they are acting as huge dead weight in many people’s portfolios,” said Suzuki, the firm’s deputy chief investment officer. “Investors are probably chasing higher returns, which means moving up the risk spectrum.”

NEW DELHI (Reuters) -  Reliance Industries ' (NS:RELI) $3.38 billion deal to acquire Future Group's retail business pitches the conglomerate as an even more formidable force in India, making its retail arm more attractive to the potential investors it seeks to woo.
The oil-to-telecoms group controlled by India's richest man, Mukesh Ambani, announced late on Saturday that it will acquire Future Group's retail and wholesale business as well as its logistics and warehousing operations.
The acquisition of Future Group's 2,000 retail stores and Big Bazaar grocery chain will help Reliance, which sells everything from groceries to electronics through 11,000-plus stores, to broaden its extensive reach across the country.
But with Ambani set to sell stakes in Reliance Retail, the Future-Reliance deal makes it an even more attractive proposition for investors in a market that Boston Consulting Group expects to grow to $1.3 trillion by 2025.
""With this deal, Reliance's dominance in the Indian market increases further and the valuation that Reliance Retail will now command will be even more,"" said Arvind Singhal, chairman of retail consultancy Technopak Advisors.
Reliance, which has raised a little more than $20 billion from global investors including  Facebook Inc  (O:FB) by selling stakes in its Jio Platforms digital business, has said it aims to attract investors in Reliance Retail over the next few quarters.
""We've received strong interest from strategic and financial investors in Reliance Retail,"" Ambani told shareholders at the company's annual general meeting in July.
The acquisition will also help Reliance to extend its lead over its competitors, Singhal added.
FINANCIAL MUSCLE
Mumbai-based Reliance is well known for its ability to win over customers with financial muscle and its breadth of offerings.
Shares in its rivals reflected as much on Monday. 
Avenue Supermarts (NS:AVEU), which runs popular grocery chain DMart, fell as much as 5.4% while Aditya Birla Fashion and Retail (NS:ADIA) closed 2.6% down and V-Mart Retail (NS:VMAR) lost 4.4%.
Shares in Reliance rose in early trade but closed 1.7% down, in line with the broader market (NSEI) as a fresh border flare-up between India and China outweighed initial optimism from a further opening of the economy after coronavirus lockdowns. (BO)
JioMart, the new Reliance e-commerce venture that offers free express delivery from neighbourhood stores, will also gain a leg-up from the Future Group deal thanks to a wider wholesale supplier base.
JioMart delivers groceries, apparel and electronics in more than 200 cities, challenging established online retailers such as Amazon's (O:AMZN) India unit and Walmart's (N:WMT) Flipkart.
""Reliance has essentially removed one competitor from the market and added Future's loyal customer base to its own portfolio,"" said Harminder Sahni, founder of retail consultancy Wazir Advisors. 

""It's a very serious challenge not just for Flipkart or Amazon, but for the likes of DMart, too.""

China's new rules around tech exports mean ByteDance's sale of TikTok U.S. operations could need approval from Beijing, a Chinese trade expert told state media on Sunday, a requirement that would complicate the forced and politically charged divestment.
Shares of Walmart, Microsoft and Oracle fell between 1% and 2.5% in morning trading.
All three pared some premarket losses after CNBC reported earlier in the day that TikTok has chosen a bidder and a deal could be announced as early as Tuesday. (https://cnb.cx/3gJkLeN)
TikTok leadership said in a memo to employees earlier last week that the company was ""moving quickly to find resolutions to the issues that we face globally, particularly in the U.S. and India"". 
China, however, late on Friday revised a list of technologies banned or restricted for export for the first time in 12 years. Cui Fan, a professor of international trade at the University of International Business and Economics in Beijing, said the changes would apply to TikTok.
""That probably throws a wrinkle in it, but I don't think that causes the deal not to get done,"" Edward Jones analyst Brian Yarbrough said.

""It has been pretty clear that if this deal doesn't get done, then they're going to ban it in the United States and that's terrible for all parties.""

Nestle Health Science already has a 25.6% equity stake in the company, with its first investment made in 2016.   
""Aimmune has $261 million in cash and $134 million in debt. With our prior investment of $473 million in Aimmune, we'll be making a cash payment of just under $2 billion,"" NHS head Greg Behar told Reuters in an interview.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Aimmune's Palforzia for peanut allergies in January. It is an oral immunotherapy indicated for the mitigation of allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, that may occur with accidental exposure to peanuts. More than 1.6 million kids and teenagers in the U.S. have peanut allergies, the company said.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - A small independent Russian teachers' union is urging members not to be coerced into accepting shots of the ""Sputnik V"" coronavirus vaccine which is to be mandatory for military personnel.
Moscow clinics last week began receiving supplies of the vaccine, which has been approved for use inside Russia even though the final Phase III tests, involving 40,000 people, began only last Wednesday.
From September, doctors and teachers will be among the first to be offered the jab on a voluntary basis, officials have said, an arrangement President Vladimir Putin has said he supports. 
Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu has said shots of the vaccine will be made mandatory for military personnel.
With Russian schools re-opening on Sept. 1 for the first time since March, the teachers' union Uchitel has launched an online petition against making the vaccine mandatory for teachers before all clinical trials are complete.
""It's likely that school principals will be under pressure for everyone to be vaccinated,"" the petition says. 
Uchitel represents only about 700 of Russia's 1.2 million school teachers, a senior union official said, but it says nearly 1,400 people have signed its petition. 
The Health Ministry said vaccination would be voluntary and redirected other questions to the Education Ministry, which did not reply to a request for a comment. 
The Moscow mayor's office said any trials would be on a voluntary basis and that ""there is no pressure on schools and therefore, no punishment measures towards teachers."" Uchitel is the only teachers' union known to have issued such a petition.
But Uchitel's co-chair, Marina Baluyeva, an English-language teacher from St Petersburg, drew parallels with occasional weekends when staff are asked to help do clean-up work, saying this work was voluntary in theory but that teachers who decline to do the work can get into trouble.
WARNINGS BY WESTERN EXPERTS 
Russia is the first country to license a COVID-19 vaccine, calling it ""Sputnik V"" in homage to the world's first satellite, launched by the Soviet Union. Western experts have warned against its use until all internationally approved testing and regulatory steps have been taken. Moscow has dismissed such criticism as an information war.
One Moscow school has already offered voluntary shots to its nearly 80 teachers, several staff at the school said. One of the teachers, Larisa Ivanovna, said 20 had signed up for the jab but that her decision was driven by fear of losing their job.

""I am afraid of taking the risk of an untested vaccine,"" said Dmitry Kazakov, a history teacher who signed the Uchitel petition and is wary even though his bosses have not asked him to have the jab. ""Sometimes you get an offer you cannot reject.""

European shares were on track to post their biggest gain for the month of August since the financial crisis in 2009, helped by positive news on the vaccine front and as governments in the region ruled out new lockdowns.
The Stoxx Europe 600 Index was little changed at 2:23 p.m. CET, after rising as much as 0.7% earlier in the session. While the index is up 3.5% on the month, it’s still stuck in its summer trading range, falling behind a sharp rally on Wall Street where a number of stock benchmarks have hit record highs. Volumes were thin on Monday in Europe, as the U.K. market was closed for a public holiday.
Sentiment was boosted on Monday by data showing Chinese economic activity rebounding further this month, with a gauge of the services industry at the strongest level since early 2018. The week is set to offer clues about Europe’s economic recovery also, with final euro-area PMI numbers and Italy’s GDP for the second quarter due. Europe’s utility sector featured among the top gainers on Monday, with shares in French water management company Suez SA (OTC:SZSAY) jumping 19% after Veolia Environnement (OTC:VEOEY) SA offered 2.9 billion euros ($3.5 billion) for a 29.9% stake in the company.

578,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 31, 2020 09:45AM ET</span>",Buffett’s 1977 Letter Hints at Why He Likes Japan Trading Houses,"(Bloomberg) -- What does Warren Buffett see in Japan’s biggest trading companies?
The question is making the rounds from Tokyo to Wall Street as investors parse the legendary stock picker’s decision to buy stakes in five Japanese conglomerates whose interests span everything from home-shopping networks to salmon farming.
While Buffett has offered few details on what attracted him to names like Itochu Corp. and Mitsui & Co., investors could do worse than look back to his 1977 letter to stockholders, his earliest such note available on Berkshire Hathaway’s website. There, he lays out the four business qualities that Berkshire values:
We want the business to be (1) one that we can understand
To some investors, Japan’s trading houses are anything but easy to understand.
Mitsubishi Corp., the largest of the five companies that Buffett invested in, is a major producer of coking coal and controls one of Japan’s biggest convenience store chains. Mitsui & Co., Itochu Corp., Mitsui & Co. and Sumitomo Corp. are just as diverse, operating hospitals and selling tires. The lack of focus has at times garnered criticism.
However, the firms derive the bulk of their revenue from industries that Berkshire knows well -- energy and commodities. For example, Marubeni gets more than 90% of its revenue from agriculture, metals, energy and chemicals. Mitsubishi gets more than 42% from commodities, while the other firms count on the sector for at least 30%.
Buffett has been ramping up his energy and commodities investments elsewhere too. In July, Berkshire purchased most of Dominion Energy’s natural-gas pipeline and storage assets. It also recently bought a headline-grabbing stake in Barrick Gold (NYSE:GOLD) Corp.
“I’ve always said about the energy business: It’s not a way to get real rich, but it’s a way to stay real rich,” Buffett said at Berkshire Hathaway’s annual general meeting in May.
(2) with favorable long-term prospects
Trading houses are among the oldest companies in the world, and -- due in part to their wide diversification -- are unlikely to go bust anytime soon. Mitsui & Co. and Sumitomo have roots dating back to the 17th century, while Mitsubishi and Itochu are well over 100 years old.
The investment suggests Berkshire expects commodity prices and global trade flows to recover from the damage caused by the pandemic and the U.S.-China trade war, according to Yunosuke Ikeda, chief equity strategist at Nomura Securities.
And in the case that resources are unable to recover, trading firms are resilient because they’re diversified in new growth sectors, including IT, healthcare and even space. Despite a dip in revenue amid Covid-19, the top three trading houses maintained or increased their annual dividends.
The trading houses “will be around for a very long time,” said Thanh Ha Pham, an analyst at Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) Japan Ltd. “Given that they pay out a very large chunk at dividends, it is a good yield.”
(3) operated by honest and competent people
The companies may have appealed to Buffett in part because Japan has a reputation for trusted accounting, according to Pham, who called the country “a natural fit.”
To be sure, trading houses have suffered a handful of scandals over the last few decades. The latest was at Mitsubishi, which said last year that a Singapore-based employee had racked up over $300 million losses on unauthorized crude oil derivatives at a now-shuttered unit.
But generally the companies are known for being elite employment destinations in Japan, and they have no difficulty attracting top talent from the best universities. The five largest trading houses are among the top 35 most sought after companies for 2021 graduates, according to a survey conducted by Career+.
(4) available at a very attractive price
As always, valuations are likely to play a big factor for Buffett. A slump in the trading houses’ shares earlier this year left most of them trading below book value, with Sumitomo the cheapest at 0.69. Only Itochu is trading above book at 1.2 times. That compares with about 1.8 for the Nikkei 225 Stock Average.
“Mr. Buffett is looking at the intrinsic value,” Pham said. “These trading companies have evolved from trading to holdings companies. So they generate a large majority of earnings from equity holdings.”

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets started the week in mostly negative territory, against a backdrop of reported technical outages at a number of brokerages including Robinhood and TD Ameritrade (NASDAQ:AMTD),
While prices had still been supported in premarket by strong data in China and expectations of easier monetary policy after Federal Reserve Charman Jerome Powell's keynote speech last week, there was little else to get excited about, and selling pressure accelerated slightly over the first half hour of trading.
By 10:10 AM ET (1410 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 179 points, or 0.6%, at 28,473 points. The S&P 500, which had been on course to open at a new record high, instead was down 0.2%, while the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.3%.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock was up 1.6% while Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock, after a quiet opening, rose 4.1% as the two stocks traded for the first time after splitting at the weekend.
The cut in Apple's nominal share price weighed on the Dow Jones, a price-weighted index, as it reduced the influence of movements in Apple - one of the strongest index components this year - to the benefit of less well supported names.
Elsewhere, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) stock fell 0.7% and Walmart (NYSE:WMT) stock fell 2.5% after their bid to buy the U.S. operations of video-streaming service TikTok was thwarted - at least temporarily - by new Chinese regulations restricting the export of artificial intelligence software.  Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) shares, which had also gained on speculation that it may buy the TikTok assets, fell 0.9%.
AT&T (NYSE:T) stock fell 0.2% despite hopes that it will revive plans to sell DirecTV, one of its more expensive and less successful acquisitions in a spree that left it with over $150 billion in net debt.. In growth stocks, Beyond Meat  (NASDAQ:BYND) stock rose 4.4% to a three-week high after an upgrade from  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) analysts.
Earlier, Federal Reserve vice-chairman Richard Clarida had failed to add much to the state of market knowledge in a speech fleshing out the Fed's adoption of an average inflation target over the medium term, a shift that analysts say will result in a structurally looser monetary policy. Fed Chairman Powell's speech had kept all risk assets, including equities, well supported at the end of last week, despite prompting an upward tick in long-term bond yields, which translate into a higher cost of capital for most companies.
The Fed's strategy shift has kept the dollar under pressure since then. The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of developed-market currencies, was down 0.1% at 92.25, while gold futures were up 0.2% at $1,979.40 a troy ounce.

MEXICO CITY/LONDON (Reuters) - At a time when oil production is at historic lows, lenders who want Mexican oil giant Pemex to adapt to climate change are struggling to be heard.
Big oil companies such as  BP  (L:BP), Royal Dutch Shell (L:RDSa) and Repsol (MC:REP) have begun to build strategies to cut the carbon they emit. But state-owned Petroleos Mexicanos [PEMX.UL], one of the biggest borrowers in emerging markets, is determined to push in the opposite direction, three people in the company and in the government told Reuters.
President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, a leftist oil nationalist, has staked his reputation on reviving Pemex, which has been a powerful symbol of Mexican self-reliance since its creation in 1938 but is now heavily indebted. Earlier this year, Pemex became history's largest ""fallen angel"" - a borrower that descends from investment grade to junk.
Lopez Obrador has said rehabilitating the country's six outdated oil refineries and building a seventh one in his home state, Tabasco, is key. He considers the new refinery a milestone towards energy independence, one top source in the finance ministry said, adding that this concern has become more pressing in light of U.S. President Donald Trump's power to stifle Mexico's economy. Lopez Obrador is determined to keep Pemex focused on exploration for oil, the sources said.
Pemex, which employs nearly 150,600 workers and is the source of almost a fifth of Mexico's budget revenues, is set to be a critical test case for both institutional investors and climate change campaigners looking to push through change.
If its management does not heed calls to curb carbon emissions, ""it will become tougher for them to issue debt,"" said Marie-Sybille Connan, an analyst at asset manager Allianz (DE:ALVG) Global Investors. 
Investors have rarely spoken about their engagement with Pemex management, but Allianz is one of four major lenders who are now going public. Nearly 90% of the oil company's $107.2 billion total financial debt is held by bond investors, Refinitiv Eikon data, quarterly reports and filings related to recent refinancing transactions show. On top of this, it has $64.9 billion in pension liabilities. 
""It will become increasingly challenging for international institutional investors to invest in their bond issuances if they don't address their sustainability concerns - whether climate, oil spills due to oil theft and health and safety,"" Connan said.
The biggest challenge for both Mexico and Pemex is the fact that there are other things that take priority, said Aaron Gifford, emerging market debt analyst at T.Rowe Price, one of the largest holders of Pemex bonds. After the taxes the company pays to the government, there's no money left to invest in new ways to produce oil. 
""We've been very keen on speaking to Pemex's board and really trying to get them to commit to making changes for good,"" said Gifford. But management has canceled a lot of investor meetings and calls.
""Those meetings that I've been in, they've been very tense and sometimes even a little bit heated,"" he said. ""We have so many questions for them.""
Pemex, the Mexican finance ministry and the president's office did not respond to requests for comment. Lopez Obrador, who has pointed to Mexico's state-run hydroelectric plants to show he backs renewable energy, has blamed his predecessors for Pemex's problems. Financial debt surged by 75% under the last government, a Reuters analysis of accounts from the past decade shows. 
Graphic: refinery destroys biodiversity site https://tmsnrt.rs/2YJVcnv
CREDIT CRUNCH
On paper, Pemex is barely solvent. Its liabilities exceed its assets by more than $110 billion, its accounts show. The reason international investors keep lending is because the market considers the Mexican government has given an implicit guarantee for Pemex. 
This support was reiterated in April, after Pemex's bonds were downgraded. ""Now, more than ever before, Petroleos Mexicanos has the absolute backing of the federal government,"" company executives said in a letter on government-headed notepaper to investors, seen by Reuters.
Market pressure is already building. The company's yield spreads have widened, showing it is already getting harder to borrow as even yield-hungry investors are rethinking their investments. Yields on Pemex bonds are between about 7% and just under 9% for the most frequently traded ones as of Aug. 28, according to MarketAxess data.
Investors such as Allianz said that even if Pemex has pressing problems now, it shouldn't ignore long-term objectives. None expect radical change, but the four who spoke to Reuters said they feel the company is not taking their concerns seriously. 
If international investors become reluctant to lend, Mexico's own access to credit could also be at stake. Ratings agencies have repeatedly cited the company's unsustainable debt level as a risk factor for the sovereign rating. Mexico's sovereign bonds are skirting the edge of a downgrade.
Climate Action 100+, a group of 450 asset managers with collective assets of some $40 trillion, told Reuters earlier this month it would add Pemex to the list of 160 companies it seeks to speak to directly to prompt them to develop strategies for a lower carbon future.
""When we look at what peers are doing, Pemex should do more, show more ambition in terms of commitment to reduce carbon emissions,"" said Jaime Gornsztejn, who leads the engagement with Latin American companies for Federated Hermes (NYSE:FHI), a fund manager which is spearheading that effort. 
He and others said companies such as Colombia's Ecopetrol (CN:ECO) and Brazil's Petroleo Brasileiro, or Petrobras (SA:PETR4), have gone further than Pemex to address climate concerns.
""We haven't had much traction so far,"" he said.
Pemex's credit options are constrained by Mexico's proximity to the United States. Even if other countries were hypothetically open to lending to the company, Jorge Sanchez, director at Mexican financial think tank Fundef, said it was unlikely Mexico would turn to them. 
""It's not about Pemex, it's about geopolitics,"" Sanchez said. ""The United States won't be happy if the main investors in Pemex, Mexico's largest company, were Chinese or Russian.""
PRESSURE
Pemex was the ninth biggest energy producer of carbon and methane emissions globally between 1965 and 2018, according to data from the Climate Accountability Institute, an NGO, with emissions of some 23 billion tonnes of CO2 equivalent. 
That is less than the largest state-owned emitters,  Saudi Aramco  (SE:2222) and the National Iranian Oil Company, but more than any other Latin American oil company, the data showed.
Even so, sources with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters the company has no plans to change its strategy.
Lopez Obrador's energy agenda rolls back some of the moves made by his predecessor to open the energy market to the private sector. Next year's budget will likely be dedicated to boosting oil extracted from shallow waters, one senior Pemex executive with direct knowledge of the draft proposal said, adding there was no allocation for greener policies. 
While the President says he is committed to clean energy, he has justified government efforts to impede the roll-out of new privately built solar and wind capacity on the grounds that those plants were tainted by corruption in past administrations. ""(Renewable energy) was used as a pretext for doing lucrative business ... to get government subsidies, to push up the price of electricity and affect us all,"" he said in July.    He has also complained that wind farms are an eyesore.
""There's no way the government will consider another scenario for its energy policy,"" a person at the oil company's commercial arm PMI said, on condition of anonymity. ""What they're looking for is becoming a big player in exploration, production and refining.""
The kind of oil Pemex mostly produces, known as ""heavy sour crude,"" has fallen out of favor over environmental concerns because refining it tends to produce highly polluting sulfur-rich fuel oil. 
Last December, Mexico's energy regulatory commission agreed that the government could postpone a planned rule that would have required Pemex to produce and sell only ultra-low sulfur diesel across the country. 

Pemex had asked the courts to give it more time to comply with the rule, saying Mexico lacked the infrastructure to comply.

Investing.com - U.S. stock futures pointed to a modestly higher open on Wall Street on Monday, with markets on track to rack up their best August in more than 30 years.
At 7:15 AM ET (1215 GMT), the Dow futures contract rose 47 points, or 0.1%. S&P 500 futures traded eight points, or 0.2%, higher, while Nasdaq 100 futures were up 0.4%.
The gains came after the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq closed at all-time highs on Friday, with the S&P 500 looking set to record its strongest August performance in 34 years.
Last week marked the fifth consecutive weekly gain for the S&P and the Nasdaq, while the Dow is now in positive territory year-to-date having erased its losses for 2020 on Friday.
The rally in stocks markets has been powered by massive monetary and fiscal stimulus in recent months, offsetting concerns over the outlook for a global economy which has been ravaged by the fallout from the coronavirus pandemic.
Optimism around developing vaccines and treatments for COVID-19 and robust demand for tech stocks have also boosted markets.
Last week Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell announced a shift to ‘average inflation targeting’ that could allow inflation to run above its 2% target. The shift has been broadly interpreted as locking in near-zero interest rates for as much as five years.
Several Fed officials are set to speak this week, kicking off with Vice Chair Richard Clarida at 9 AM ET (1300 GMT). Atlanta Fed president Raphael Bostic is also due to speak at 10:30 AM ET.  The Dallas Fed’s monthly business survey is due out at the same time.
Shares in Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) gained ground in premarket trade ahead of their first official trading following stock splits aimed at making it less expensive for retail investors to own the shares.
Oil prices were higher on Monday with Brent hitting its highest levels in five months boosted by a reduction in Abu Dhabi crude supplies and encouraging Chinese economic data overnight.
U.S. crude futures traded 1.3% higher at $43.52 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract rose 1.4% to $46.45.
Elsewhere, gold futures were a touch lower at $1,972.3/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% higher at 1.1926."

ZURICH (Reuters) - Nestle plans to pay $2 billion to gain full ownership of peanut allergy treatment maker Aimmune Therapeutics (NASDAQ:AIMT), as the Swiss company expands its fast-growing health science business.
Known for its KitKat chocolate bars and Nescafe instant coffee, Nestle set up Nestle Health Science (NHS) in 2011 to open up a new area of business between food and pharma. 
Nestle said in a statement that its offer for Aimmune values the California-based biopharmaceutical firm, which it has been working with since 2016 and in which it already has a stake of around 25.6%, at $2.6 billion.
""Aimmune has $261 million in cash and $134 million in debt. With our prior investment of $473 million in Aimmune, we'll be making a cash payment of just under $2 billion,"" NHS head Greg Behar told Reuters in an interview.
Nestle estimates that up to 240 million people worldwide suffer from food allergies, with peanut allergy being the most common, and with Aimmune, NHS will have prevention, diagnostic and medical treatment options available, Behar said.
Aimmune's Palforzia peanut allergy treatment, which recently gained U.S. approval for children, has sales potential of $1 billion, Behar said. The deal is expected to add to organic growth in 2021 and to cash earnings by 2022/23. 
The NHS business was on track to more than double sales by 2022, from 2 billion Swiss francs ($2.21 billion) in 2014, and was expected to close 2020 at 3.3 billion francs, he added.
""(Palforzia) has 12 years of exclusivity, global rollout will follow and they have the technology platform for other food allergies in development,"" Behar said.
Nestle, whose shares were up 0.6% at 0739 GMT, is offering a 174% premium to Aimmune's closing share price of $12.60 on Aug. 28. Aimmune shares hit a record high in January when Palforzia was approved, then dropped during the coronavirus crisis.
Vontobel analyst Jean-Philippe Bertschy said the deal was ""another milestone"" for NHS after it bought Atrium in 2017.
Nestle has a market capitalisation of just under 317 billion Swiss francs ($350 billion), Refinitiv data showed.

585,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 31, 2020 07:01AM ET</span>",Buffett looks to Japan with $6 billion bet on five biggest trading firms,"(Reuters) -  Berkshire Hathaway Inc  (N:BRKa) has bought a 5% stake in each of Japan's five biggest trading houses, together worth over $6 billion, marking a departure for Chairman Warren Buffett as he looks beyond the United States to diversify his conglomerate.
The long-term investment in Itochu Corp (T:8001), Marubeni Corp (T:8002), Mitsubishi Corp (T:8058), Mitsui & Co Ltd (T:8031) and Sumitomo Corp (T:8053) could see the stakes rise to 9.9%, Berkshire said on Sunday, Buffett's 90th birthday.
""The five major trading companies have many joint ventures throughout the world and are likely to have more,"" Buffett said in a statement. ""I hope that in the future there may be opportunities of mutual benefit.""
The investment will help reduce Berkshire's dependence on the U.S. economy, which in the last quarter contracted the most in at least 73 years as the COVID-19 pandemic took hold. Many of its businesses have struggled, including aircraft parts maker Precision Castparts from which it bore a $9.8 billion writedown.
Buffett's choice in Japan, however, surprised market players as trading houses have long been far from investor favorites. As well as significant exposure to the energy sector and resource price volatility, tangled business models involving commodities as varied as noodles and rockets have long been a turn-off.
""Their cheap valuation may have been an attraction,"" said Norihiro Fujito, chief investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ (NYSE:MUFG)  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Securities in Tokyo. ""But it is un-Buffett-like to buy into all five companies rather than selecting a few."" 
BELOW BOOK
Berkshire bought the little-over 5% stakes in about a year through insurance business National Indemnity Co. Together, five 5% stakes were worth 700 billion yen ($6.63 billion), Reuters calculations showed based on Refinitiv data.
Firms' shares often rise when Buffett discloses investment, reflecting what investors view as his imprimatur. On Monday, Marubeni and Sumitomo ended up over 9%, followed by Mitsubishi and Mitsui at over 7%. Itochu rose 4.2% to a record high.
Berkshire shares were flat in premarket trade. 
Even so, Marubeni, Mitsubishi and Sumitomo are still 10% down on the year, versus a 6% fall in the Topix (TOPX) index. Itochu, which has shifted towards consumer-related businesses, is the only one whose share price is higher than last year.
Indeed, Itochu is the only one whose stock trades above its book value. That means, for the other four, their market capitalization is less than the value of their assets, making them attractive to a value investor like Buffett.
Several have large amounts of cash on hand, raising their appeal. Mitsubishi, for instance, has seen steady growth in free cash flow per share for four years, Refinitiv data showed.
Trading houses are also deeply involved in the real economy in areas such as steel, shipping, commodities, putting them on the radar of an investor such as Buffett who famously avoids investing in businesses he claims not to understand.
Asked about the investment, Mitsui told Reuters it aims to improve returns for all shareholders. Marubeni and Mitsubishi said they will continue efforts to improve corporate value. Sumitomo said it will communicate with Berkshire as with all other shareholders. 
Itochu Chairman Masahiro Okafuji in an emailed statement welcomed Buffett's interest in Japanese trading house stocks, which he said have lagged global financial markets, adding the investment ""will be a catalyst for revitalizing the industry.""
U.S. DEPENDENCE
Berkshire owns more than 90 businesses outright including the BNSF railroad and Geico car insurer outright.
It also invests in dozens of companies including  American Express  Co (N:AXP), Bank of America Corp (N:BAC) and  Coca-Cola Co  (N:KO). It has a roughly $125 billion stake in Apple Inc (O:AAPL) based on its holdings as of June 30.
""Buffett's portfolio is becoming heavily skewed to Apple, so maybe he was looking for something the complete opposite of Apple,"" said Monex chief strategist Hiroki Takashi in Tokyo.
Most of Berkshire's operating businesses are American, though it has acquired a handful of foreign companies including Israel's IMC International Metalworking and German motorcycle apparel retailer Detlev Louis.
Additional investments in Japan could also help reduce Berkshire's cash pile, which ended June at a record $146.6 billion.

The termination follows a July report by the U.S. Congress House Subcommittee on Economic and Consumer Policy that found the White House had overpaid Philips by at least $500 million. Philips denied any profiteering on ventilators.
Philips was one of several firms contracted by the U.S. to supply 187,000 ventilators to the strategic national stockpile to treat patients affected by COVID-19. 
It expanded capacity in Pennsylvania and California to meet sudden demand but said in a statement on Monday that it will now deliver just 12,300 hospital ventilators by the end of the year to the U.S. Department of Health and Human services.
A spokesman said he expected Philips will find other buyers for the 30,700 excess ventilators.
Shares in Philips, which are down 4.3% in the year to date, dipped 0.6% to 40.84 euros.
""We continue to expect to return to growth and improved profitability in the second half of the year, starting in the third quarter,"" Philips chief executive Frans van Houten said.
Philips had said in July that the surge in orders for medical equipment would enable it to achieve an ""adjusted EBITA (earnings before interest, taxes, and amortisation) margin improvement"" this year.
But it said on Monday it expects ""to deliver modest comparable sales growth with an adjusted EBITA margin of around the level of last year"".
Philips' core earnings fell almost a quarter in April-June to 418 million euros ($497.25 million) as sales dropped 6% to 4.4 billion euros.
ING, which rates Philips shares ""hold"", said in a note the news was a slight negative as analysts were already expecting flat margins this year.

588,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 31, 2020 06:35AM ET</span>",Norway fund excludes firms over human rights violation risk,"By Gwladys Fouche and Terje Solsvik
OSLO (Reuters) - Norway's $1 trillion wealth fund said it had excluded Taiwan's Formosa Chemicals and Fibre (TW:1326), Formosa Taffeta (TW:1434) and India's  Page Industries  (NS:PAGE) from its portfolio, saying they posed an ""unacceptable risk for violation of human rights"".
The world's largest sovereign wealth fund sells holdings before announcing such exclusions to avoid excessive market moves.
Formosa Chemicals and Fibre declined to comment. An official reached by telephone at Formosa Taffeta said the company was closed for the day. Page Industries was not immediately reachable for comment.
In recent years the fund, which operates under guidelines established by the Norwegian parliament, has focused on working conditions in textile factories in Asia, excluding companies it thinks pose an ethical risk to its investments.
Set up in 1996 to preserve Norway's oil revenues for future generations, the fund holds around 1.5% of globally listed shares and its decisions are often followed by other investors.
At the end of 2019, NBIM held a 0.84% stake in Formosa Chemicals & Fibre, valued at $144 million, and a 0.64% stake in Formosa Taffeta valued at $12.2 million.
The stake in Page Industries at that time stood at 0.42%, with a market value of $15.4 million.
The fund said in the statement that its management will also scrutinise oil firm PetroChina's (SS:601857) work, engaging in active ownership in the hope of boosting the company's anti-corruption practices.
PetroChina was not immediately available for comment.
PetroChina had been under observation for possible exclusion since 2017 and had not responded to inquiries from the fund's ethics watchdog, the Council on Ethics, Norges Bank said.
The board of the Norwegian central bank, which manages the fund, concluded ""active ownership"" was therefore appropriate.
The fund held 0.17% of PetroChina shares at the end of 2019, valued at $159.6 million. It did not say whether the stake had changed since the start of 2020.

The Swiss lender sought a licence from the Bank of Spain and the European Central Bank in July to upgrade its brokerage in the country to a bank, the spokesman said confirming the article that quoted Wenceslao  Bunge  (NYSE:BG), Credit Suisse's chief for Spain and Portugal.
The bank expects to get the licence within a year and to be fully operational by mid 2021.
In July, the EU's banking watchdog told banks using Britain as a gateway to the European Union to fully execute their plans for serving EU customers before a Brexit transition period ends in December.
Britain left the EU in January, but financial firms have unfettered access across the bloc under transition arrangements that end on December 31.. 
Credit Suisse said in a statement its priority has always been to ensure it maintained access to European Union clients and markets regardless of the outcomes of the Brexit process.
""Over the last three years, we have added to our existing capabilities in Spain, Germany and Luxembourg to provide this continuity for our clients. London will remain a key part of the bank’s strategy and footprint after the UK’s exit from the EU,” the bank said. 
The decision to move part of its operations to Madrid was made after considering costs, employees' preferences among other factors, Bunge told Expansion. ""We believe in the country and the advantages it offers. Spain has a very important competitiveness position,"" he said.
Many big banks have already opened up hubs in Frankfurt, Paris and elsewhere in the bloc to continue serving customers there, while EU banks in London like ING have begun shifting some staff home.

Credit Suisse has not determined how many staff it will transfer to Madrid from London, although 50 employees have already moved to the Spanish capital.

590,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 31, 2020 05:35AM ET</span>","Japan investors bet on Suga's Abenomics 2.0, buy travel stocks","By Hideyuki Sano and Stanley White
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese investors are putting their money on Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga taking over as Japan's next prime minister, and extending the economic policies that defined his predecessor's nearly eight years in office. 
They are betting Suga, the longtime lieutenant of outgoing prime minister Shinzo Abe who is stepping down for health reasons, will be able to secure enough votes among ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) lawmakers when they hold a leadership vote on Sept. 14. 
A Suga government will mean the economic, fiscal and reform policies of Abe, dubbed ""Abenomics"", will likely continue.
Telecom shares fell as Suga has a long-standing position of wanting to reduce mobile phone tariffs while travel-related shares soared as he said last week that he wanted to promote tourism to get the economy back on its feet.
The Nikkei bounced back and the yen regained some stability as investors expect Suga to continue policies with a focus on supporting stock prices.
""Markets are starting to price in a Suga government. He will be a successor to Abe's policies and there won't be a political vacuum,"" said Takashi Hiroki, chief strategist at Monex Securities.
The Nikkei (N225) rose 1.12% to 23,139.76, wiping out all of its losses on Friday following the surprise news of Abe's resignation. The yen also steadied at 105.62 per dollar .
The three mobile phone carriers were among the worst hit on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. KDDI (T:9432) dropped 4.7% and NTT Docomo (T:9437) lost 3.4%. SoftBank (T:9434), subsidiary of SoftBank Group (T:9984), shed 2.7%.
Some market players also said airlines and railways gained on hopes of further measures to help revive the economy.
Suga had told Reuters last week Japan wants to avert another state of emergency and needs to consider more stimulus to revive the pandemic-hit economy.
West Japan Railway (T:9021) gained 3.6%, Central Japan Railway (T:9022) rose 3.3% and ANA Holdings (T:9202) added 2.6%.
""Suga's stance will be to support the economy as much as possible while trying to avoid the collapse of the medical system,"" said Tetsuro Ii, president of Commons Asset Management. ""It's not that the stock market hugely likes him but he is well accepted."" 
Suga, who joins the race to take over from the country's longest-serving prime minister, will likely face off against former defence minister Shigeru Ishiba, which media polls show is the most popular choice among the public.
But the LDP is likely to use a voting method that limits the votes from rural party members, domestic media have reported, effectively blocking Ishiba's path to the prime minister's office.
Analysts say Ishiba, a rare critic of Abe within the LDP, would likely try to rein in the Bank of Japan's aggressive monetary easing, which could limit or end the central bank's exchange traded fund buying programme.
Japan's Government Pension Investment Fund, the world's largest, bought more overseas assets during Abe's administration than it did previously, including boosting purchases of Japanese equities.
These purchases could slow if the new prime minister is not committed to keeping Abe's policies in place, analysts say.
""Ishiba would try to overhaul Abenomics,"" said Norihiro Fujito, chief investment strategist, Mitsubishi UFJ (NYSE:MUFG)  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Securities.
""An Ishiba government is what the markets fear most, but Ishiba's chances have diminished greatly. As long as someone like Suga gets the job, policy continuity will calm markets.""
Fumio Kishida, a former foreign minister, and Environment Minister Shinjiro Koizumi have also been mentioned as possible successors to Abe, but analysts say neither politician has enough support to pose a serious challenge.

591,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 31, 2020 05:30AM ET</span>",StockBeat: Veolia's Move on Sues Merits Cautious Market Response,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- What’s not to like about Veolia’s move on Suez?
Certainly, there are no losers among the primary actors, judging by Monday’s share price reaction: Suez (PA:SEVI) stock was up 19%, Veolia (PA:VIE) stock was up 3.5% and Engie (PA:ENGIE) stock was up 6.0% after the weekend announcement that Veolia wants to buy almost all of Engie’s 32% stake in Suez, in a prelude to what it hopes will be a full merger.
A merged Veolia-Suez would be a formidable global force in water management, a good business to be in, given the likelihood that climate change and population growth will require much more efficient management of water resources for the foreseeable future. Veolia said the deal would create 500 million euros in greater operational efficiency almost immediately,
At the proposed price of 15.50 euros a share, Engie would get over 3 billion euros (some $3.5 billion) to strengthen its balance sheet and sharpen its focus on its energy business, positioning it nicely for the looming splurge on renewables promised as part of the EU’s pandemic recovery plans.
Engie had signalled that it was looking at doing just that a couple of months ago when it gave up its long-standing opposition to selling the Suez stake, so its cool response to Veolia’s approach at the weekend is a bit puzzling. Engie said it “will study this proposal in the coming weeks” and “give preference to the most attractive solution for its shareholders, with due respect to the stakeholders, and after taking into consideration the quality of the industrial project.”
The charitable interpretation to this is that Engie is simply playing hard to get while it tries to squeeze a bit more money out of Veolia.
However, the market is implying a non-negligible risk of the deal not going through: Even after their morning surge, Suez shares were still nearly a euro below the price offered by Veolia.
Antitrust concerns may be partly responsible for that, but Veolia said that it already has a commitment from Meridiam, an infrastructure management company, to buy its French water business. That would address the most acute monopoly issue.
That leaves personal and corporate rivalry as the other likely explanation. Veolia will still need the support of Suez’s management if it wants to keep the costs of a full offer down. Suez’s only response at the weekend was to note sourly that it hadn’t been consulted at all.
Suez CEO Bertrand Camus, a company lifer, may well need squaring with either a board position at Veolia or a highly sweetened exit package to support a full merger.
Meanwhile, Claire Waysande, Engie’s interim CEO since the departure of Isabelle Kocher in February, has spent almost all her working life in politics rather than business. She is not a natural candidate to put shareholder interests above those of other vested interests (sorry, ‘stakeholders’).
Tellingly, Veolia chief executive Antoine Frerot, in an interview with the Financial Times compared a possible merger to one between Manchester United and Manchester City to underline the scale of the powerhouse they would be creating. But anyone with even a passing interest in soccer would know that internal tensions would make the resulting monster acutely dysfunctional.
Unless the merger is done properly, the combined company will end up being worth less than the sum of its parts, and the 10 billion euros that it will have required will be just waste water down the drain."
592,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 31, 2020 05:20AM ET</span>",Vanguard's China fund market strategy under a cloud after Asia setbacks,"By Samuel Shen and Alun John
SHANGHAI/HONG KONG (Reuters) - As Vanguard Group doubles down on mainland China's $2.6 trillion mutual funds market, the U.S. asset manager faces challenges similar to those that forced it to abandon Hong Kong, Japan and Singapore.
The world's biggest mutual fund company announced last week it is closing its Hong Kong and Japan operations and shifting its Asian headquarters to Shanghai, where it is expected to establish a mutual fund unit. The Pennsylvania-based money manager exited Singapore two years ago.
""Vanguard failed in Singapore. It just failed in Hong Kong. Why do you think coming to the mainland is going to work?"" said Peter Alexander, founder of Z-Ben Advisors, who has worked in China's mutual fund industry since its inception in 1997.
Alexander and some other industry veterans argue Vanguard's direct-to-client, low-fee sales model, which proved so successful in North America, did not work in Hong Kong because it was poorly suited to most Asian markets where investment products are typically sold by agents who live on commission. That is incompatible with Vanguard's core tenet of never paying for distribution. China's 1.4 billion population appears enticing for Vanguard, especially the exchange-traded funds (ETFs) segment. The mainland's overall mutual funds market is forecast to more than triple to 60 trillion yuan ($8.75 trillion) in a decade, according to Z-Ben.
Several other international players including BlackRock (N:BLK), Fidelity and Neuberger Berman are also preparing to establish wholly owned retail fund businesses in China after foreign ownership restrictions were scrapped earlier this year.
But, like Hong Kong, China is a pay-to-access fund market where actively-managed products are more popular. And commission-based sales agents have little incentive to sell low-fee ETFs.
China's biggest ETF manager China Asset Management Co said ETFs were popular in the United States because beating benchmarks consistently was difficult there, and investment advisers often recommend low-cost products. However, in China investors regularly aspire to beat the market.
""Many global players know China is very important, but once the real fights begin they often find themselves unaccustomed to the local battle ground,"" said Jasper Yip, Hong Kong-based principal at management consultancy Oliver Wyman.
In a statement about its Asia strategy, Vanguard drew a parallel with widespread doubts about its pioneering - and ultimately hugely successful - index mutual funds when founder John Bogle launched them in the 70s.
""Just as we advise our clients to invest for the long term, as a firm, we also are patient and take the long view on our business strategies,"" the world's second-biggest ETF manager said.
To tap a growing online investment community, Vanguard has formed a minority-owned China investment advisory joint venture with the country's leading fintech company Ant Group.
Alexander of Z-Ben and other industry executives say Vanguard risks the same problems many other Sino-foreign ventures experienced: cultural clashes, and being sidelined. This is heightened because Ant controls the fund advisory business and has a majority stake in another Chinese mutual house which sells ETFs.
""There's no doubt that there will be power struggles in a JV,"" said a senior executive of a Chinese mutual fund house on condition of anonymity. ""I met some U.S. fund executives who are idealistic and want to replicate their U.S. practice in China. In reality, it doesn't work.""

593,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 31, 2020 05:09AM ET</span>",Orange CEO Pledges to Boost Dividend With Focus on Cost Cuts,"(Bloomberg) -- Orange SA (NYSE:ORAN), France’s biggest telecommunications company, pledged to restore the dividend to its pre-pandemic level as soon as this year and to be “ambitious” on cost savings.
Orange had cut its 2019 dividend to 50 cents from a target of 70 cents per share in April. It told investors in July that they would be informed by the end of the year if the payout goal would return to the previous level for 2020.
Chief Executive Officer Stephane Richard said in an interview Sunday he would “personally” ensure a return to the target. “My objective is to return to 70 cents a share as soon as this year, and we totally have the means to do it.”
More broadly, he will continue to pare costs at the company. “We’re totally determined to be more ambitious on the matter, on cost optimization.”
A price war in France and weakness in Spain, its two biggest markets, and the need to continue investment in its networks has been weighing on the company’s shares for years. Orange started a program in December to monetize its infrastructure and cut costs.
When asked if Orange was planning job cuts, Richard said there is a constant plan to reduce staff in France, and referred to its broader strategy.
The company has been making few replacements for staff that are retiring, and Richard said “is this going to continue? Yes.” Personnel reductions would focus on support and non-operational units, he said. He declined to give a target on headcount, but reiterated that the company’s December plan would still achieve 1 billion euros ($1.4 billion) of planned savings by 2023.
“We have a job to do on that,” he said. “It’s part of the transformation.”
Orange has tended to say little on actions to reduce headcount as it faced a criminal trial linked to a wave of employee suicides more than a decade ago. Ex-CEO Didier Lombard was found guilty of harassment and using “forbidden” methods to carry out staff cuts.
The 28% slump in Orange shares this year, under performing peers, raised questions among analysts on whether the company will retain its place in the Stoxx 50 index.
The company’s second-quarter results presented a mixed picture. While Orange added a record number of fiber broadband customers in the period, a reflection of its heavy investment, travel bans hit revenue from roaming fees and store closures weighed on equipment sales.
Meanwhile, it faces competition from domestic rivals Altice Europe NV’s SFR, Iliad SA and  Bouygues  (PA:BOUY) SA as they catch up on fiber.
“There is some speculation that Orange could be excluded from the Stoxx50 and it weighs on the stock’s performance. But it’s not just that,” Alexandre Iatrides, an analyst at Oddo BHF, said Friday. “Orange benefited in the past two to three years from its advance in fiber. But its competitors caught up and very clearly accelerated.”
Infrastructure Opportunities
Richard took the CEO role at the company in 2011. A removal from the benchmark would be a blow as it could result in substantial selling pressure from investors and exchange-traded funds that track the index.
“We make money, we hand out dividends, we produce cash flow, we have sales that are holding up, as we are massacred on the stock market,” said Richard, speaking in his office in Paris. “The economic reality of the company is totally forgotten.”
He said Orange wants to capitalize on opportunities to monetize its infrastructure. It’s selling mobile phone towers in Spain to Cellnex Telecom SA, and will set up separate companies to house its other cellular towers while looking for partners to help with network rollouts in France and elsewhere in Europe.
December’s five-year plan indicated the Spanish tower company would be created this year. Richard said Sunday that it would be created and operational by the end of 2021. He also said he envisioned more combinations in this sector in the future.
“There is going to be some sort of consolidation on tower companies in Europe,” including between operators, and Orange has had some discussions about this. “We had exchanges with Deutsche Telekom AG (DE:DTEGn) and  Vodafone  Group (LON:VOD) Plc at some points, but they are not advanced at all.”
The virus-related confinement in France before the summer has delayed Orange Concessions, the project to monetize its French fiber infrastructure. Richard said Orange plans to find its financial partner for the dedicated vehicle in 2021, later than the end-2020 planned deadline. He said there is “a lot of appetite for these assets,” and said there could be two investors.
Investor Disaffection
Amid the activity to make more out of Orange’s assets, he said the company’s share performance reflects a “disaffection” that has developed among investors regarding the industry. They also have a “a sentiment that the short operational perspectives of Orange are under performing other operators, and this comes essentially from two markets: France and Spain.”
He said there was reason for “optimism” for the company’s Spanish business in the third quarter. It remains under pressure from competitors including Masmovil on prices, though with its new management starting on Tuesday it can turn around the situation in the next 18 months, Richard said.
However, the levels also reflect that hedge funds have “played on an Orange exit,” he said. “They are massively shorting the stock.”
“‘I am violently opposed to these practices,” he said. “This isn’t the way financial markets should work because the economic reality of companies is totally forgotten.”

594,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 31, 2020 05:05AM ET</span>","World stocks hold firm, set for fifth straight month of gains","By Dhara Ranasinghe
LONDON (Reuters) - World stocks hovered near record highs on Monday and were set to end August with five consecutive months of gains, as investors bet on central banks keeping up the policy punchbowl for years to come. 
An upbeat reading on China's service sector added to the positive mood, with MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan (MIAPJ0000PUS) touching its highest since March 2018. 
News that French water and waste firm Veolia hopes to buy a near 30% stake in smaller peer Suez for 2.9 billion euros boosted European markets (STOXX), with bourses in Paris (FCHI), Frankfurt (GDAXI) and Milan <.FTMIIB> up 0.5-0.9%. 
London was closed for a public holiday, while U.S. stock futures pointed to a positive open for Wall Street (ESc1) (1YMc1).
That left MSCI's world equity index (MIWD00000PUS) near record high levels. It has risen over 6% in August, set for its fifth straight month of gains. 
Massive monetary and fiscal stimulus has bolstered stock markets in recent months, overpowering concern about the outlook for a world economy battered by the coronavirus. 
Fed Chair Jerome Powell boosted stock markets last week by committing to keep inflation at 2% on average, allowing prices to run hotter to balance periods when they undershot.
The risk of higher inflation in the future, assuming the Fed can get it there, was enough to push up longer-term Treasury yields and sharply steepen the yield curve.
Yields on 30-year bonds (US30YT=RR) jumped almost 16 basis points last week and were last at 1.50%, 137 basis points above the two-year yield. The spread was now approaching the June gap of 146 basis points, the largest since late 2017.
""We know now the Fed is behind inflation and will be less strict than before, so it would be logical to see higher yields,"" said Eric Vanraes, fixed income portfolio manager at Eric Sturdza Investments in Geneva.
""But at the same time, we are in a tough situation regarding the economy and the Fed cannot allow a huge steepening of the curve, otherwise its efforts to fight the crisis would have been destroyed,"" he said. 
""At some point, I think we will see a correction in equities but not a collapse, and that would be normal and good news for the market because equity levels are too high and disconnected to the economic reality and earnings.""
A host of Federal Reserve officials are set to speak this week, kicking off with Vice Chair Richard Clarida later Monday.
Tokyo's Nikkei (N225) closed up more than 1%, buoyed by news Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (N:BRKa) had bought more than 5% stakes in each of the five leading Japanese trading companies.
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's resignation on Friday had hurt shares on concern about future fiscal and monetary stimulus policies. Such worries were allayed somewhat by news Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga, a close ally of Abe, would join the race to succeed his boss. A slimmed-down leadership contest is likely around Sept. 14.
DOLLAR RECOVERY 
The dollar firmed against its peers but was set for its fourth straight month of losses. 
The dollar index rose 0.26% to 92.426 (=USD), nudging off recent two-year lows. It was 0.5% firmer at 105.87 yen , while the euro was a touch softer at $1.1885 (EUR=EBS), having climbed 0.9% last week. 
The Fed's shift to an average inflation target was likely to continue to weigh on the greenback, analysts said. 
""Even if U.S. central bankers are likely to be pleased about the interpretation of their measures, it is not good news for the dollar,"" Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) analysts said in a note. 
Elsewhere, the dollar rebound weighed on gold, which fell 0.3% to at $1,957 an ounce . 
Brent crude oil touched its highest in five months, underpinned by a 30% cut in Abu Dhabi crude supplies and encouraging Chinese data.

Brent crude futures (LCOc1) rose to $46.46 a barrel, the highest since March, and was last up 1.4%. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude (CLc1) was at $43.35 a barrel, up 38 cents, or 0.9%.

(Reuters) - European shares rose on Monday as heavyweight oil and gas players were supported by higher crude prices and merger talks in major French utilities saw the sector outperform regional peers.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index (STOXX) rose 0.5%, adding to mild gains from the prior week amid some optimism over COVID-19 treatments. A British market holiday seemed likely to keep trading volumes subdued for the day.
The STOXX 600 was set to add nearly 4% for August. Still, it remains way off pre-pandemic highs as middling economic data and a resurgence in COVID-19 cases put the index in a roughly 30-point trading range since June.Suez (PA:SEVI) topped the STOXX 600 after larger peer Veolia (PA:VIE) offered to buy a 29.9% stake in the French water and waste firm from gas and power utility Engie (PA:ENGIE) for 2.9 billion euros.
Suez jumped nearly 20% and was set for its best day ever, while Veolia and Engie added about 3.6% and 6%, respectively. Their gains spurred a more than 1% rise in the European utility sector (SX6P), which outpaced its regional peers. 
Oil and gas stocks (SXEP) rose more than 1% as hopes of more global stimulus measures and a recovery in Chinese demand propped up crude prices. [O/R] 
Activity in China's services sector expanded at a much faster pace in August, official data showed, as demand across the economy continues to recover from a coronavirus-induced slump.
China-sensitive sectors such as automobiles (SXAP) and resource miners (SXPP) also rose. Both sectors depend on the country for their supply chains and is a major market as well.
Hopes of more accommodative measures by major central banks, in line with the U.S. Federal Reserve's stance last week, also supported the outlook for equities.
""We see the move in Fed policy as confirming an important shift that could also put pressure on other central banks — such as the European Central Bank — to tolerate higher levels of inflation,"" Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management, wrote in a note.

German stocks (GDAXI) rose about 0.6%, ahead of preliminary inflation data for August, due later in the day. Inflation readings for the EU bloc are also due later in the week, and are expected to be far below the ECB's target rate.

598,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 31, 2020 04:35AM ET</span>",Mitsubishi Motors says former chairman Masuko dead at 71,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Mitsubishi Motors (OTC:MMTOF) Corp's (T:7211) former chairman Osamu Masuko has died from heart failure, the Japanese automaker said in a statement on Monday. He was 71.
Masuko, a veteran of the Mitsubishi conglomerate, had just weeks ago resigned as chairman citing health reasons. He became the automaker's president in 2005, and oversaw the creation of the partnership between Mitsubishi and Nissan (OTC:NSANY) Motor Co (T:7201).
Mitsubishi Motors said he died on Aug. 27.
""(H)e built solid relationships with the management of partners, the Alliance companies and the Mitsubishi Group through good communications by leveraging his personality and extensive connections,"" the company said.
The former chairman's death comes as the alliance between Mitsubishi, Nissan and French automaker  Renault  SA (PA:RENA) struggles to regain profitability in the aftermath of the ouster of former alliance chairman Carlos Ghosn.
Masuko was at the helm of Mitsubishi during a 2016 scandal in which the automaker was found to have overstated the mileage on its vehicles. An investigation uncovered slack governance and pressure on resource-starved engineers as chronic issues at the company.
The scandal - Mitsubishi's third in two decades - pummeled profits and further tarnished the automaker' s brand. At the height of the furore, Nissan lent its smaller rival a lifeline, offering it $2.2 billion for a 34% controlling stake.
The deal was agreed between Masuko and then Nissan CEO Ghosn, and brought Mitsubishi in as a junior partner in the Nissan-Renault automotive alliance. 
Masuko later denounced his ties with Ghosn following the latter's 2018 arrest in Japan over suspected financial misconduct.
All three members of the alliance are currently mired in financial problems, after years of aggressive expansion policies under Ghosn's leadership resulted in falling vehicle sales.

A further drop in global car demand due to the coronavirus pandemic has exacerbated these problems, and Mitsubishi, Nissan and Renault are each bracing for steep annual operating losses this year.

605,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 30, 2020 07:20PM ET</span>",Chinese investors snap up Hong Kong property as new security law deters foreigners,"By Clare Jim
HONG KONG (Reuters) - Mainland Chinese investors are scouring Hong Kong's commercial property market for bargains after prices plunged 30%, signalling a new wave of demand following anti-government protests last year that kept a lid on investment activity. 
Property agents expect the influx of Chinese capital, which has helped Hong Kong become one of the world's most expensive property markets, can once again prop up the sector as China recovers from the COVID-19 pandemic and stands ready to deploy liquidity.
In August alone, mainland buyers snapped up at least two office towers and one hotel building worth HK$4 billion ($516 million) in total, according to agents and filings. 
""A majority of recent large-value building deals were bought by Chinese investors; their number has really grown in the third quarter,"" said Reeves Yan, head of capital markets at CBRE Hong Kong.
""They're looking for bargains ... and they're confident in Hong Kong in the long term.""
The pick-up in demand coincides with the imposition of a national security law in Hong Kong on June 30, which authorities in Beijing and the financial centre have said is necessary to ensure its stability and prosperity.
""We expect to see more mainland investors coming to buy land,"" said Dennis Cheng, senior sales director at Ricacorp (C.I.R.) Properties. 
""If Hong Kong gets more stable in the next few months after the national security law, we expect more mainland companies to open branches here, and that will help the office sector to recover."" 
The move by Chinese investors is in stark contrast to foreign investors, who are staying away due to growing concerns over the city's future. Critics of the legislation say it has pushed the former British colony onto a more authoritarian path following months of sometimes violent democracy protests last year. 
""Foreign investors are still absent. I spoke to two foreign funds recently who said they won't consider Hong Kong at the moment because the political risks are relatively high now,"" said Daniel Wong, CEO of Midland IC&I. 
EARLY SIGNS 
In July, state-owned China Mobile (NYSE:CHL) and a consortium led by Chinese major developer Vanke bought one land parcel each for HK$5.6 billion and HK$3.7 billion, respectively. They were the first mainland Chinese companies to win public tenders since January.
Colliers says it expected mainland capital will become ""the next wave of demand"" in the Hong Kong leasing and investment markets, supported by cross-border financial initiatives in stock and wealth management, and the city's large capital pool for fund-raising. 
China called on its biggest state firms to take a more active role in Hong Kong, including stepping up investment and asserting more control of companies to help cool last year's political crisis, Reuters reported (https://www.reuters.com/article/us-hongkong-protests-soe-exclusive/exclusive-china-prods-state-firms-to-boost-investment-in-crisis-hit-hong-kong-idUSKCN1VY08C) last year.
It is unclear, however, whether the latest spike in investment is being driven by Beijing, because while some of the buyers are government-backed, many of them are private investors. 
But the city recorded a plunge in deal volume amid the unrest and the pandemic and has yet to witness a rise in mainland investments comparable to a few years ago. 
""There are early signs of mainland Chinese demand returning,"" Colliers said in a recent note. 
Chinese investment accounted of 39% of total commercial real estate transactions in Hong Kong so far this year, up from 19% for the whole of 2019, Colliers said.

CBRE's Yan expects the commercial property market to bottom-out soon as deal volumes accelerate in the fourth quarter. He cautioned, however, that prices of office and retail shops will remain under pressure for another 12-18 months as the economy slowly recovers.

Jack Ma’s Chinese financial titan aims to raise at least $30 billion in Hong Kong and Shanghai in October, which could push global first-time share sales by tech firms well past $57 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That would be the highest since 1999, when tech companies raised $62 billion and famously ushered in a plethora of now-defunct internet outfits.
After an initial pandemic-induced lull, corporate share sales have come back with a vengeance, luring many of the same investors who pushed Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL).’s market cap past the $2 trillion mark and ignited a broad rally in internet companies worldwide.
Ant joins a stampede of companies that began trying to sell shares in recent weeks, from food delivery behemoth DoorDash Inc. to Airbnb Inc. July’s almost $19 billion in new listings was the busiest month for U.S. IPOs since September 2014, when 36 companies including Ant-affiliate  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd. went public while raising $36 billion.
“The multiple environment for technology companies is at the highest since the dotcom bubble,” said Lauren Cummings, co-head of technology equity capital markets for the Americas at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS). “2020 is the year a lot of companies are going public but there are still many high quality companies, probably multiple times of what we have this year, that are quality companies, that are scaled, that can go public next year.”

Investors have questioned whether a 2020 run-up that’s lifted marquee names from Apple and  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB). to Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) Ltd. is fueling a bubble akin to that of two decades ago, which brought down much of the fledgling internet economy when it popped. Beyond the fundamentals however, there are several unique aspects to this year’s tech mania.
One is sheer size. Ant’s giant offering may skew comparisons with 1999, particularly if it surpasses Saudi Aramco’s $29 billion IPO last year as the largest in history.
The past year has featured an unusual number of first-time share sales on Hong Kong or mainland bourses by Chinese companies already listed abroad, fearing a backlash from an increasingly belligerent Trump administration. They include Alibaba, JD (NASDAQ:JD).com Inc. and top chipmaker Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp.

The rise of the hyper-local ChiNext and Star markets in China has also inflated 2020’s pipeline. Punters on the mainland have gobbled up loss-making debutantes like never before -- triggering first-day rallies of more than 2,000% in some cases -- in part because they believe Beijing will offer financial and other forms of aid for a Chinese tech sector perceived as essential given the Trump administration’s restrictions on trade.
Finally, the unknown extent of the global economic downturn caused by the pandemic has led some companies to rethink their capital needs or speed up plans. Airbnb, which was previously seen as a candidate for a direct listing, said this month it filed for a traditional initial public offering. Last week, on Monday alone, four biomedical companies, four blank-check companies and five software companies, including Unity Software Inc., filed to go public.
“The year has been really busy for equity capital markets deals so far despite all the headline news,” said Tucker Highfield, co-head of equity capital markets for Asia Pacific at Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC).. “We expect to see strong IPO markets to the end of year as investors continue to look for higher returns.”

CHICAGO (Reuters) - United Airlines (O:UAL) said on Sunday it is permanently eliminating change fees on tickets for U.S. travel effective immediately, the latest effort by a U.S. airline to try to stimulate bookings hit by the coronavirus pandemic.
Chicago-based United is among the major U.S. airlines that began implementing temporary waivers of change fees this year to give passengers more flexibility with their travel plans given the uncertainty surrounding the pandemic.
Now it is making the policy permanent for all standard Economy and Premium cabin tickets and also applying it to any ticket already booked through the end of the year. The standard change fee - charged to passengers who change their tickets - for domestic flights was $200.
In a video message to customers, Chief Executive Scott Kirby (NYSE:KEX) said getting rid of fees is often a top request from passengers. 
The move matches Southwest Airlines' (N:LUV) long-standing policy of not charging fees for ticket changes.
Rivals American Airlines (O:AAL) and Delta Air Lines (N:DAL) traditionally do charge for changes. Along with United, they were booking record revenues before the pandemic crushed demand, thanks largely to fees for things like checking luggage or choosing a seat.
In another change, beginning Jan. 1 United will allow customers to list for stand-by for free on a different flight on the same day of travel with the same departure and arrival cities if a seat is available.
Kirby called the moves a departure from decisions airlines had made in the past to survive difficult times, sometimes at the expense of customer service, saying United ""won't be following that same playbook as we come out of this crisis."" 

Airlines are burning through millions of dollars daily because of the pandemic, but agree that restoring customer confidence and providing travel flexibility will be key to encouraging people to start traveling again and pave the path back to profitability.

610,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 30, 2020 11:10AM ET</span>",Japan's Eneos to hasten refinery consolidation as virus slams demand at home,"By Yuka Obayashi and Ritsuko Shimizu
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's biggest oil refiner Eneos Holdings Inc (T:5020) will hasten its transformation into a supplier of low-carbon energy and materials as domestic oil demand drops more than expected due to the COVID-19 pandemic, new President Katsuyuki Ota said. 
A quicker timeline comes amid a wider consolidation in Japan's refining sector, which has been cutting capacity as it struggles to get business from a shrinking, ageing population that consumes less fuel because of more efficient vehicles.
Eneos, formerly JXTG, unveiled last year its long-term plan to transform with an assumption that domestic oil demand would halve by 2040, or fall 2% annually. It said in May 2020 it would spend 1.5 trillion yen ($14 billion) in three years to March 2023 to drive the change.
But ""Japan's oil demand may not return to the levels we had anticipated before the pandemic"", said Ota, who became president in June. ""We need to tackle various reforms faster"" to develop growth businesses such as renewable energy and streamline the refinery structure, he added. 
""It would not only mean shutting refineries down, but also turning them into chemical refineries or energy platforms for electric power, hydrogen and others.""
To this end, Eneos' refineries in a petrochemical complex in Kashima, east of Tokyo, and Mizushima, western Japan, among others have potential, Ota said. 
Eneos operates 11 refineries with 1.93 million barrels per day (bpd) capacity. Their run rate in April-June plunged to 68%, lowest since 2010, as the pandemic slammed demand.
It has already decided to stop refining at its 115,000 bpd Osaka refinery, and teamed up with Mitsubishi Chemical to strengthen petrochemical refining at their plants in Kashima. 
The end of refining at Eneos' Osaka plant will cut Japan's overall capacity to just over 3.4 million bpd, from 5.94 million bpd in the 1980s.
Graphic - Japan refining capacity Japan refining capacity: https://graphics.reuters.com/ENEOS-STRATEGY/xklpynnoevg/chart.png
To cope with sliding demand, four of Japan's biggest oil companies have merged into two, Eneos and Idemitsu Kosan (T:5019), in recent years.
Ota said further alliances would likely be with players in other industries such as electricity, gas and chemicals.
Eneos is still in talks with  Vietnam National Petroleum Group  (Petrolimex) (HM:PLX) to collaborate on refinery projects, and it eyes renewable energy projects in Australia to make CO2-free hydrogen, he said.

612,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 30, 2020 09:07AM ET</span>","Pure Gold, Miner ETFs Add Luster to Portfolios in Uncertain Times","By Christiana Sciaudone
Investing.com -- Gold has been hitting record highs recently. Are gold ETFs overdone?
Probably not, says Dan Weiskopf, a portfolio manager at Toroso Investments whose Twitter handle is @ETFProfessor. 
""We're dealing in a world that has a lot of unknowns,"" Weiskopf said in a phone interview. ""Gold's a good place for everyone's portfolio.""
The U.S. dollar may fall apart, the world is printing money relentlessly. At some point inflation will be needed to pay it back -- Gold Futures can protect investors from that issue.   
The question becomes how much and how do you play the metal, Weiskopf said. There are both pure play ETFs and gold miner ETFs to consider.
To the pure plays: SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE:GLD) -- the largest gold ETF in the world by assets at $77 billion and the largest commodities ETF trading in the U.S. -- and SPDR Gold MiniShares (NYSE:GLDM) offer essentially the same product. GLDM has about $3.3 billion in assets, and the same sponsor. The difference is that each GLD share represents 1/10th of an ounce of gold to GLDM's 1/100th of an ounce of gold. Additionally, GLDM's annual expense ratio is 0.18% compared to GLD's 0.4%. 
And that's the key, said Todd Rosenbluth, head of ETF & mutual fund research at CFRA.
""GLD is the heavyweight, it's where institutional investors have long gone to put money to work but there are cheaper alternatives,"" Rosenbluth said in a phone interview last week.
He points not only to GLDM, but also to GraniteShares Gold Trust (NYSE:BAR) -- BAR, where the expense is about half and the exposure is the same.  
""For a retail investor who is unlikely to be trading in size, GLDM, BAR and others like it are extremely appropriate ways of getting exposure to gold,"" Rosenbluth said. 
When it comes to miners, Rosenbluth likes VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX) -- GDX, which includes Newmont Goldcorp Corp (NYSE:NEM), Franco-Nevada Corporation (NYSE:FNV), and Wheaton Precious Metals (NYSE:WPM). 
""We think that fundamentals for these companies look positive,"" Rosenbluth said.  
VanEck Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDXJ) is a similar bet, but on smaller cap companies. 
Rosenbluth points out that pure gold ETFs have less potential upside and downside than stock-based ETFs. For example, GLD is up 25% over the past year, while GDX rose 35% and GDXJ increased 37%.

613,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 30, 2020 09:05AM ET</span>",Point/Counterpoint: The Case for Hotel Stocks,"By Peter Nurse and Yasin Ebrahim
Investing.com -- Of all the sectors of the U.S. economy that were hit hard when Covid-19 arrived, very few fared as badly as hotels. After all, the pandemic forced thousands of holiday makers and business travelers to cancel bookings and stay at home to contain the spread of the deadly virus.
Marriott International (NASDAQ:MAR), the hotel operator that also owns the Ritz-Carlton and St. Regis luxury brands, said that revenue per available room - a metric the industry uses to track performance - plummeted 90% worldwide by April.
Share prices were crushed.
But the worst may be behind the industry, with opportunities for investors to get in at a low point. Investing.com's Peter Nurse argues the bull case for hotels, while Yasin Ebrahim explains why the short-term looks painful for the sector. This is Point/Counterpoint.
The Bull Case: Nowhere To Go But Up
There has been a bounce over the last couple of months as travel restrictions and social distancing measures eased. Still, Marriott’s stock is down over 30% year-to-date and  Hilton Worldwide  Holdings Inc (NYSE:HLT) is 20% lower. This creates an opportunity.
“We expect the industry to enter a new multi-year growth cycle beginning early 2021; the best time to invest in lodging stocks is usually ahead of the start of the cycle and in the early innings of the cycle,"" said analysts at Barclays in June, while upgrading both Marriott and Hilton Worldwide to overweight.
The situation has got better since then, but with only small improvements in the stock prices.
Marriott reported in its second-quarter report, released in early August, that its worldwide revenue per available room declined 70% for the month of July, an improvement from the drop of 90% in April. Hilton saw a fall of 81%.
“While we have a long journey in front of us, we are on the road to recovery and look forward to the opportunities ahead,"" said Christopher J. Nassetta, president and chief executive officer of Hilton, during the company’s second-quarter earnings release.
Meanwhile, pharmaceutical companies around the world are striving night and day to create a vaccine or therapeutic treatments for the Covid-19 virus, which would enable society to return to something approaching normalcy.
Then there’s the potential for consolidation in the sector.
Over in Europe, a report emerged last week that  Accor  (PA:ACCP) was looking into a tie-up with U.K.-based InterContinental Hotels Group PLC (LON:IHG), a potential deal that would create the world’s largest hotel operator.
Nothing has come from that report yet, but just the thought of it was enough to prompt share price gains for the two companies as investors appreciated the idea of increased market share and potential cost savings through economies of scale.
While cash burn remains an issue, the major operators in the U.S. could well be looking at M&A with valuations beaten down throughout the sector.
""While Covid-19 remains a significant challenge in the near term, the worst for revenue per available room growth looks to be in the past and near-term demand trends in several segments have improved, giving companies a chance to reduce cash burn and emerge in a better-than-feared financial position post-crisis,” added  Barclays  (LON:BARC).
The Bear Case: The Deadbeat List of Short-Term Investments
Travel. . . Be it for business, or leisure, it's the heartbeat of the hotel industry. So, it comes as little surprise that the latest findings, in the wake of the pandemic, suggests hotels belong on the deadbeat list of investments over the short-term.  
STR, a division of  CoStar Group  (NASDAQ:CSGP) that provides market data on the hotel industry worldwide, projected that U.S. revenue per available room, RevPAR, a key performance measure for the hotel industry, will decline 52.3% for 2020, while ADR and occupancy will slip 20.9% and 39.7%, respectively.
Like many other pandemic-hit industries, a coronavirus vaccine is the silver bullet to return a sense of normalcy, but putting money to work on hopes an effective vaccine will be found sooner rather later, raises eyebrows in the world of investing.
The commentary from key hotel operators in the industry also suggest a wait-and-see approach may be the way to go as the clouds of doom overshadowing the industry are unlikely to depart anytime soon.
Hilton Worldwide estimated earlier this week it would take at least two years for demand to rebound to pre-coronavirus levels.
There are those, however, who would argue that the worst of the pandemic is behind us, likely ushering a faster pace of reopenings globally, which would improve capacity, boosting growth for hotels.
But while new cases in the U.S. appear to be declining, others parts of the developed world is starting to see a resurgence in infections, raising fears that a second wave of the pandemic beckons.
A second wave could see the U.S. take measures to limit international travel, which could hurt growth and more than offset any potential boost in domestic travel.
""Normally, humans are driven by FOMO — the fear of missing out,"" says Constance Hunter, chief economist at KPMG. ""But with the virus, they’re driven by FOGO — the fear of going out. If we have a second wave, that could undermine confidence to the point that FOGO will rise, and then you’ll see these knock-on effects. The ability to create this firewall around the COVID-impacted economy will start to erode even further.""
There are just too many unknows over the short term, which is never good basis on which to invest – and the smart money like hedge funds are starting to circle.
Hedge funds are building up bearish positions on funds that have outsized exposure to hotel debt on expectations that bankruptcies loom. 
In the past month, CMBX 9,  a U.S. credit-derivatives index with outsized exposure to hotel debt, has seen ""more selling pressure than any of the other CMBS indices,"" said Dan McNamara, a principal at MP Securitized Credit Partners, a hedge fund focused on shorting commercial mortgage bonds. ""That’s because some hedge funds are actively looking to play the short side on the Series 9 index due to its significant hotel exposure.""
With the odds stacked in a favor of a second wave rather than a vaccine, a short-term bet on hotels is for those who like to ride the wave of ""hopium,"" which more often has proved a quick way to lose money.

All five reported their biggest profit falls in at least a decade and an increase in soured loans when announcing their half-year results on Sunday and last week.
The results highlight the impact of the pandemic and the economic slowdown on Chinese banks that bucked the first-quarter global trend with higher profits and steady bad loans. 
Agricultural Bank of China (OTC:ACGBF) Ltd (SS:601288) (HK:1288) (AgBank) said ""the lagging impact of the epidemic and the risk of uncertainty are expected to be further transmitted to the banking industry,"" in its half-year results on Sunday. 
China Construction Bank (OTC:CICHF) Corp (CCB) (SS:601939) (HK:0939), the country's second-largest lender by assets, said it plans to assess credit risks and up provisions, just as Bank of China Ltd (SS:601988) (HK:3988) (BoC) said the same.
Even more directly, Bank of Communications Co Ltd (SS:601328) (HK:3328) said on Friday it had boosted ""provisions to counter the future impact of the pandemic.""
As the pandemic batters economies globally, BoC, the most international of China's large state banks, said it would keep guarding against global financial market risks in the second half.
SLIM MARGINS
Net interest margins (NIM) - a key gauge of bank profitability - fell at Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) (HK:1398), (SS:601398), the world's largest commercial lender by assets, BoCom, CCB and AgBank. 
But at BoC, NIM improved slightly to 1.82% from 1.8% three months earlier.
AgBank's fell to 2.14% at the end of June from 2.17% at the end of March, while at ICBC it narrowed to 1.98% at the end of the second quarter, from 2.2% at the end of the first.
Non-performing loan (NPL) ratios rose at the big five banks during the reporting period, with that of ICBC increasing to 1.5% by the end of June from 1.43% three months earlier, and that of CCB rising by 0.07 percentage points in second quarter to 1.49%.
Chinese commercial banks overall posted a 9.4% drop in first-half net profit to 1 trillion yuan, according to data from the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission.

By the end of the June quarter, the average nonperforming loan ratio for commercial banks was at 1.94%, commission data showed, the highest since 2009.

Hungary announced on Friday that it would close its borders to foreigners from Sept. 1 to curb a rise in infections and Hungarians returning from abroad will have to go into quarantine.
Wizz Air said in a statement that it would operate 32 flights per week between Sept. 7 and 30, down from around 126 flights in the Sept. 1-6 period.

The German stock exchange operator said earlier the creditors had filed the suit in a New York court seeking to require Clearstream to surrender assets that allegedly belong to Iran's central bank. It said the clearing house considers the claims to be unfounded and will take steps to defeat them.
Amir Hossein Tayyebi Fard, a deputy governor of the Iranian central bank, said in a statement: ""After repeated legal defeats in Luxembourg, the U.S. plaintiffs are seeking legal action in U.S. courts against Clearstream. Serious legal action is also underway to counter these measures.""
Tayyebi Fard did not give details of the bank's legal measures to prevent a seizure of the assets which he said were worth $1.7 billion, according to the statement posted on the bank's website.
U.S. authorities have targeted Luxembourg-based Clearstream for years in an investigation over whether it violated U.S. money laundering and Iran sanction laws. Deutsche Boerse has denied wrongdoing.
In 2019, a Luxembourg court refused to enforce a U.S. ruling that would have helped families of victims of the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks claim Iranian assets held with Clearstream.
In 2012, a New York court found there was evidence to show that Iran provided “material support and resources to al Qaeda for acts of terrorism”. The militant group carried out the hijacked plane attacks on New York and Washington.
That court awarded the plaintiffs damages of over $7 billion. Iran denies any links to Al Qaeda or any involvement in the Sept. 11 attacks.

619,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 29, 2020 03:50AM ET</span>","Wall Street Week Ahead: Value bulls bang drum for cheap stock resurgence on Fed, vaccine hopes","By Rodrigo Campos
NEW YORK (Reuters) - As U.S. stocks hit record highs, some investors are betting the market’s future gains will be increasingly driven by some of its lesser-loved companies. 
Value stocks - shares of economically sensitive companies trading at multiples that are usually below those found on growth names - have been among the laggards in the market’s blistering rally from its March lows. 
Some investors believe the relative cheapness of value stocks, which include energy companies, banks and industrial conglomerates, will catapult them to leadership if the nascent U.S. economic revival gains momentum, shifting focus from the big technology-related stocks that have led markets during the coronavirus pandemic.
The Russell 1000 Value index trades at almost 18 times earnings, up from 14 a year ago, and is up some 45% since late March. By comparison, the Russell 1000 Growth index trades at a multiple of 31, up from 22, and has gained over 70% in the same period.
""It's an important part of validating the market's rise, to have cyclicals and value sectors move,"" said Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research.
""At the end of the day I think value can outperform, but it's going to be very episodic.""
(Graphic: Russell 1000 Forward P/E ratios - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/WEEKAHEAD/nmovaqqwwva/chart.png)
Hopes of economic healing got a second wind Thursday, when Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell rolled out a sweeping policy rewrite that puts more focus on fighting unemployment than controlling inflation, sending shares of banks like  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) and  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) higher on the day. 
Investors in the coming week will be keeping a close eye on Friday’s U.S. non-farm payrolls data, looking for a snapshot of how the country’s economic recovery is faring.
Other arguments for a value resurgence have been fueled by signs of progress on a vaccine against COVID-19, which some investors believe could accelerate business reopenings and a return to in-person schooling across the United States. 
U.S. President Donald Trump has said a vaccine for the novel coronavirus could be available before the Nov. 3 presidential election, sooner than most experts anticipate. 
Some analysts, including those at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), believe a vaccine could be approved as early as the end of this year.
That could take the S&P 500 as high as 3,700 by year-end and spur a rotation to value names, especially if the news flow regarding a vaccine continues to be encouraging, Goldman’s analysts said earlier this month. The index recently hovered near 3,500.
Plenty of market participants doubt value will return anytime soon, or that such a move can be timed profitably. 
Value sectors such as retail have struggled for years with lackluster earnings or business models that are being disrupted in a shift to a more tech-driven world, a process that accelerated during the coronavirus pandemic. 
""Valuation alone doesn't drive stock prices. It’s the combination of valuation and improving fundamentals,"" said Richard Bernstein, chief executive officer and chief investment officer at Richard Bernstein Advisors in New York.
""For value to outperform, one typically needs profit growth to accelerate. That’s not happening yet,"" he said. 
BofA Global Research points out that value stocks have led during the recovery from every one of the last 14 recessions. 
Yet it also warns of ""value traps"" - stocks whose prices are falling faster than earnings are deteriorating. Such stocks have underperformed broader markets by four percentage points a year since 1997, the bank said.
BofA’s model identified energy and brick-and-mortar retail as sectors where value traps can be found.

Kim Forrest, chief investment officer at Bokeh Capital Partners, believes resurgences in value may be a thing of the past.
Technology has transformed the way companies deal with their inventory and altered the business cycle, sapping the benefits cyclical companies would receive from an upswing in growth, she said.
""There are some dinosaurs that don't get that the comet has hit and the (investment) environment has changed,"" said Forrest.
Others, like Bill Smead of Smead Capital Management, remain hopeful.
An eventual rise in inflation could boost the shares of energy companies, banks and home builders, which have tended to perform better when consumer prices trend higher, Smead said in a note to investors. 
Even longtime value bulls like Smead can have their fortitude tested, however.

""We are patient, but that patience doesn’t last forever,"" he wrote.

The social media company said on Wednesday it had removed the page for the Kenosha Guard, and an event listing there for Armed Citizens to Protect Our Lives and Property as it violated the company's policy against ""militia organizations"".
Facebook's action came after two people were shot and killed during protests in the town on Tuesday night, part of three nights of civil unrest that followed the shooting by a white police officer that left a Black man, Jacob Blake Jr, paralyzed.
Zuckerberg, speaking in a video message published on his Facebook profile, acknowledged the company had received complaints from ""a bunch of people"" about the Kenosha Guard posting.
""The contractors and reviewers who the initial complaints were funneled to basically didn't pick this up,"" he said. ""And on second review, doing it more sensitively, the team that's responsible for dangerous organizations recognized that this violated the policies and we took it down.""
Zuckerberg said the company had not found any evidence to show that the person charged with the fatal shooting during Tuesday's unrest followed the Kenosha Guard page.
News website BuzzFeed quoted an internal Facebook report as showing the event associated with the Kenosha Guard was flagged at least 455 times, and a Facebook worker as saying it accounted for 66% of all event reports that day.
Facebook declined to comment on those finding, Buzzfeed said. 
Facebook said it would continue to evolve its policies for identifying potentially dangerous organizations.

""This is a new policy we launched last week and we're still scaling up our enforcement of it by a team of specialists,"" a spokesperson said.

The world's biggest asset manager by assets got the green light on Aug. 21 to form a wholly-owned subsidiary in Shanghai, the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) said on its website late on Friday.
The unit would expand BlackRock's presence in China's fast-growing asset management market, where it already has a mutual fund venture with Bank of China, and is setting up a wealth management venture with Temasek and China Construction Bank (CCB) (HK:0939).
It also operates a private fund unit in Shanghai.
China opened its giant financial sector to foreign companies this year as part of an interim trade deal with the United States signed in January. 
BlackRock and Neuberger Berman applied to set up mutual fund units on April 1, when Beijing scrapped foreign ownership caps in the sector. Fidelity International has also submitted an application, while several other asset managers, including  Schroders  (LON:SDR), are expected to follow suit.
U.S. fund giant Vanguard Group has announced it would close its Hong Kong and Japan operations, while shifting its Asian headquarters to Shanghai. 

BlackRock has six months to establish the unit, the regulator said in its statement.

622,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 28, 2020 07:50PM ET</span>",Activist lawyer Wolosky sues Williams Cos over poison pill,"By Svea Herbst-Bayliss
BOSTON (Reuters) - Lawyer Steve Wolosky usually helps activist investors like Starboard Value take on corporate America. Now he is taking center stage himself, wading into a governance fight over a tool that limits how much stock unwanted investors can buy.
Wolosky is suing  Williams Cos  (N:WMB) five months after the energy company adopted a so-called poison pill, a takeover defense tool designed nearly 40 years ago to keep hostile bidders and activist investors at bay.
Wolosky filed the proposed class action suit in Delaware Chancery Court this week not on behalf of a client but as the plaintiff himself to force Williams to eliminate ""an extremely aggressive overreach of corporate power.""
Williams, like dozens of other companies, raced to adopt poison pills as protective measures when their stock prices cratered along with oil prices and fuel demand this year during the COVID-19 pandemic.
But Williams' pill raised eyebrows from the beginning with its unusually low 5% threshold and a ""wolfpack"" provision aimed at preventing investors from contacting other similarly minded shareholders, governance experts said.
Wolosky's suit says the pill, designed to be in place until March 20, 2021, serves no purpose now. Although Williams' stock tumbled to $9.25 in March and lost half its value in the sell-off, it recovered and closed at $21.07 on Friday. The threat, Wolosky says ""has long since evaporated and the continued existence of the Pill can only be for entrenchment purposes.""
Williams said on Friday that it stands by its decision to adopt the pill.
""During a time of unprecedented dislocation in equity market valuations, the board acted to support the rights of shareholders and maintain a fair value for their investment, protecting against those who would seek short-term gains to take advantage of market conditions at the expense of the company and its long-term investors,"" according to an email from Williams Media Relations.
Corporate governance experts said it is highly unusual for a corporate advisor like a lawyer to take this kind of action. 
""I don't know of a precedent for this, but that Steve Wolosky himself is the plaintiff only adds gravitas,"" said Chris Cernich, managing partner at Strategic Governance Advisors, which advises companies facing activists.
Poison pills are generally frowned upon in the governance arena for their dilutive effect on ownership and had been used sparingly, reserved as emergency measures. But this year's volatile markets brought them back.
Proxy advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services recommended in April that Williams shareholders not support the company's board chair because of the ""highly restrictive"" nature of the pill.
""There is great controversy around pills and they require careful analysis and crafting to make sure they are not overly restrictive,"" said Greg Taxin, managing director at Spotlight Advisors, the leading adviser to companies and investors in activist situations, according to FactSet Research Systems.

Wolosky, a partner at Olshan Frome Wolosky, is being represented by Bernstein Litowitz Berger & Grossman LLP and Friedman Oster Tejtel PLLC.

VANCOUVER (Reuters) - The company that operates the Trump International Hotel in Vancouver said on Friday it has filed for bankruptcy, blaming the coronavirus pandemic for lost revenue and financial hardship.
TA Hotel Management Ltd Partnership (TAHMLP), a unit of Malaysia-based  TA Global Bhd  (KL:TAGL), said the temporary closure since March due to COVID-19 impacted the hotel's business.
Vancouver-based developer Holborn Group, which owns the tower, licensed the Trump name for the project under a 2013 agreement. The 69-story luxury hotel in downtown Vancouver opened in 2017 amid protests against U.S. President Donald Trump. 
""Its ongoing expenses since the outbreak of COVID-19 and lack of revenue has placed TAHMLP into a position of insolvency,"" a statement on the company website said.
Documents filed in Canada on Thursday showed that TA Hotel Management Ltd Partnership owes C$4.79 million ($3.66 million) and has total assets of C$1.1 million. TA Hotel Management leased the hotel premises and operated it, according to the statement.
In 2019, the hotel's revenue dropped 4% due to a decline in food and beverage sales, according to TA Hotel Management's annual report.
TA Global Bhd and Holborn Group did not respond to requests for comment.
Grant Thornton Ltd has been appointed as the trustee. A meeting of creditors will take place on Sept. 16.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Walmart Inc (N:WMT) could turn into an online advertising leader if its plan to acquire popular short-form video app TikTok goes through, analysts said on Friday.
The proposed purchase, in partnership with  Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT), would allow the world's largest retailer to quickly compete with Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN),  Facebook Inc  (O:FB) and Alphabet Inc's Google (O:GOOGL) for eyeballs on social media, reaching customers across virtual and physical sales channels.
TikTok is up for sale as the Chinese-owned company is under fire from the Trump administration as a potential national security risk due to the vast amount of private data the app is compiling on U.S. consumers.
Walmart, which pitched its ad business to large consumer goods companies and advertising firms for the first time last year, said on Thursday it was ""confident"" it could meet U.S. TikTok users' expectations and satisfy U.S. regulators' concerns.
TikTok owner ByteDance aims to ink a deal by Sept. 15, people familiar with the matter told Reuters on Thursday.
""Walmart is going to see a very quick rise in ad spend"" if its bid succeeds, said Scott Smigler, president of e-commerce marketing agency Exclusive Concepts.
""From a brand standpoint, it's a no brainer because of the reach Walmart has and the huge shift we're seeing right now from offline to online (spending). ... For all of our brands and retailers that are eligible, we're going to want them on Walmart for sure.""
Last week, Walmart posted its biggest-ever quarterly growth in online sales, as the unprecedented spike in demand seen by big-box retailers at the peak of the coronavirus lockdowns has remained strong even as restrictions ease.
Walmart does not break out revenue from sponsored ads for products sold on its website. But online ads yield much higher margins than product sales, and ad revenue is growing as the retailer boosts investments in the area.
It has been more important than ever for Walmart to find new ways to win market share from its closest e-commerce rival Amazon.com, a fast-growing ad platform, as customers increasingly shop online.
Amazon reported $4.2 billion in advertising and other revenue for the most recent quarter, nearly double what it brought in for the same period two years prior. That amount is up 41% from the year-ago period.
Retailers including  Target  Corp (N:TGT) and grocers such as  Tesco  Plc (L:TSCO) have aggressively wooed big advertisers to their websites to drive sales through pop-up banners and search-bar keywords.
In July, Bentonville, Arkansas-based Walmart rolled out new features for its in-house advertising platform Walmart Media Group.
Walmart has seized many opportunities to scoop up online brands like Bonobos, which it purchased for $310 million in 2017, and Art.com, which it bought for an undisclosed amount in 2018.
In 2010, Walmart announced its new video-on-demand service with its acquisition of Vudu, which also offers a free ad-supported streaming option. However, Vudu still lags far behind the monthly viewership numbers that competitors Netflix (O:NFLX) and Hulu pull in, and Walmart sold it to Comcast Corp-owned (O:CMCSA) Fandango Media LLC, a movie ticketing service, in April.
Investors are viewing Walmart's play for TikTok as a potential win, and are raring to know more details.
""It's really hard to put a value on the return they're (Walmart) going to get from this"" possible acquisition, said Randy Hare, portfolio manager at Huntington Private Bank.
""But clearly the market's excited about this because this could really help Walmart with a new channel of advertising.""

(Reuters) - Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) said on Friday it had terminated ""Fortnite"" creator Epic Games' account on its App Store amid a legal battle over the iPhone maker's in-app payment guidelines and accusations they constitute a monopoly.
Apple said its move will not affect Epic Games' Unreal Engine, a software tool relied on by hundreds of other app makers. But the move means iPhone users will not be able to download ""Fortnite"" or other Epic titles through the Apple App Store. Players who have already downloaded Epic's games will still be able to play but will no longer be able to make in-app purchases with Apple's payment system.
On Monday, a federal court ruled that Apple could block Epic's titles from its store but could not take action that would harm Unreal Engine while Epic's antitrust lawsuit against the iPhone maker plays out.
Apple pulled Epic after the popular games creator implemented a feature to let iPhone users make in-app purchases directly, rather than using Apple's in-app purchase system, which charges commissions of 30%.
Apple had said it would allow ""Fortnite"" back into the store if Epic removed the direct payment feature. But Epic refused on Thursday, saying complying with Apple's request would be ""to collude with Apple to maintain their monopoly over in-app payments on iOS.""
Epic's decision all but assured its account would be terminated, the step Apple took Friday.
""The court recommended that Epic comply with the App Store guidelines while their case moves forward, guidelines they’ve followed for the past decade until they created this,"" Apple said in a statement.
""Instead they repeatedly submit Fortnite updates designed to violate the guidelines of the App Store. This is not fair to all other developers on the App Store and is putting customers in the middle of their fight.""

Investing.com – The S&P 500 and Nasdaq notched record highs Friday, as tech continued its march higher in the wake of data pointing to underlying strength in the U.S. consumer. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.57%, or 161 points, erasing its losses for the year. The S&P 500 added and Nasdaq Composite gained 0.67% and 0.60% to notch another record close. 
Signs the consumer, an important driver of growth, is not reining in spending continued to support optimism over the pace of the recovery.
Consumer spending rose by 1.9% in the month of July, according to the Commerce Department, topping economists' forecast for a 1.5% increase.
The rise in spending was slower than the prior month's 6.5% surge, raising concerns growth could slow again this month. But some on Wall Street said the spending more likely will pick-up as U.S. lawmakers are poised to eventually roll out more fiscal stimulus.
""Even if spending does contract in August, the weakness is likely to be short-lived. Another round of fiscal support - which is still our base case - should reverse the Aug cliff and cause personal income to reaccelerate sharply in the September/October timeframe,"" Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) said in a note.

629,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 28, 2020 04:20PM ET</span>",U.S. gives automakers at least six more months to meet 'quiet car' rules,"By David Shepardson
(Reuters) - U.S automakers will have another six months to meet ""quiet car"" regulations requiring electric and hybrid vehicles to emit alert sounds to warn pedestrians when they approach, a federal regulator said on Friday, citing the coronavirus pandemic.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said it was seeking public comment on whether to extend the deadline by a full year, as requested in April by a group representing major automakers, including General Motors Co (N:GM), Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p) and Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203).
The carmakers asked NHTSA to extend the Sept. 1 deadline for full compliance by another year. The agency on Friday opted to extend the date for full compliance to March 1, saying it believes the six-month delay ""strikes a reasonable balance between providing necessary regulatory relief and implementing” the requirements as quickly as possible.
The long-delayed rules, first demanded by Congress in 2010, require automakers to add sounds to vehicles when they are moving at speeds of up to 18.6 miles per hour (30 km per hour) to help prevent injuries among pedestrians, cyclists and the blind.
The National Federation of the Blind praised NHTSA's decision in a joint statement with the auto trade group Auto Innovators, which had sought the delay.
Automakers noted the earlier shutdown of North American auto production ""impacted the ability of manufacturers to fully implement the quiet car rule.""
NHTSA in September 2019 gave automakers an additional year to comply beyond the schedule proposed by the Obama administration.
Automakers are selling more electrically powered vehicles to meet emissions rules, and those are often harder to hear at lower speeds than gasoline-powered engines.
At higher speeds, tire noise, wind resistance, and other factors eliminate the need for alert sounds, regulators say.
NHTSA estimated the rules would cost the auto industry about $40 million annually because automakers will need to add an external waterproof speaker to comply; benefits of reduced injuries are estimated at $250 million to $320 million annually.

NHTSA estimates the odds of a hybrid vehicle being involved in a pedestrian crash are 19% higher than with a traditional gasoline-powered vehicle. About 125,000 pedestrians and cyclists are injured annually on U.S. roads.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street advanced on Friday, with technology stocks driving the S&P 500 to its sixth record closing high since confirming a bull market on Aug. 18.
The Nasdaq also set an all-time closing high and the blue-chip Dow is now in positive territory year-to-date.
The S&P 500 is close to wrapping up what appears to be its best August in 34 years.
All three major U.S. stock indexes ended the week higher than last Friday's close, marking the fifth consecutive weekly gains for the S&P and the Nasdaq.
""Tech stocks have driven much of the recovery this year, but we are seeing breadth expand, which is helping indices like the Dow Jones Industrial Average,"" said David Carter, chief investment officer at Lenox Wealth Advisors in New York.
Stocks extended their gains after a top aide to President Donald Trump said the president is willing to sign a $1.3 trillion coronavirus relief bill, four weeks after emergency unemployment benefits expired for millions of Americans.
Economic data released before the bell showed American consumers, who account for about 70% of the U.S. economy, increased their spending more than expected in July but the savings rate, a barometer of consumer uncertainty, remained elevated well above pre-pandemic levels.
The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) core index, which excludes food and energy, rose at a rate of 1.3% year-on-year. On Thursday, U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell unveiled a new monetary strategy adopting an average annual inflation target of 2%, implying the central bank could keep key interest rates near zero even if inflation rises above its target.
""(The Fed's) new-found acceptance of higher inflation suggests the recovery could continue for much longer, as will near-zero rates,"" Carter added.
Unofficially, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 160.77 points, or 0.56%, to 28,653.04, the S&P 500 gained 23.3 points, or 0.67%, to 3,507.85 and the Nasdaq Composite added 70.30 points, or 0.6%, to 11,695.63. Energy stocks ended the session with largest percentage gain among the major S&P sectors after Hurricane Laura passed through the Gulf region without causing widespread damage and oil rigs and refineries began to restart operations.
United Airlines and Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) Co rose as they prepared for cost-cutting efforts including furloughs and voluntary separations.
But tech companies continue to benefit from companies shifting to a work-from-home model.
Business software company Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY) Inc jumped after raising its annual subscription forecast and Dell Technologies (NYSE:DELL) Inc rose following its quarterly profit beat.
Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc announced it was joining  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its bid for TikTok's U.S. assets from Chinese owner ByteDance.

Nutanix (NASDAQ:NTNX) Inc soared after the cloud service provider beat earnings expectations and Bain Capital invested about $750 million in the company.

The Department of Defense earlier this year designated 20 top Chinese firms as Chinese military companies operating directly or indirectly in the United States, including those ""owned or controlled"" by the People's Liberation Army that provide commercial services, manufacture, produce or export.
The updated list also included China Three Gorges Corporation Limited [CYTGP.UL], Sinochem Group Co Ltd [SASADA.UL] and  China Spacesat  (SS:600118).
The Chinese Embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The Pentagon's designations do not trigger penalties, but a 1999 law that mandates compilation of the list says the president may impose sanctions that could include blocking all property of the listed parties.
The Pentagon has come under pressure from lawmakers of both U.S. political parties to publish the list, amid rising tensions between Washington and Beijing over technology, trade and foreign policy.
The list will likely add to tensions between the world's two largest economies, which have been at loggerheads over the handling of the coronavirus pandemic and China's move to impose security legislation on Hong Kong, among multiple points of friction that have worsened this year.

On Wednesday, the United States blacklisted 24 Chinese companies, including China Communications Construction Company, and targeted individuals it said were part of construction and military actions in the South China Sea, the first such U.S. sanctions move against Beijing over the disputed strategic waterway.

ByteDance is expected to pick a bidder to enter into exclusive talks as early as Friday but it's not clear how any deal would affect the future of the quirky videos that are loved by millions and those who make them. 
Claire Hesser, 18, a former beauty queen, says TikTok has quickly become a huge part of youth culture.
""I feel like if it gets taken away, I feel it's going to hurt more rather than benefit. ... I just wish that they understood that TikTok really does have an impact on our world today and our generation especially,"" she said.
It's not just the influencers that any changes could affect, but also brands seeking to do business with them.
""Maybe people shut down sales in store and they were going to do a e-commerce strategy that involved TikTok. It could affect a lot of industries - especially the music industry because so many songs go viral from TikTok,"" said Ariadna Jacob, whose company manages Kids Next Door LA.
Hailey Orona, known online as @real.ona, has 9.5 million followers on TikTok and is about to launch her own beauty line. But she also has 2.8 million followers on Instagram to fall back on.
""If it does get banned, I have a back-up plan, of course, which is to move to the YouTube platform or use the Reels on Instagram,"" Orona said.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 and Nasdaq continued to flirt with record highs Friday, led by a climb in the energy and technology sectors and data showing the U.S. consumer remains in good shape.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.80%, or 227 points. The S&P 500 added 0.68%, while the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.63%.. 
Signs the consumer, an important driver of growth, is not reining in spending continued to support optimism over the pace of the recovery.
Consumer spending rose by 1.9% in the month of July, according to the Commerce Department, topping economists' forecast for a 1.5% increase.
The rise in spending was slower than the prior month's 6.5% surge, raising concerns growth could slow again this month. But some on Wall Street said the spending more likely will pick-up as U.S. lawmakers are poised to eventually roll out more fiscal stimulus.
""Even if spending does contract in August, the weakness is likely to be short-lived. Another round of fiscal support - which is still our base case - should reverse the Aug cliff and cause personal income to reaccelerate sharply in the September/October timeframe,"" Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) said in a note.
Energy was among the biggest gainers on the day, up more than 1%. The sector shrugged off weakness in U.S. oil prices as bets on major disruptions to U.S. energy infrastructure limiting output further were reined in after Hurricane Laura passed along the U.S. Gulf Coast causing less damage than feared.
Big tech also supported the broader move higher as the Fab 5 - with the exception of Facebook - continued to trade in the green.
Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) were higher, while Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) fell 0.3%.
Tech was also helped by a 5% rally in Dell Technologies (NYSE:DELL) after the company reported better-than-expected results on both the top and bottom lines.
Elsewhere on the earnings front, Ulta Beauty (NASDAQ:ULTA) surged 6% after its second-quarter profit topped consensus estimates, underpinned by a strong e-commerce performance.
In other news,  Herbalife  Nutrition Ltd (NYSE:HLF) was flat after the company reportedly agreed to pay $123 million to settle charges alleging it bribed Chinese officials to expand its business in the country, according to media reports."
634,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 28, 2020 03:35PM ET</span>","Ackman sees more gains for his portfolio, urges stock ownership for all Americans","By Svea Herbst-Bayliss
BOSTON (Reuters) - Billionaire hedge fund manager William Ackman touted the success of his funds on Friday, citing attractive valuations for his holdings and saying he has up to $7 billion to invest in a private company, while saying that opening stock ownership to all Americans is a key to political stability.
For a second straight year, Ackman's Pershing Square Capital Management is generating double-digit returns with a 44.1% gain at his Pershing Square Holdings portfolio. Four of nine portfolio companies, including Lowe's (N:LOW) and Chipotle Mexican Grill (N:CMG) have gained in spite of the Covid-19 outbreak.
""Our current holdings remain attractively valued, offering substantial additional profit potential over the long term,"" Ackman wrote to investors, adding that even those in the red, including  Hilton Worldwide  (N:HLT), ""will recover in the long term.""
Fresh off of raising the largest-ever special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) that helps private companies go public, Ackman, one of Wall Street's best-known hedge fund managers, said his company would take a minority stake in a target company, possibly making him a more attractive investor than strategic buyers who want control.
Ackman said he is talking with potential targets and said his firm's ""idea generation engine is intact and productive.""
Investors were ready to commit as much as $12 billion to the SPAC, Tontine, Ackman wrote. ""We used the excess demand for the PSTH IPO to curate a shareholder list that would be the envy of any public company."" 
Ackman, who in March urged a shutdown to curb the spread of Covid, said broader access to the stock market is imperative. ""We need a program that makes every American an owner of the compounding growth in value of corporate America,"" he wrote, suggesting a government-funded account for every child born in America.

""Americans that have no ownership in the success of capitalism, and who are suffering economically, are more motivated to turn toward socialism or other alternatives.""

635,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 28, 2020 02:45PM ET</span>",Wall Street's 'fear gauge' climbs despite U.S. stock rally,"By April Joyner
NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks are rallying, but so too is Wall Street's ""fear gauge,"" in an unusual twist.
The Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) was set for a second week of gains, despite a drop on Friday, even as the benchmark S&P 500 (SPX) has climbed nearly 3% for the week. That is a departure from typical activity, in which the VIX falls as stocks rise.
Yet steep climbs higher can also contribute to greater volatility. The S&P 500 is on track for nearly a 7% monthly gain, exceeding the expectations priced into options, said Christopher Murphy, co-head of derivatives strategy at Susquehanna Financial Group. The steady rise in stocks has spurred purchases of upside calls on the benchmark index, which in turn are lifting the VIX.
""Just because (the S&P 500) is up doesn't mean there isn't volatility,"" Murphy said.
Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's remarks regarding the central bank's approach to inflation also likely prompted call buying, said Matt Thompson, managing partner at options firm Thompson Capital Management.
The Fed will now aim for 2% inflation on average, so that periods of too-low inflation would likely be followed by an effort to lift inflation moderately above that level. As a result, the central bank is likely to keep rates near zero, thereby supporting equities.
""That gave the green light to put bets on the upside,"" Thompson said.
Longer-term, however, downside concerns for the overall market may also keep the VIX bid up. Some investors have pointed to concerns that a narrow group of tech-related stocks such as Apple Inc (O:AAPL) and Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) is leading the S&P 500 higher, prompting concerns about any slides in their performance. Moreover, VIX futures <0#VX:> point to elevated volatility expectations around the U.S. presidential election on Nov. 3.

""If election volatility stays at that level, you could see the VIX marching higher,"" Murphy said.

636,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 28, 2020 02:25PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Sanofi more confident about its coronavirus vaccines,"By Matthias Blamont
PARIS (Reuters) -  Sanofi  (NASDAQ:SNY)'s confidence in its coronavirus vaccine candidates has increased this summer as the French drugmaker prepares to start clinical trials, its chief executive told Reuters.
The company is working on two of the more than 150 potential vaccines being developed across the world to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic, which has claimed more than 831,000 lives and sparked economic chaos.
One candidate, to be manufactured on the back of an existing platform that develops vaccines to treat flu, will use an adjuvant made by Britain's GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE:GSK) to boost its efficacy. 
The other, being developed with U.S. company Translate Bio (NASDAQ:TBIO), relies on a different technology known as mRNA.
""The early data is saying that we're on the right track and that we have a vaccine,"" Paul Hudson (NYSE:HUD) said in an interview on Friday, referring to the vaccine being developed with GSK. 
That vaccine is set to start clinical trials next month. 
Around 30 experimental coronavirus shots are already in human trials. But Hudson said in June the probability of Sanofi obtaining a vaccine with an efficacy of more than 70% was higher than for rivals, in part due to its experience in vaccines.
""Our confidence has increased. We have work to do like everybody on manufacturing in large volumes. But we will have one, maybe two vaccines next year,"" Hudson said.
Translate Bio said on Tuesday the mRNA vaccine had induced an immune response in non-human studies, with trials in humans expected to start in November. 
Sanofi has secured deals for the vaccine-plus-adjuvant with the United States and Britain, and is in advanced talks with the European Union to supply it with up to 300 million doses.
But the EU is offering only partial protection to vaccine makers against legal risks from side-effects of their potential shots, European officials said earlier this week, in a move that is hampering deals and contrasts with U.S. policy.
""I think with the level of protection, we have reached an 'agreed level'. And I think that has allowed us to go forward and sign. But I am aware there are different positions on how strong that is,"" Hudson said.
With vaccines being developed at record speed during the pandemic, there is potentially a greater risk they may have unexpected consequences or may not be effective.
The financial coverage of these liabilities is a key feature of drugmakers' talks with governments keen to secure vaccine shots in advance.

There is so far no approved coronavirus vaccine, except one authorised in Russia before large-scale trials.

639,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 28, 2020 01:10PM ET</span>",U.S. IPO market channels spirit of '99 to tee up bumper 2020,"By Joshua Franklin, Krystal Hu and Anirban Sen
(Reuters) - A host of companies have filed for U.S. initial public offerings (IPOs) this week in the busiest period in recent history, as businesses rush to take advantage of ample investor appetite for new stocks. 
Filings by the likes of data analytics company Palantir Technologies and cloud-based data warehouse firm Snowflake Inc underscore the rebound in the IPO market, which had all but ground to a halt in April due to the economic uncertainty of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
The likes of short-term home rental company Airbnb and food delivery company DoorDash are also gearing up for IPOs later this year. 
It has teed up what dealmakers expect to be one of the busiest ever ends of the year. 
""September, October is normally the busiest time of year for IPOs but I think the market is going to make history with the breadth of activity we'll have this year,"" said Jim Cooney, head of equity capital markets for the Americas at Bank of America. 
There were 17 filings of registration statements to go public this week as of Friday morning, the highest in the last five years, Refinitiv data showed. 
Action by the U.S. Federal Reserve earlier this year to pump cash into markets has driven equity markets back up to record highs despite the economic hit from the pandemic.
The rising stock market has made for a fertile IPO market, with the strong performance by new stocks also a crucial factor.
The average one-day gain for U.S. IPOs so far this year is 23.7%, compared to 12.8% in 2019 and 13.4% in 2018, according to data provider Dealogic. The average one-week return for 2020 is 25.4%, again outpacing 15.2% in 2019 and 11.9% in 2018. 
Some companies have been able to notch eye-watering gains. Retail software firm BigCommerce Holdings Inc (O:BIGC) has seen its shares rise over 300% since its public debut earlier this month. 
""There's an exuberance throughout the IPO market that has resulted in investors being rewarded for participating and issuers being rewarded for fast-forwarding their IPO timelines,"" Cooney said. 
That exuberance has also been seen in Asia where Ant Group,  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA)'s fintech arm and China's dominant mobile payments firm, this week filed for a dual listing in Hong Kong and Shanghai which could raise as much as $30 billion to become the world's largest IPO. It is a different story in Europe, where listing volumes were at their lowest in eight years in the first half of 2020.
""IT FEELS LIKE 1999""
The strong run of IPO pricings continued this week with Chinese electric vehicle maker  Xpeng Inc  (N:XPEV). The company sold shares in its $1.5 billion IPO above its target range and saw its stock jump more than 50% on its New York Stock Exchange debt.
Companies have raised more than $70 billion in U.S. IPOs so far in 2020, already outpacing a $62.5 billion haul for all of 2019. That puts the year on track to be the busiest since 2014 and second-biggest since 2000. 
Much of the IPO activity has been driven by so-called special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs), which are shell companies and raise money in an IPO to make an acquisition, typically within two years and are set for a record year.
This week, Gary Cohn, the former economic adviser to U.S. President Donald Trump, became the latest high-profile name to join the frenzy of SPAC dealmaking. 
The breakneck pace for IPOs has evoked memories of the dot-com bubble at the turn of the century, with concerns the exuberance could lead to frothy valuations which are not sustainable in the long run.
""The levels of activity that we are seeing right now are at levels that we have not seen in a very long time,"" said Tad Freese, managing partner of the Silicon Valley office of law firm Latham & Watkins. ""It feels like 1999 again.""

640,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 28, 2020 01:05PM ET</span>","Banks eye layoffs as short-term crisis ends, long-term costs emerge","By Elizabeth Dilts Marshall, Anirban Sen and Imani Moise
NEW YORK (Reuters) - At the height of the coronavirus pandemic last spring, the heads of U.S. banks including  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) and others pledged not to cut any jobs in 2020 because it was the wrong thing to do.
However, as executives prepare for an extended recession and loan losses that come with it, layoffs are back on the table, said consultants, industry insiders and compensation analysts.
Compared with April projections, bank economists and executives expect the U.S. economy to take longer to recover, with high unemployment into 2021 and interest rates staying near zero for the foreseeable future.
On top of that, working from home has shown some managers that they need fewer employees to do the same amount of work. 
""No question, layoffs (will) come across the board for all the banks,"" said Barry Schwartz, chief investment officer at Toronto-based Baskin Wealth Management, which invests in JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) and other large Canadian banks. 
Banks have to cut costs because of expected credit issues, as well as low interest rates and regulatory pressure to trim dividends, he said.
Bank staff could shrink by an average of 5-10%, mainly at mid- and lower levels in technology, human resources and finance departments, according to Alan Johnson, head of the compensation consultancy Johnson Associates, Inc.
JPMorgan Chase & Co already cut around 100 jobs in mid-July, according to comments on social media. People who said they worked in three divisions – the community and consumer bank, the commercial bank and the corporate and investment bank – said they were let go. JPMorgan representatives declined to comment.
 Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co resumed cutting jobs in August after putting layoffs on hold in March. The affected staff have so far been in technology and retail banking, and management is planning thousands more layoffs this year and next, sources said.
""We didn't see a lot of restructuring or layoffs with the banks (earlier in the pandemic). We're starting to see it now,"" said Dennis Baden, partner-in-charge at executive search firm Heidrick & Struggles.
""Things will get a little bit worse ... and we might see an increase in restructuring.""
Among global banks, Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF) PLC and HSBC Holdings (NYSE:HSBC) PLC have let go of several hundred employees this year. Standard Chartered plans to lay off a few hundred more this year and early next year, according to bank sources. 
A Standard Chartered spokesman said the job cuts are not due to the pandemic, but are part of a more than 4-year-old strategic plan. Any Standard Chartered employees let go in 2020 will be paid their salary for the rest of the year and will receive severance pay, according to a bank statement. 
HSBC announced this month it was restarting a plan to cut 35,000 jobs.
The Bank of Nova Scotia also let go of some U.S. investment bank staff, according to several sources familiar with the development. The bank declined to comment.
Reuters reported in May that large Wall Street banks were widely expected to cut budgets, including areas in technology and operations, like third-party consultants, business analytics, process management and call centers.
FROM RECORD REVENUES TO JOB CUTS
Wall Street's trading and investment banking businesses generated huge revenue from the market volatility in March and April. But CEOs and analysts have since cautioned that capital-markets revenue will trend downwards for the rest of the year, despite market indexes posting record highs recently.
Analysts still expect banks to report decent profits in coming quarters, and some may continue to invest in core businesses in an opportunistic way. For instance, JPMorgan Chase opened 13 new branches in July, after having closed 22 branches in June on a net basis, according to S&P Global.
Still, banks are planning staff cuts because costs are expected to be high relative to revenue, and management teams have found that remote work setups function better than expected, said Johnson.
""Everyone has been surprised by how much more efficient you can be,"" he said. ""Later this year or early next year, (managers will) look around and say we just have many more people than we need.""

(This story corrects paragraph 9 to say that Wells Fargo ""resumed cutting jobs in August"" after a pause in March, instead of ""outlining a three-month pause in April"".)

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell tried to address economic inequalities in his landmark policy move. Still the Fed holding rates lower-for-longer may support bulging asset prices - which is unlikely to benefit the neediest and could well widen the wealth gap in the near term.
In the fight against the economic impacts of coronavirus, the Fed has unleashed unprecedented support - zero-bound rates and asset buying that has extended to corporate bonds. The by-product of that has been a surge in equities that has taken U.S. stocks to fresh highs. 
Powell on Thursday announced a new monetary policy strategy that would allow the central bank to let inflation - which has been undershooting its target for years - run above target, signaling that policymakers won't consider raising rates until inflation overshoots for some period. Powell also gave a nod to the role of racial income disparities in holding back economic growth as the new strategy puts more weight on bolstering the labor market and less on worries about inflation.
Yet asset price spikes fueled by monetary support may even be exacerbating disparity, some say. 
""Lower-for-longer interest rates means asset prices climb with limited impact in the real economy, which could in some scenarios actually exacerbate wealth inequality instead of mitigate it,"" said Nela Richardson, investment strategist at Edward Jones in St. Louis. 
An analysis of 2016 Federal Reserve data by Edward Wolff, an economics professor at New York University, said that 84% of stocks owned by U.S. households are held by the wealthiest 10% of Americans, limiting the power of a stock market rally to turn into broad gains in household wealth.
While it may seem that rising asset prices would in general be better than falling ones, a research note from Citi in July said that ""in general there is strong evidence that market busts, though unpleasant, tend to reduce inequality"" while ""the benefits of credit and asset price booms accrue disproportionately to a small minority and hence increase it."" 
When announcing the policy shift, Powell said that it was hard to overstate the benefits that higher levels of employment would have for people ""left behind for too long"" and that the changes to the Fed's strategy reflected an appreciation for the benefits a strong labor market has for low and moderate income communities.
Still, it may take years for that strategy to pay off for workers at the lowest echelons of the job market, often women and people of color who account for a disproportionate share of low-wage jobs. But the payoff for the asset-holding class is already underway.
The new central bank policy provided a bit more fuel to stocks on Thursday, with the S&P rising 0.2% - up more than 50% from its March low. 
""It is very telling that... there was enough capital to bring the markets to where we are now on the back of monetary policy which is only part of the solution,"" said Venk Reddy, chief investment officer of corporate debt investment firm Zeo Capital Advisors. ""This tells me there are certain people benefiting greatly from this and there is a whole large part of the country that at the moment is being forgotten."" 
Investors noted the limits to what the Fed can achieve on its own and stressed the importance of fiscal policy set by the government, such as stimulus programs.
Negotiations to extend U.S. coronavirus relief have stalled, and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on Thursday that talks would not resume until the Trump administration agreed to $2.2 trillion in aid.
Rick Rieder, Blackrock (NYSE:BLK)'s global chief investment officer of fixed income, said the Fed's policies alone were ""blunt."" 
""I think the Fed is very, very aware of their policies and what they do when they make financial conditions much easier,"" said Rieder. ""But if fiscal policy doesn't follow alongside then you are going to create massive aberrations and massive inequalities.""

(Reuters) - Wall Street was swift to see the rationale behind Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc jumping into the fray to buy TikTok - access to millions of young, digitally savvy users who could help the 60-year-old company boost its online sales.
The retailer revealed plans to join  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) in a bid for the social media firm's U.S. assets on Thursday, hours after the video company's chief executive said he would step down.
Analysts said Walmart picking up a stake in the short-form video app, which is owned by China's ByteDance and claims to have about 100 million active monthly users in the United States, could be a game changer for the world's largest retailer.
""Connecting with a younger audience is vital to Walmart's long-term outlook, especially as more digitally native generations move into their prime consumption years,"" UBS analyst Michael Lasser said.
""The lines are blurring between traditional shopping, digital shopping and social media. Walmart needs more exposure to this trend."" 
Companies have been scrambling to advertise and sell on apps like TikTok and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB)'s Instagram, where shopping has surged, as people spend hours everyday scrolling through the latest viral videos from their favorite influencers.
About 23% of U.S. users reported making a purchase on Instagram earlier this year, compared to just 15% in late-2019, according to a survey conducted by RBC Capital Markets. 
A combination of Walmart's e-commerce operations and customer purchase data with Microsoft's Azure cloud platform and TikTok's mostly millennial and Gen Z monthly users could create a digital behemoth even more dominant than Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) or Facebook, Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) analyst Christopher Mandeville said.
However, any potential deal will come under intense regulatory scrutiny, with TikTok under fire from the White House as a potential national security risk.
 Oracle Corp  (NYSE:ORCL) has also bid for TikTok's U.S. operations. 
Twitter livened up with memes after Walmart announced it had teamed up with Microsoft to buy a social media app less than three-years old.

""Walmart and Microsoft buying Tiktok easily the most 'hello fellow kids' move of all time,"" Twitter user @ericzawo said.

OSLO (Reuters) - Norwegian-born billionaire John Fredriksen appointed a hedge fund manager on Friday as next head of his family's key holding company, which controls assets ranging from oil tankers and rigs to real estate, fish farming and finance.
Fredriksen, 76, said Tor Andre Svelland, 53, will become chief executive of Seatankers Group, top shareholder of world number one salmon producer Mowi (OL:MOWI), tanker firm Frontline (OL:FRO) and offshore driller  Seadrill  (OL:SDRL).
Seatankers also controls dry bulk shipper Golden Ocean (O:GOGL) and real estate firm Norwegian Property (OL:NPRO), as well as Fredriksen's significant private shipping interests and a large financial portfolio.
Svelland's job will be to help Fredriksen and his daughters, Kathrine and Cecilie, take advantage of emerging business opportunities, Seatankers said.
""His vast and long experience as a manager and trader from various commodity markets, finance and not least shipping, will fit perfectly into our group,"" Fredriksen, whose net worth was last year estimated at $13 billion by Norwegian business magazine Kapital, said in a statement.
The appointment of Svelland, who recently also joined the boards of Frontline and Golden Ocean, follows the departure from the Fredriksen group earlier this year of veteran Harald Thorstein.
Fredriksen last year told Norwegian media he may seek outside investors to take larger stakes in some of his companies and could even relinquish control of some operations.
Like Fredriksen, Svelland started his career in shipping, and now heads UK-based hedge fund Svelland Capital, focused on shipping and various commodity markets. 
He has previously worked at Trafigura [TRAFGF.UL] and Goldman Sachs (N:GS).
One of the few hedge fund players active in shipping markets, Svelland Capital posted one of its best monthly returns in March, helped by oil price turmoil and a record rally in tanker rates.

Frontline, which operates a fleet of very large crude carriers (VLCC) and other oil tankers, on Thursday reported a jump in second-quarter adjusted net profit to $206.1 million from a year-ago $4.2 million.

650,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 28, 2020 10:55AM ET</span>","Apple and Tesla are splitting their shares, but does it matter?","By John McCrank
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Shares of Apple Inc (O:AAPL) and Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) will be less costly on Monday as pre-announced stock splits take effect, in theory making them more accessible to retail investors, but as more brokers offer fractional shares, some in the market question the need.
Investors cheered the Apple and Tesla announcements, helping extend a rally in the companies' shares, which along with many other technology firms, have soared in value as the market emerged from its pandemic-induced depths in March.
That made owning a piece of these companies seem out of reach of many Main Street investors. Apple closed at over $500 a share on Thursday, while Tesla continued its meteoric rise on Thursday to above $2,200 a share.
Both Apple and Tesla said their actions, a 4-1 and 5-1 split respectively, would let more investors access their shares.
But in the past year, online brokerages like Robinhood,  Charles Schwab  Corp (N:SCHW), and Fidelity, along with several smaller shops, have begun offering slices of individual shares. 
""Fractional share ownership, all else equal, really does render the price of a stock irrelevant,"" said Julian Emanuel, chief equity and derivatives strategist at BTIG.
That, combined with commission-free trading at most brokerages, has made it easier for anyone with a mobile device to own a piece of a company.
""People my age grew up with technology and we like to invest in technology-related companies, like Tesla and Amazon (O:AMZN) and Google (O:GOOGL), and if it weren't for fractional shares we wouldn't really be able to take advantage of that,"" said Jaidan Craig, a support technician.
Craig, 23, said he has been investing for two or three years, first on Robinhood, which lets people invest as little as $1 in any listed company, and then moved to a broker called M1, which emphasizes diversifying your investments. He said that without fractional investing, he could not have built as well-rounded a portfolio.
FIRST INNING
While fractional shares have been used for years by mutual funds, they have not as been widely available for stocks until recently, and not every brokerage offers them, helping maintain the appeal of stock splits on some platforms. 
TD Ameritrade (NASDAQ:AMTD), a online trading pioneer that is being bought by rival Schwab for $26 billion, does not offer fractional shares, but said it is looking at them. 
It noted that in past years, when companies, such as Apple, Google, Mastercard Inc (N:MA) and  Visa Inc  (N:V), split their shares, retail trading volumes tripled. 
""We have historically seen that our retail investors use stock splits as trading opportunities, accessing popular names that may have gotten too expensive pre-split,"" said JJ Kinnahan, TD Ameritrade's chief market analyst.
Robinhood, which was founded in 2013 and is now valued at $11.2 billion, said that while from a psychological perspective, a stock trading in the thousands appears much more prohibitive than a stock trading in the low hundreds, perceptions are shifting.
""As fractional shares trading becomes more popular at retail brokerages, the importance and need for stock splits diminish,"" said Rebecca Moretti, a writer at Robinhood Snacks.
Just three S&P 500 (SPX) members have announced splits in 2020, compared with an average of 10 a year over the past decade, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices.
Those companies that have split their shares in the past year have, in fact, underperformed the broader S&P 500, said BTIG's Emanuel, who likened the current state of fractional investing to the beginning of a baseball game. 
""The fact that we're in the first inning of it, and yet you have seen a relative underperformance of split shares versus the S&P 500 in 2020, really points to the powerful nature of it,"" he said.

SEATTLE (Reuters) -  Boeing Co  (N:BA) is seeking to increase Black U.S. employees throughout the company by 20% and mandate benchmarks for hiring people of color, Chief Executive Dave Calhoun told employees in a memo on Friday reviewed by Reuters. 
U.S. corporations have become more responsive to complaints related to racial equality following a summer of sweeping anti-racism protests over the slaying of Black people by police.
The changes at Boeing, a stalwart defense contractor with its corporate headquarters in Chicago and largest factories in Washington state and South Carolina, appeared to mark the first concrete steps by the planemaker to address the issue.
""We understand we have work to do,"" Calhoun said in the memo, which was released on the 57th anniversary of civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr's ""I Have a Dream"" speech and included references to the police shooting of Jacob Blake in Wisconsin on Sunday.
Boeing declined to provide its current number of Black employees or a timeline for the new target.
The planemaker separately has had to lay off thousands of workers as it grapples with the financial fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic and the 17-month-old grounding of the 737 MAX after two fatal crashes.
In the memo, Calhoun said the company would establish an internal Racial Justice think-tank to guide its policies. 
On June 23, a manager at Boeing's Everett factory found ""racist symbols"" at his work station, according to an email from Commercial Airplanes Chief Executive Stan Deal to employees seen by Reuters. The manager is Black, a person familiar with the incident said.
The company launched an internal investigation and referred the matter to police, Deal said, calling the incident ""disheartening and a stark reminder of how far our society has to go."" 
Boeing was also donating some $10 million to support social justice nonprofits, such as the Equal Justice Initiative, following similar pledges from other companies such as Bank of America Corp (N:BAC) and Facebook (O:FB).

It has previously touted its strong commitment to improving diversity, though the number of women on its executive council has fallen from five to two since the beginning of 2019, according to Boeing's annual reports and website.

BENGALURU (Reuters) - Funds recommended equity holdings be trimmed to the lowest in over four years in August, despite record-breaking gains by world stocks, as the pandemic drags on and new data suggest the nascent economic rebound is stalling, Reuters polls found.
The August 17-27 poll of 35 fund managers and chief investment officers in the U.S., Europe, Britain and Japan was largely taken before Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell announced a new policy framework promoting higher inflation to spur economic recovery and job creation on Thursday.
The Fed's new strategy sent U.S. Treasury yields higher, which gave a lift to interest rate-sensitive financials and in turn boosted the S&P 500 index to a new record high and pushed the MSCI's all-country world index to surge past its pre-COVID-19 high reached in February.
While world stocks have risen as much as nearly 60% since March troughs, the poll showed average recommended exposure for equities in August in the model global portfolio was the lowest since July 2016, down to 43.1% from 43.9% the previous month.
Overall equity exposure is down 6.6 percentage points from the beginning of the year, down from 49.7% in January.
""The recent upsurge in stock markets around the world is all noise for us as a health solution is still out of reach. We are more concerned about the recovery story. The risks to the global economy remain, with tens of millions of people still out of work because of the pandemic,"" said a global chief investment officer at a large U.S. fund management company.
""The stock market in the near term may be juiced further on the Fed news. But we doubt whether the Fed would be able to lift inflation despite the new target as it hasn't been able to do so since 2012. Let's not forget, the U.S. economy is still in a deep crisis, and the risks are more to the downside as Americans prepare to vote in a contentious Nov. 3 election.""
Economic recovery was foremost in Powell's remarks made as part of the Kansas City Fed's virtual Jackson Hole symposium, in which he outlined an aggressive new strategy that aims to boost employment and allow inflation to run a bit faster for longer than in the past.
That came as new data suggest the labour market recovery is stalling, while the U.S. economy suffered its sharpest contraction in the second quarter since the government started keeping records in 1947.
The poll suggested keeping bond allocations - a key gauge of caution - for a model global portfolio at 44.3%, the highest since the survey series started in early 2010, for the third month in a row.
That defensive outlook of long-term investors does not align with the approach of over 200 equity strategists in a separate Reuters poll this week, who expect stocks to keep rising. But they did say a sombre economic outlook was likely to push stock markets to close the year below their pre-pandemic highs. [EPOLL/WRAP]
In the latest poll, fund managers with a view on when the current bull run in stocks will end were split. About 43% of respondents, or nine of 21, said it already had. Seven, or 33%, said it has over two years to run.
""This recent bull market rally has been narrow in respect to sector rotation with the economically-sensitive stocks having lagged whilst uncertainties over the second wave of COVID-19 haunts part of the market,"" said Peter Lowman, chief investment officer at Investment Quorum in London. 
""Nonetheless, central bank policy remains supportive and therefore the equity markets are likely to continue their upward trajectory but with some corrective periods along the way.""
But responses to a separate question suggested fund managers were still cautious in their approach.
Asked what is the most likely change to their portfolios, over 85% of the fund managers, or 18 of 21, said they would ""roughly maintain the current risk positioning"". Those views were broadly unchanged from the July survey.
""This crisis is already telling us that it will not be a neat and tidy economic global downturn followed by an equal and opposite neat and tidy upturn, like one might see in a traditional economic cycle,"" said Mark Robinson, chief investment officer at Bordier & Cie (UK).

""There are clearly still many uncertainties related to the virus itself and uncertainty about the scale and shape of the recovery, so some caution is still rightly warranted.""

The DJIA is at its highest level since Feb. 21, the S&P 500 is having its best week in two months, while both the S&P and the Nasdaq are on course for their fifth straight positive week.
Powell unveiled Thursday the long-awaited update on the Fed's framework, saying that the central bank will adopt an “average inflation” target that could allow inflation to run above its 2% target.
“The message was clear that the Fed will allow inflation to be above the target for some time before acting on it, i.e. a more dovish tilt to monetary policy than previously,” said analysts at Nordea, in a research note.
The Federal Reserve’s favorite inflation gauge, personal consumption expenditures excluding food and energy, is scheduled at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT).
The core PCE price index is seen posting a rise of 0.5%, with an annual rate of 1.2% for July, compared with 0.9% in the previous month - still nowhere near the key 2.0% level.

AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Investors may struggle to find new southern European government bonds for the next two years, as the European Union's support programmes could cover much of the new funding needs of countries worst hit by the pandemic.
Together with ongoing European Central Bank bond buying, the net supply of new sovereign Italian bonds to the open market may even shrink. 
Grants and loans from the recovery fund and cash from the so-called SURE jobless scheme could cover around 80% of borrowing needs after accounting for redemptions in Italy and Spain across 2021 and 2022 and 70% in Portugal,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) reckons.
""This is effectively about providing levels of financing to these countries that they will not need to go out and do themselves in the primary market,"" said Tony Small, the bank's head of European rates strategy. 
Graphic: Increase in debt ratios vs. debt relief from EU grants https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/xegpbadwwvq/debt%20ratio.png 
A source at Spain's economy ministry told Reuters SURE funds will start to affect its borrowing plans from this year and that it expects a ""sizeable"" impact on the amount of debt it will sell given the amount of funding available.
While the EU funds could directly replace some issuance, the ECB's conventional and pandemic bond purchases would absorb more than the remaining new funding needs. 
That could cut net supply of Italian government bonds to a negative 60 billion euros in 2021, Morgan Stanley estimates. The premium Italy pays for 10-year debt over Germany could fall some 35 basis points to 115 bps by the end of this year, the bank estimates, with ECB purchases already expected to create net negative issuance from this year.
What's more, many economists expect the ECB eventually to extend its pandemic purchases.. Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) expects a 300 billion-euro extension in the second half of 2021, which could take net supply of BTPs to around negative 130 billion euros next year, head of rates and credit research Christoph Rieger said, implying a much bigger ECB squeeze.
DEBT MOUNTAIN LOOMS
And yet, despite the level of support available, Italy and Spain's hefty debt will remain much higher than it was before the coronavirus for years to come. Some longer-term investors caution against overstating the size of the direct transfers relative to the scale of the debt building. 
""The grant part is material for Italy ... however, it's not a game changer,"" said Arnaud-Guilhem Lamy, a portfolio manager at BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY) Asset Management, which manages 428 billion euros.
In Italy, grants will relieve the ratio of debt to gross domestic product by around 6 percentage points, according to Commerzbank. 
But the extent of the damage Italy's economy is suffering from the crisis - with GDP expected to contract 9.5% this year- means the debt ratio is expected to remain high, at 154% of GDP, by 2021 even as the economy starts to recover, still 19 percentage points higher than in 2019.

More importantly, EU funds will help debt sustainability by allowing the country to borrow at a much cheaper cost in the long run, BNP's Lamy said. 
Italy currently pays around 1.10% for 10-year debt, while a comparable EU bond currently yields around -0.05% , so EU loans, even though they will be paid back, imply a significant cut to borrowing costs.
Lamy added to his overweight position in Italy after the fund was approved, encouraged by the EU's unprecedented show of solidarity, which bodes well for debt sustainability. 
That appears to be the consensus view, with Italian 10-year bonds outperforming Portugal and Greece since the agreement, who are set for much more meaningful debt relief. 

""The bar to resort to EU debt if problems come up has been lowered, and this is more important than the actual funding relief,"" Commerzbank's Rieger said.

662,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 28, 2020 05:55AM ET</span>","UK lawmakers, union call for extra state help for aviation sector","LONDON (Reuters) - More than 100 British lawmakers have joined forces with trade union Unite to urge the government to provide extra state support to airlines and airports as travel slumps due to the coronavirus pandemic and job losses increase. 
With travel still subdued, the lawmakers signed a letter asking for the government's job retention scheme, which pays employees a proportion of their salary while they temporarily do not work, to be extended to next March for the aviation sector.
The scheme is set to close for all businesses by the end of October. 
Airlines including British Airways (L:ICAG) easyJet (L:EZJ) and Virgin Atlantic have already announced almost 20,000 job cuts between them and Unite said 60,000 jobs in the aviation sector were ""hanging in the balance"". 
Extending the job retention scheme could prevent more job losses, said a statement from Unite on Friday. 
""This would make all the difference in ensuring our aviation industry recovers, which is of invaluable importance to the UK economy,"" said the letter signed by lawmakers and addressed to finance minister Rishi Sunak.
""It would also ensure that the skills and the infrastructure that the industry requires to return to capacity are retained."" 
Britain's quarantine rules on countries with higher infection rates such as Spain and France have dealt a new blow to aviation, deterring travel and quashing hopes of a recovery after planes were grounded during lockdowns earlier this year. 
As well as airports and airlines, there are tens of thousands of related jobs in the aviation supply chain, the letter said, adding that companies faced high levels of uncertainty over the coming winter, always a tougher period for aviation due to the industry's seasonal nature.

Unite said it also wanted the government to help the industry by suspending air passenger duty, a tax on flying, plus provide business rate relief for airports in England, and give aviation companies more time to repay loans.

663,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 28, 2020 05:36AM ET</span>",StockBeat: Norwegian Air Skids off the Runway,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- The dream is very nearly over and history is set to repeat itself. 
Norwegian Air Shuttle  (OL:NORR) stock plunged another 7.3% to a new all-time low on Friday after warning that the bailout from investors and government that it received in the spring may not be enough to stop it going bankrupt.
""Although the company believes there are reasonable prospects to resolve potential defaults and obtain necessary working capital, there is a significant risk that the company becomes insolvent and enters into bankruptcy if, inter alia, the company is not able to reach an agreement with its creditors, access to working capital and regain normalised operations,” Norwegian said on Friday as it presented its second-quarter results.
The airline has been unable to recover from the grounding of its planes for most of the second quarter, when its passenger numbers fell by 99%. All it could fly in the three months through June were a handful of domestic routes in Norway. Despite mothballing over 100 aircraft and laying off or furloughing 8,000 workers, the company still made a loss of 5.3 billion Norwegian krone ($602 million) in the quarter.
Efforts to resume services in the third quarter ran almost immediately into problems when governments - including Norway's - were quickly forced into reimposing restrictions on travelers to Europe's sun belt. That ended hopes that the airline could stabilize cash flow in its current state.
As such, the company looks a near-certainty to join Freddie Laker's Skytrain in the graveyard of those who tried and failed to make budget travel across the Atlantic a reality.
Norwegian's problems, of course, began long before Covid-19. It borrowed heavily to buy a suite of new fuel-efficient jets that it hoped would change the economics of transatlantic routes, allowing it to do for long-haul what the likes of Ryanair and EasyJet had done for short-haul. But established competitors fought back with discount lines of their own - and then disaster struck when the Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX, the plane at the heart of its strategy, was grounded after two fatal crashes. 
The company's share price had already fallen by three quarters as a result of that when the Covid-19 pandemic exploded, bringing lockdowns that choked off the revenue streams it needed to service its debt. While a huge debt-for-equity swap by its bondholders addressed some of the balance sheet issues and unlocked a sizeable loan guarantee from the Norwegian government, nothing has been able to fix the cash flow problem.
""We are thankful for the loan guarantee made available to us by the Norwegian government which we worked hard to obtain. However, given the current market conditions it is not enough to get through this prolonged crisis,” chief executive Jacob Schram said.
Norwegian's backers and management have every right to feel aggrieved. The likes of Deutsche Lufthansa  (DE:LHAG) and Air France KLM (PA:AIRF) have had multi-billion injections of equity from their home governments in a flurry of interventionism that makes Michel Barnier's current lectures to the U.K. government about a 'level playing field' after Brexit a truly LOL moment in the history of international trade. 
However, it is also true that Norwegian's founders and lenders went into this with their eyes wide open, under no illusion that aviation is  - and always has been - a business at constant risk of government intervention that damns it to endless overcapacity and low profitability. While the Norwegian government has an obligation to the people whose livelihoods it has wrecked with its public health measures, the investors must - unfortunately - lose their shirts.

(Reuters) - European stocks slipped on Friday as investors dumped this year's outperformers including technology and healthcare stocks and bid up banking shares after the U.S. Federal Reserve unveiled its new policy framework.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index (STOXX) slipped 0.1%. Technology stocks (SX8P), which have surged about 11% this year, were down 0.7%, and the healthcare index (SXDP) fell as much.
Interest rate-sensitive banks (SX7P), which have lagged the broader markets, jumped nearly 3% as yield on U.S. and European government bonds, a benchmark for borrowing costs, rose. [GVD/EUR]
Shares in  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP), HSBC (L:HSBA) and  Banco Santander  (MC:SAN) rose between 1.3% and 3%, providing the biggest boost to the STOXX 600.
Fed Chairman Jerome Powell announced a new policy framework on Thursday, which focuses more on boosting U.S. economic growth and less on worries that inflation could be running too high.
""If the Fed's policies succeed in reflating the economy, interest rates are unlikely to fall much further and value stocks such as financials should begin to outperform growth stocks, like tech, which face a growing litany of risks,"" analysts at BCA Research wrote in a note.
Further adding to the gloom, data showed German consumer morale worsened heading into September, casting some doubt on whether household spending in Europe's largest economy is powerful enough to spur a recovery.
With coronavirus cases picking up again in Europe, investors fear it could impede an economic rebound from a crash in the second-quarter, although optimism around the development of a COVID-19 treatment has helped ease those worries.
""We think an interrupted V-shaped recovery seems to be the way we're heading,"" said Francis Ellison, client portfolio manager of European equities at Columbia Threadneedle Investments. ""That means that we're seeing a sharp recovery but nowhere back to 2019 levels and that will take a year or two to reach."" 
Norwegian Air (OL:NORR) fell 5.7% after the budget carrier said it still needs more cash in order to weather the COVID-19 pandemic as it reported a deep loss for the first half of 2020.

Italian state-owned bank Monte Dei Paschi di Siena (MI:BMPS) gained 4.3% as it received a conditional green light from the European Central Bank for its bad loan clean-up plan.

TOKYO (Reuters) - SoftBank Group Corp (T:9984) said on Friday it planned to slash its exposure to wireless carrier SoftBank Corp (T:9434) in a share sale worth 1.47 trillion yen ($13.8 billion) at Friday's close, marking an expansion of the conglomerate's asset sales.
The sale will see SoftBank's stake fall to 40.4% from 62.1%. The offer price for the 1.03 billion shares, including an over-allotment, will be set Sept. 14-16.
SoftBank Group Chief Executive Masayoshi Son has been selling down the group's core assets to stabilise its balance sheet and fund a record share buyback amid the coronavirus outbreak.
The announcement marks the expansion of stake sales beyond the 4.5 trillion yen asset sale plan announced in March. One-off gains from the sales boosted the group's earnings in the April-June quarter.
""In light of the ongoing uncertainty in the market environment due to concerns about a potential second or even third wave of COVID-19, (SoftBank Group) believes it is necessary to expand cash reserves,"" the group said in a statement.
Japan's third-biggest wireless carrier will remain a group subsidiary, SoftBank said, fitting a pattern of the conglomerate exerting influence over listed investments without holding majority stakes.
SoftBank said it will hold the remaining shares ""for the medium to long term"". Son built up the wireless carrier but in recent years has refocused on tech investing.
Separately on Friday, SoftBank Corp said it will spend up to 100 billion yen buying back its shares, which have languished even as its parent's share price has leapt around 140% since March.

SoftBank Corp's shares closed down 1.6% at 1,431 yen on Friday ahead of the announcement.

Investing.com - European stock markets drifted lower Friday, selling into early gains as disappointing economic data overturned the optimism generated by the announcement of the U.S. Federal Reserve’s new monetary policy framework.
At 3:40 AM ET (0740 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 1% lower, the CAC 40 in France fell 0.7% and the U.K.'s FTSE index was down 0.6%.
German consumer morale worsened heading into September, with the GfK consumer sentiment index falling to -1.8 from an upwardly revised -0.2 in August.
The drop followed three consecutive increases from June to August, and casts doubt about the strength of the recovery in Europe’s largest economy, particularly with coronavirus cases seemingly on the rise again.
Additionally, French consumer spending rose just 0.5% in July from June, slowing from a surge of 10.3% in June, and short of economists' average forecast for an increase of 2.0%.
These numbers overshadowed the Federal Reserve’s new stance to achieve inflation averaging 2% over time, offsetting below-2% periods with higher inflation ""for some time,"" and to ensure employment doesn't fall short of its maximum level.
“Their new language gives them the flexibility to let the economy run a little hotter before contemplating raising interest rates and gives the green light to more modest yield curve steepening and dollar weakness,” analysts at ING said, in a research note.
The need for an accommodative policy was illustrated by Thursday’s weekly claims data which showed some 27 million Americans are still receiving some kind of government unemployment assistance.
In corporate news, Norwegian Air Shuttle (OL:NORR) stock slumped 10% after it warned that there is ""significant"" doubt over its ability to continue as a going concern if it can't meet its financial obligations next year.
Daimler (OTC:DDAIF) dropped 0.5%, outperforming the wider DAX index, after announcing Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) had ordered 1,800 electric vans from its Mercedes-Benz unit for its European delivery fleet.
Oil prices were a little lower Friday, with Hurricane Laura blowing through Louisiana and Texas, the heart of the U.S. oil industry, without causing major damage to refineries.
“Limited refinery damage and the quick resumption of capacity is good news for crude oil demand, although for now that is not reflected in the market,” said analysts at ING, in a research note.

669,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 28, 2020 03:25AM ET</span>",Top Philippine diplomat recommends scrapping deals with blacklisted China firms,"By Karen Lema and Neil Jerome Morales
MANILA (Reuters) - The Philippines' foreign minister said on Friday he would recommend the government terminates deals with Chinese firms blacklisted by the United States for their roles in constructing and militarising artificial South China Sea islands.
The United States on Wednesday named 24 Chinese companies and targeted individuals it said were involved in such activities, in its first sanctions move against Beijing over the disputed waterway.
""If they were in any way involved in the reclamation, then it becomes consistent on our part to terminate any contract with them,"" Foreign Secretary Teodoro Locsin told CNN Philippines, without identifying a company or project.
Among those blacklisted was China Communications Construction Co (CCCC) (SS:601800), a transport and infrastructure conglomerate, which last year got the go-ahead to build a $10 billion airport project with a local partner in Cavite, near Manila.
CCCC's subsidiary, China Harbour Engineering Company, along with a unit of Udenna Corp, a conglommorate run by Dennis Uy, a local tycoon with close ties with Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, has initial approval for a $1.2 billion reclamation project in Manila Bay.
Cavite governor Juanito Victor Remulla said he would take his cue from Duterte on how to proceed. 
""If the president says, if the Department of National Defense says that it's a security risk to enter an agreement with them, then we will terminate the agreement immediately,"" Remulla told news channel ANC.
Udenna Land, Chinese Harbour's partner in the reclamation project, and Pasay City, which is responsible for Manila Bay reclamation, did not respond to requests for comment. 
However, when asked in December if Udenna was concerned about partnering with a company involved in Mischief Reef - a manmade island on which China has installed missiles capable of hitting the Philippines - a representative of Udenna said Uy ""is not concerned"". 
In the December response to emailed questions from Reuters, Leo Venezuela, Udenna's Investor Relations Head, added the company has ""a very insignificant stake"" in the project.

The Philippines won an international arbitration case in 2016 that confirmed Mischief Reef had been built in Manila's 200-mile exclusive economic zone.

A person familiar with the matter said Abe, the nation's longest serving premier, had decided to step down.
Public broadcaster NHK earlier said Abe, who has battled the disease ulcerative colitis for years, wanted to avoid causing problems for the government due to the worsening of his condition.
Abe was scheduled to hold a news conference at 5:00 p.m. (0800 GMT).
Following are analysts' comments on Abe's resignation:
IZURU MAKIHARA, PROFESSOR OF JAPANESE POLITICS AND PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION, UNIVERSITY OF TOKYO
""It's problematic that Abe is quitting when his administration is struggling with handling the novel coronavirus pandemic.
""Given Japan is in the midst of a global pandemic, it's unlikely that whoever succeeds Abe can start putting out major policy changes. No one is expecting that from the next prime minister."" 
JIE LIU, PROFESSOR OF GRADUATE SCHOOL OF ASIA-PACIFIC STUDIES, WASEDA UNIVERSITY
""This is a surprise...We can expect a period of uncertainty now until the successor is determined. There may be a reconsideration of the state of diplomacy amid the coronavirus and deteriorating relations between the U.S. and China."" 
JEFF KINGSTON, DIRECTOR FOR ASIAN STUDIES, TEMPLE UNIVERSITY JAPAN
""It is hard to see much of a silver lining (of Abe's term as PM) but he did provide stability and managed (U.S. President Donald) Trump, which other world leaders have found has not been easy. He did stand up for free trade with his EU deal and rescued TPP, but those stand out as small accomplishments given his bold promises that 'Japan is Back'.""
LEE YOUNG-CHAE, PROFESSOR AT KEISEN UNIVERSITY IN TOKYO, JAPAN-KOREA RELATIONS EXPERT 
""In terms of Korea-Japan relations, if (Chief Cabinet Secretary) Suga succeeds, little will change compared to Abe's stance, but if (former foreign minister Fumio) Kishida takes over, then maybe there can be an improvement in relations.""
JESPER KOLL, SENIOR ADVISER TO ASSET MANAGER WISDOM TREE INVESTMENTS INC
Commenting on possible successors: ""The broad picture remains intact. In terms of economic and fiscal policy, the focus remains very much on reflation."" 
TOMOAKI IWAI, POLITICAL SCIENCE PROFESSOR AT NIHON UNIVERSITY 
""The big question here is how they decide his successor. If it's an extraordinary vote (only MPs), chances are that they'll vote for continuation of the current policies and so it'd favor Suga. If it's a full-out election with all the party members that'd favour Shigeru Ishiba.
SHINGO IDE, CHIEF EQUITY STRATEGIST, NLI RESEARCH
""The stock market has rebounded a bit for now but I think we need to be cautious, going into next week. Whoever succeeds him, it will be tough to garner strong support and political uncertainties will likely weigh on markets."" 
ROB CARNELL, ASIA-PACIFIC HEAD OF RESEARCH, ING 
""Japan needs to spend a lot of money right now, it needs to forget about debt. It could also do with perhaps reinvigorating the BOJ a bit, it's more of the same from them all the time. So there's stuff to be done. I think he should have stuck around.
""It's usually a thing with markets, better the devil you know.... without knowing who's going to step in and whether they're actually going to breathe a bit of new life into this or not, I guess markets are going to be a little unsettled by the unknown.""
SHANE OLIVER, HEAD OF INVESTMENT STRATEGY, AMP (OTC:AMLTF) CAPITAL, SYDNEY 
""I don’t see a big change on the economic policy front. There is no real alternative to Abenomics (basically ultra easy fiscal and monetary policy) whoever takes over and Kuroda will remain at the BoJ so there will be no change to ultra-easy monetary policy. There will be a bit of short term market nervousness, though but I think that will soon pass.""
KHIEM DO, HEAD OF GREATER CHINA INVESTMENTS, GLOBAL MARKETS, BARINGS, HONG KONG
""I don’t think this will be that significant. Globally the economy is not that strong, and any prime minister, any leader in Japan would try to continue to be as expansionary fiscally as possible.
""The correction in Japanese stocks could be quite a good buying opportunity. I don’t know exactly where the selling is coming from, but one would’ve thought that’d be more retail and trading oriented money on the uncertainty this may cause.
""Japan is one of the slowest economies to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic. Japan would have to do more than others. Any weakness in the Nikkei or Topix would be good buying opportunities.""
PAUL SANDHU, HEAD - MULTI-ASSET QUANT SOLUTIONS, ASIA-PACIFIC AT BNP PARIBAS ASSET MANAGEMENT, HONG KONG
""The reaction right now is temporary. It's a bit of pull back but we'll get back on track.
""Abe built his administration around reviving the Japanese economy through policy spending and monetary easing... It is still unknown when Abe will actually leave office but we can be sure that his primary focus will be to end his term by helping to reverse the economic impact of this virus and get Japan back to a point where it can put on the 2021 Olympics.""
TAKESHI MINAMI, CHIEF ECONOMIST, NORINCHUKIN RESEARCH INSTITUTE 
""It's regrettable for him because it means he had to resign over the same issue twice.... The focus at the moment will be on the coronavirus recovery and controlling the infection, regardless of who will be the prime minister.
""There has been talk that Abenomics has been having a harmful impact so I think the focal point will be on suggestions how to make changes to it.
""Of course, Abenomics stood for a weak yen and high stocks so it is unavoidable that markets are showing a response in the opposite direction.
""It'll be important what kind of vision the person who'll be the next prime minister will stand for. The market's direction will likely depend on whether the Abenomics line is followed or corrected.""
JUNICHI ISHIKAWA, SENIOR FOREIGN EXCHANGE STRATEGIST AT IG SECURITIES IN TOKYO
""This is a negative for Japanese stocks because it raises questions about what policies come next. We do see the familiar pattern of falling stocks pushing up the yen, but the important point is U.S. stock futures remain in positive territory, showing sentiment is holding up.""
MOH SIONG SIM, CURRENCY ANALYST, BANK OF SINGAPORE:
""There's been speculation all week about Abe resigning. There's some nervousness and concerns because he's the longest serving prime minister and, with him gone, there could be some uncertainty. Perhaps 'Abenomics' is coming to a close. And perhaps we could see some repatriation and this is why the yen has strengthened somewhat.
""I'm not convinced it would have a lasting impact on the yen itself, because if the news is true, whoever the successor is likely to come from the LDP and is likely to be a close ally and therefore policy continuity would still be there.""
DAISUKE KARAKAMA, CHIEF MARKET ECONOMIST AT MIZUHO BANK

""The currency market is stable right now. But for the past month, I have received inquiries from overseas about what would happen if Abe (resigns). These inquiries, they were mostly about worries over the impact on stocks market. What changed the most with the Abe administration was the stock market, with foreign investors buying Japanese stocks. If the Nikkei share average continues to be disturbed, just like it is happening right now, this would mean the yen could strengthen.""

672,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 28, 2020 02:25AM ET</span>","In wake of shootings, retailers respond to consumer interest in Black-owned businesses","By Victoria Waldersee and Melissa Fares
LISBON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - A day after the shooting of Jacob Blake in Kenosha, Wisconsin, searches for the term ""Black-owned businesses"" began to surge on Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Trends, as social media users called out for suggestions on where to spend their money in a way that supported the Black community. 
""I'd like to start a thread of Black-owned businesses to support in the Kenosha/Racine, Wisconsin area. Please add any more that you know of!"" tweeted Nikki Francois in Wisconsin. ""Mention some Black-owned businesses, I wanna support,"" Briana Howington tweeted the same day. 
The trend mirrors a peak in searches for the term ""Black-owned businesses"" on the Google search engine as well as spiking sales at Black-owned businesses in the U.S. and UK in the wake of George Floyd's death in May, as consumers sought to support the Black community. 
Some retailers have responded to the trend. Companies from health and beauty outlet Boots to luxury goods website Farfetch (NYSE:FTCH) and independent business platform Etsy (NASDAQ:ETSY) have struck deals with Black-owned businesses. 
 Target  (NYSE:TGT) in an Aug. 17 memo pledged to ""source and design significantly more products from Black creators, designers, vendors, agencies, contractors, and suppliers."" Last month, Target made it easier for shoppers to identify which products on its web site are Black-owned or Black-founded with a badge. 
""NO ONE WAS EXPECTING IT"" 
Around a month after Floyd's death, campaigners in the U.S. and UK organized dedicated days encouraging consumers to spend at Black-owned businesses and share their purchases on social media. 
Black Pound Day in the UK, now a recurring monthly event, generated over £80,000 ($100,000) in its first two iterations on June 27 and Aug. 1, according to receipts uploaded to the campaign's website. 
""No one was expecting it. Everyone was running out of stock,"" said Khalia Ismain, owner of Jamii, an online marketplace that offers products from nearly 200 Black-owned businesses in the UK. 
Businesses listed on Jamii saw record profits around Black Pound Day. An analysis by Jamii of 10 businesses that volunteered their data showed a 369% increase in revenue in June. Clickthrough rates and website hits remained above May levels into August, Ismain said. 
Six other business owners in industries from fashion to food as well as heads of Black business directories representing over 2,000 Black-owned businesses in the UK told Reuters that sales multiplied two- to four-fold in June and have settled at a level higher than before the 2020 Black Lives Matter protests. 
INFLUX OF OFFERS 
Many businesses report a continuous influx of offers from retailers to stock their brands and support young Black business founders and professionals. 
Retailers from Boots to Farfetch and Etsy have struck deals with Black-owned businesses to stock or list their products. 
A member of Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s ""Influencer Program,"" which allows users to curate product recommendations for their followers, set up a page allowing shoppers to filter for products from Black-owned businesses. The listing includes scented candles, lipstick and leave-in hair conditioner. 
Farfetch added a ""Black designers"" filter to its ""Shop by"" dropdown menu in early July, which is now outperforming other filters, a spokeswoman said. 
Independent retailer platform Etsy said its ""Black-owned shops"" vertical set up in the wake of the protests was one of its top-performing pages in the most recent quarter ending June 30. Wolf & Badger, another marketplace for independent brands, is considering implementing a similar feature after receiving regular customer emails inquiring which businesses on its website were Black-owned. 
Black-owned clothing line AAKS, which was listed by Elle, Refinery29 and others as a Black-owned business to support after Black Lives Matter, saw sales triple within a month. It has since been approached by six larger retailers across Europe, the UK and the U.S. keen to stock its products, founder Akosua Afriyie-Kumi said. 
Part of the surge has come from Black consumers seeking to support their own community, but some also have seen interest from non-Black consumers for the first time.

""I had white women getting in touch with me saying they'd been following me for ages but just didn't have the courage to buy my stuff,"" said Nana Evans, the London-based owner of clothing line Love YaaYaa. ""Now, they're not just wearing it, they're posting pictures of themselves in a headwrap on Instagram.""

673,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 28, 2020 02:20AM ET</span>",New reckoning for WHO vaccine plan as governments go it alone,"By Kate Kelland, Francesco Guarascio and Stephanie Nebehay
LONDON/BRUSSELS/GENEVA (Reuters) - The World Health Organization will next week receive a raft of pledges of support for its plan for COVID-19 vaccines for all.
But the agency has already had to scale back its ambition. 
The United States, Japan, Britain and the European Union have struck their own deals to secure millions of COVID-19 vaccine doses for their citizens, ignoring the U.N. body’s warnings that ""vaccine nationalism"" will squeeze supplies.
If other countries that can afford it pursue a similar approach, the WHO's strategy for fighting the coronavirus pandemic globally and equitably risks coming undone, experts warn.
""If that were to happen, it's fairly clear that there would be insufficient volumes of vaccine available for any other countries, particularly in the first six to nine months,"" said Alex Harris, head of global policy at the Wellcome Trust health charity. 
Countries wishing to be part of the WHO initiative, dubbed COVAX, must submit expressions of interest by Monday.
More than 170 countries, including Canada, Norway, South Korea and Britain, have submitted non-binding expressions of interest to participate in the scheme, which the WHO has touted as the only global initiative to ensure COVID-19 vaccines are available worldwide to rich and poor countries alike.
It has signed up nine COVID-19 vaccine candidates and set out plans to obtain and deliver 2 billion doses by the end of 2021 across countries that sign up. 
But it has struggled to get wealthier countries on board in full beyond pledges of funding and warm words about donating surplus vaccines. 
Last week, WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus criticised nations that hoard vaccines, warning the strategy will worsen the pandemic. In a last-ditch call for support ahead of Monday's deadline, he wrote letters to members urging their participation.
The EU Commission is ""fully committed"" to the success of COVAX while it enters into parallel talks with vaccine manufacturers for supplies for the bloc, a spokeswoman told Reuters. 
Britain said it was supporting COVAX to ensure equal access to vaccines, including funding, while doing its own bilateral supply deals.
White House did not immediately comment on the situation. The United States did not participate in the launch of the programme in April or a fundraising event in May.
DEALMAKING
The EU's aggressive dealmaking for vaccine supplies and tepid statements about COVAX have in particular undermined the initiative, which is co-led by the WHO, the GAVI vaccines alliance and the CEPI Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations.
The European Commission is likely to pledge cash for COVAX but it is also securing its own supply deals for member states, deeming COVAX too slow and expensive.
Brussels has told countries they can help fund COVAX, but can't seek to buy vaccines via both schemes, a Commission spokesman said. Forced to choose, some countries have pulled out of COVAX entirely.
The Czech Republic and Portugal were listed as early backers, but government support appears to have cooled after joining the EU vaccine procurement programme.
Prague has opted for the EU programme instead.
Portugal has asked for an initial delivery of 6.9 million doses of vaccine when the EU programme becomes available, the government has said.
Asked if it would take part in COVAX, a spokesman for the country's drug regulator INFARMED said it would coordinate its participation in the programme with other European nations.
Other WHO members, which are already major donors to existing global vaccine programmes unrelated to COVID-19, are still on the fence too.
Brazil, with the world's second worst coronavirus outbreak outside the United States, has not yet decided whether to participate, a health ministry spokeswoman said. 
In Japan, deputy Health Minister Hisashi Inatsu said he would like to enter discussions about participating, but the government has not said if it will submit an official expression of interest by Monday.
Like many wealthy nations, Japan has ordered its own supply of shots, with almost 250 millions of doses of potential vaccines booked from AstraZeneca (L:AZN),  Pfizer  (N:PFE) and BioNTech (O:BNTX).
RADICAL DEPARTURE
Officials say both COVAX and government deals can run in parallel, but that's a radical departure from the original plan outlined in the spring.
In acting alone, countries will create ""a few winners and many losers"", Richard Hatchett, CEO of CEPI, warned on Monday.
It also means poorer or less powerful countries may go to the back of the queue for vaccines that could help them control the pandemic.
""The risk is that access to COVID-19 vaccines will be defined by purchasing power and the ability to sign advance purchase deals rather than the medical needs or the shifting epidemiological situations,"" said Dimitri Eynikel, EU representative on medicines and vaccines for Doctors Without Borders.
The initiative is all the more significant for the WHO as scrutiny grows on its handling of the pandemic. The results of the first round will highlight the challenge of tackling a global crisis with competing individual interests.

One senior European government official explained the dilemma facing wealthy nations: how to support a vaccine for developing countries when there may not be enough for your own population. Diverting resources abroad ""is difficult to sell at home"", he said.

The country's seven major automakers, including Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203) and Nissan (OTC:NSANY) Motor Co (T:7201), sold a combined 2.01 million vehicles last month, according to Reuters calculations based on sales data released by the companies on Friday. 
The decline in monthly sales has slowed significantly since a 50% drop posted in April, and compared with a 21.3% fall in June. Sales in China increased on the year for most automakers, while Toyota, the country's biggest automaker, also saw growth in Europe.
Total global production at Japan's seven major automakers fell 14.4% year-on-year to 1.99 million units last month, improving from a 26.1% tumble in June. 
Global demand for cars has been weak since March due to virus-related stay-at-home orders in many countries, which led to a drop in visits to car dealerships and potential customers also reconsidered big purchases.

Many countries have been easing the lockdown restrictions, but industry experts anticipate that it could take up to five years for demand to recover to 2019 levels.

675,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 28, 2020 02:15AM ET</span>",Distressed funds eye European companies as virus support schemes ease,"By Abhinav Ramnarayan, Clara Denina and Chibuike Oguh
LONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Funds which buy debt companies are no longer able to repay are getting ready to deploy their large cash piles in Europe, betting the easing of widespread government economic support schemes will lead to a pick-up in corporate restructurings.
Central bank bond buying along with fiscal support and markets receptive to capital hikes has meant the number of large companies forced to restructure their debt has been relatively low this year despite the economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic. 
Swissport last week became the first high-profile distressed investment in Europe since the virus took hold, with a consortium of funds led by Apollo Global Management (N:APO) moving in. 
The deal is likely to be the first in a string of major restructurings in Europe slated for this autumn, lawyers and distressed investors said. 
""We expect a pick up in distressed trades as companies that need to restructure come to the market,"" said Eric Larsson, a portfolio manager for special situations funds at Alcentra, part of BNY Mellon (NYSE:BK). ""Half-a-dozen high profile high-yield and leverage loan deals (are likely) to emerge,"" he added. 
It's not just companies in the travel, aviation and retail sectors which are expected to need funds to help them through a painful period of low growth. Oil and gas companies - including Britain's  Premier Oil  (L:PMO) which recently announced a $530 million debt restructuring - are also struggling with debt.
Dutch retailer Hema is set to be taken over by its bondholders through a debt-for-equity swap https://www.reuters.com/article/dutch-retailer-hema-to-be-taken-over-by-idUSL8N2E82V0, while Spanish paper producer Lecta Group, already in the hands of bondholders, is still working on a recapitalisation, banking sources said. 
For an overview of companies seeking restructuring, click here.
THE CHALLENGE 
Distressed funds have been raising capital in recent years in anticipation of an economic downturn at the end of a long economic cycle. So-called ""dry powder"" at these funds stood at a record $84.9 billion globally in August, data from Preqin shows. 
As the pandemic triggered the downturn, many distressed investors stepped up their fund-raising efforts. Preqin shows $9.6 billion raised in the second quarter, the highest in two years.

In the U.S., several big name brands, including storied U.S. retailers such as J.C. Penny, Neiman Marcus, Brook Brothers, and Lord & Taylor, began restrucuting relatively soon after the crisis erupted. 
But economic uncertainty combined with widespread government and central bank support - particularly for corporate bond markets - has meant fewer than anticipated opportunies for distressed investors, leaving much of their capital yet to be deployed. 
""Everyone expected the end of the economic cycle. No one expected COVID-19,"" said Joseph Swanson, co-head of EMEA restructuring for Houlihan Lokey (NYSE:HLI). 
""The brutal aggression of COVID has represented the perfect storm: a combination of 9/11, SARS and the great financial crisis of 2008. It's very difficult to know how to invest,"" he added. 
The challenge for distressed investors is to pick out the companies that can be restored to good health after the crisis. 
""If you're sitting on capital it's an almost impossible dilemma how to deploy that money with entire sectors such as aviation and leisure in financial distress,"" said Paul Bagon, a restructuring and insolvency partner at law firm RPC (NYSE:RES). 

With the Swissport deal done, a raft of other companies are lining up to raise cash in the private markets; how distressed funds respond could determine their existence.

676,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 28, 2020 02:15AM ET</span>",Column: Who's loaded up on stocks? Fewer than you may think - Mike Dolan,"By Mike Dolan
LONDON (Reuters) - Stock markets hitting record highs again must mean investors are up to their eyeballs in equity, right? Well, not yet it seems - or at least not everyone.
Casual observers of the stock market's dramatic bounceback this year are still rubbing their eyes in disbelief.
On Wednesday, MSCI's all-country benchmark of global stock prices (MIWD00000PUS) hit its highest level on record. That was just 137 trading days after the onset of a devastating pandemic that's triggered one of the deepest global recessions in modern history - a market round-trip involving a 35% plunge in the month to mid-March and a cumulative 50% rally from there.
The stock market is not the economy of course but the reasons for its bounce are well documented, not least that the pandemic is expected to be temporary and huge monetary and fiscal supports will bridge the gap to an expected vaccine. 
Longer term, the driver has been a likelihood that central banks will keep borrowing near zero for years to ensure government debt piles that funded massive support programmes remain affordable. That prospect lifts inflation expectations, assets that hedge inflation such as equities, boosts stock valuations versus bonds and cuts discount rates on future earnings.
Add to that the view the pandemic merely catalyzes existing mega trends in digital, pharma and biotech - even green economy investments thanks to long-sought loosening of fiscal policy.
So far, so good. But surely everyone is now loaded up with equity and sitting on one of the biggest ever bets on economies completing the recovery?
Not quite, reckon JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) analysts. They estimate non-bank investors with mixed asset portfolios are currently allocating just 41% to equity. 
That's lower than the average of the years since the banking crash 12 years ago and far below the early 2018 high of 47.6% - a level JPMorgan expects will be hit again. And, all things equal, allocations moving back up there would be commensurate with another 32% rise in world stock prices from here, they say. 
""Signs of over-extension are confined to individual U.S. stocks and momentum traders such as CTAs (Commodity Trading Advisors that are mostly hedge funds) with respect to their positioning on U.S. equity indices,"" the bank said.
But ""for the medium to long term, we still find overall low equity positioning.""
NUMBER CRUNCH
To get its final number, the report compared global M2 money supply - a proxy for the cash balances of households, companies, pension and insurance and sovereign wealth funds - with total assets under management worldwide, minus central bank and commercial bank holdings of bonds that are held for policy or regulatory purposes rather than investment.
From that, it assumed $64 trillion was parked in cash, $43 trillion in bonds and $73 trillion in equity - or 41%.
The number crunch also used proxies for market positioning and detailed how short-term players may have some cause for pause given price momentum signals from Wall St. But it showed global stocks far from overbought territory on that score.
And even though an estimated $500 billion of new short positions taken out on individual stocks at the end of February 
appears to have been covered already, shorts in Exchange Traded Funds tracking broad indexes have not yet subsided to pre-pandemic levels.
""There is a short base in equities to be covered at index level,"" said JPMorgan report.
Does all that bear up to reality, or even other guesstimates?
It tallies with Reuters own monthly asset allocation polls. For July, they showed fund managers recommending more bonds than equities for balanced portfolios for the first time and, at 43.8%, the lowest average equity recommendations in four years.
For a graphic on Allocations to equity still less than bonds in July:
https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/gjnvwaagovw/Assetpoll.PNG
Bank of America (NYSE:BAC)'s August funds survey also showed cautious global equity positioning despite crowded trades in tech. ""We do not think positioning is dangerously bullish,"" it said. 
And after reviewing mutual fund flows for August,  Barclays  (LON:BARC) this week also concluded that equity exposure was still ""light"".
""Ample dry powder to buy equities remains,"" it said, adding cash and bond holdings are still very high and another drop in volatility may see systematic funds intensify equity purchases.
""Overall positioning is not stretched, which continues to provide positive asymmetry to equities, in our view,"" it said.
Of course, historically low positioning doesn't mean investors will add any more. It may simply reflect inevitable uncertainty about the COVID-19 shock over the next 6-12 months. 
Further buying likely needs more signs of the pandemic ending in that timeframe, consumption returning to a semblance of pre-COVID norms and central banks matching the speculation that rates will be down here for years.

But it does show that any assumption of investor indigestion from equity at this point may be wide of the mark.

677,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 28, 2020 02:04AM ET</span>","European Stocks Seen Higher, Helped by New Fed Inflation Stance","By Peter Nurse 
Investing.com - European stock markets are set to open higher Friday, buoyed by the U.S. Federal Reserve’s new monetary policy framework which will likely see interest rates in the world’s dominant economy remaining low for longer.
At 2:05 AM ET (0605 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.5% higher, the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. rose 0.4%, while CAC 40 futures in France climbed 0.3%.
Under the new approach, the Federal Reserve will seek to achieve inflation averaging 2% over time, offsetting below-2% periods with higher inflation ""for some time,"" and to ensure employment doesn't fall short of its maximum level.
“Their new language gives them the flexibility to let the economy run a little hotter before contemplating raising interest rates and gives the green light to more modest yield curve steepening and dollar weakness,” analysts at ING said, in a research note.
The need for an accommodative policy was illustrated by Thursday’s weekly claims data which showed some 27 million Americans are still receiving some kind of government unemployment assistance.
Turning back to Europe, the German GfK consumer climate index disappointed, with the September figure dropping to -1.8 from -0.2 in August, a development that parallels the revival of the coronavirus in a country that had handled the first wave better than most. 
In corporate news, Norwegian Air Shuttle (OL:NORR) is likely to be in focus Friday after it warned that there is ""significant"" doubt over its ability to continue as a going concern if it can't meet its financial obligations next year.
Sanofi  (PA:SASY) said Friday that it intends to start a tender offer for the acquisition of U.S.-based biopharmaceutical company  Principia Biopharma  (NASDAQ:PRNB).
Oil prices were largely unchanged Friday, with Hurricane Laura blowing through Louisiana and Texas, the heart of the U.S. oil industry, without causing major damage to refineries.
“Limited refinery damage and the quick resumption of capacity is good news for crude oil demand, although for now that is not reflected in the market,” said analysts at ING, in a research note.
That said, WTI is on track to rise 1.5% this week, for a fourth straight week of gains, while Brent is heading for a weekly gain of 1.6%. 
U.S. crude futures traded flat at $43.05 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract rose 0.1% to $45.65. 
Elsewhere, gold futures rose 0.9% to $1,949.50/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.5% higher at 1.1877."
678,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 28, 2020 01:31AM ET</span>","U.S. big tech dominates stock market after monster rally, leaving investors on edge","By Lawrence Delevingne
BOSTON, MA.(Reuters) - U.S. technology giants are increasingly dominating the stock market in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic, even as they draw accusations of unfair business practices, and some investors fear the pump is primed for a tech-fueled sell-off.
The combined value of the S&P 500's five biggest companies - Apple Inc (O:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN),  Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT),  Facebook Inc  (O:FB) and Google parent Alphabet Inc (O:GOOGL) - now stands at more than $7 trillion, accounting for almost 25% of the index's market capitalization. That compares with less than 20% pre-pandemic.
The quintet's burgeoning share prices reflect a transition to an increasingly technology-driven economy that has been accelerated by the coronavirus outbreak, as doorways fill with Amazon packages, homebound families stream movies and friends commiserate on Facebook.
Yet the companies are drawing opposition. U.S. lawmakers are accusing them of stifling competition, a charge also leveled in recent days against Apple by Epic Games, creator of the popular game Fortnite.
Some investors worry the companies powering this year's equity rally could become the market's Achilles' heel if a legal assault, a shift to undervalued names or a move higher in bond yields dries up appetite for technology stocks.
""People see these companies as winners and investors are willing to pay any price to own them,"" said Michael O'Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading. ""That's always a risk.""
LEGAL THREAT 
One potential threat comes from an array of investigations and legal actions.
The latest came Monday, when a federal judge temporarily blocked Apple from cutting off all the developer accounts of Epic Games, pending a full hearing on the issue. It was a partial win for Epic, which had called Apple's rules an anticompetitive abuse of power. 
The standoff centers on Apple's App Store, which forms the centerpiece of a $46.3 billion-per-year services business that has helped buoy the company's share price.
The decision ""is just a first battle of many on the horizon,"" said Dan Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities. ""From a valuation perspective, there's clearly an overhang around antitrust.""
Wedbush nevertheless raised its target price for Apple on Wednesday to $700 a share in a ""bull case"" scenario, citing a ""once in a decade"" opportunity to take advantage of as many as 950 million potential iPhone upgrades worldwide. 
Apple shares on Thursday closed at $500.04.
Still, this week's Apple court decision may be a taste of things to come for technology giants, whose influence has been one of the few issues capable of galvanizing bipartisan interest among lawmakers. 
Alphabet, Facebook, Amazon and Apple face a series of federal government probes into allegations that they unfairly defend their market share, with litigation against Alphabet possible later this year.
""These few behemoths dominate their industry and can set the rules of the global economy,"" said U.S. Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat who has been outspoken about antitrust issues. ""This kind of concentrated power is always dangerous.""
The opposition is a worry for investors hoping the companies will continue delivering robust growth that justifies their valuations. 
Amazon said it operates in a ""fiercely competitive"" market, citing U.S. Census Bureau data that only about 10% of U.S. retail sales occur online. 
Apple declined comment. The company previously said it competes vigorously against Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) Co Ltd (KS:005930) and other Android device makers in the smart phone markets. 
Alphabet declined comment. It previously said it competes with Amazon, Microsoft, Comcast Corp (O:CMCSA), AT&T Inc (N:T) and many others. 
Facebook and Microsoft had no immediate comment. 
INVESTMENT DILEMMA
For some investors, the companies embody a dilemma that has dogged them at various times during the last decade. Many have found that cutting exposure to tech-related shares has limited portfolio performance over the long term. 
The Big Five have seen their shares jump 22% or more to record highs this year, with Amazon soaring 86%. By comparison, the median stock performance across the S&P 500 year-to-date is a 4% drop.
The companies' ""increased market share ... provides potentially huge opportunities supporting growth prospects over many years,"" said David Polak, equity investment director at $1.7 trillion Capital Group, which owns shares of big technology companies.
Still, some worry that a bad patch in the companies' widely owned shares could trigger violent swings in broader markets.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) analysts said in a recent report that the S&P 500 ""has never been more dependent on the continued strength of its largest constituents."" 
Another risk is a broad-based economic rebound boosting earnings of companies that have underperformed during the pandemic, potentially making their shares more competitive with tech stocks, said Edwin Jager, head of fundamental equities at hedge fund firm DE Shaw & Co, which oversees more than $50 billion.  
In addition, a sustained rise in bond yields could make growth stocks less attractive, Jager said. Longer-term Treasury yields hit multi-month highs on Thursday after the Federal Reserve announced a shift in monetary strategy.
A change of sentiment toward big tech could take a comparatively heavier toll on the shares of less profitable technology companies that have rallied alongside the market's giants.

Investors justify these stocks on the basis that ""this time it's different,"" said Ed Cole, managing director of equities at $27 billion Man GLG. ""It rarely ever is.""

Investing.com – Asian stocks were mostly up on Friday morning, with investors digesting the U.S. Federal Reserve’s new approach to setting monetary policy.
The approach will see the Fed let inflation and employment run higher, a move that will likely keep interest rates low. The result of a review that took over a year, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said that the Fed will seek inflation averaging 2% over time and adjust its view of full employment, allowing labor-market gains to reach more workers.
“Maximum employment is a broad-based and inclusive goal... this change reflects our appreciation for the benefits of a strong labor market, particularly for many in low- and moderate-income communities,” Powell said in his speech at the Jackson Hole symposium on Thursday.
Some investors were positive over the new policy, which tackles years of too-low inflation rates and gives the Fed more flexibility to let the job market run hotter, as well as let price pressures float higher, before it acts.
“Monetary policy is likely to stay accommodative for even longer,” Tai Hui, chief Asia market strategist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Asset Management, told Bloomberg.
“Not only will the Fed need to provide sufficient support to help the economy through the pandemic fallout, but also policy rates should be kept low beyond that to generate sufficient inflationary pressure.”
Japan’s Nikkei 225 was up 0.64% by 11:29 PM ET (4:29 AM GMT), with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe due to hold a press conference later in the day to address his health.
South Korea’s KOSPI jumped 1.23.%. But the country stopped short of imposing phase 3 social distancing measures, the highest available, despite recording 371 new COVID-19 cases as of midnight Thursday. Phase 2 measures, originally due to expire over the weekend, have been extended for at least another week.

(Reuters) - Apparel retailer Gap Inc (N:GPS) reported a surprise 13% rise in quarterly comparable sales on Thursday, as consumers stuck at home due to the COVID-19 pandemic bought more of its Old Navy and Athleta clothing online. 
People working or studying from home have been stocking up on comfortable ""stay at home"" clothes including fleece and activewear, boosting demand for the company's budget-friendly Old Navy brand, athleisure label Athleta as well as Gap clothing. 
Same-store sales rose 13%, compared with analysts' forecast of a 20.97% fall, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. 
The San Francisco-based retailer said it nearly doubled its e-commerce business for the quarter ended Aug. 1, with about 50% online penetration, and added about 3.5 million new customers.
""We won in the value space with Old Navy, and we won in the premium space of Athleta,"" Chief Executive Officer Sonia Syngal told analysts, adding that the company sold about $130 million worth of masks alone. 
While the company expects demand for the two brands to fuel sales, it plans to close over 225 unprofitable Gap and Banana Republic stores globally as a part of its restructuring plan. 
The back-to-school season, one of the busiest periods for the company, could extend longer and Gap is ready with the ""right assortment"" for kids whether they are learning at home or in a classroom, Syngal said. 
Gap reported second-quarter net loss of $62 million, or 17 cents per share, compared to a profit of $168 million, or 44 cents per share, a year earlier. 
Net sales fell about 18% to $3.28 billion, but were above expectations of $2.91 billion.

687,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 27, 2020 04:40PM ET</span>","S&P, Dow close higher on new Fed inflation stance, COVID test hopes","By Stephen Culp
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The S&P 500 and the Dow advanced but the Nasdaq closed lower on Thursday as investors digested the U.S. Federal Reserve's new strategy to adopt an average inflation target and restore the United States to full employment, as well as a promising development in the fight to contain the coronavirus pandemic. 
The Fed's new strategy sent Treasury yields higher, which gave a lift to interest rate-sensitive financials.
""The steepening of the yield curve is a welcome addition, particularly on a day where the market is rising,"" said Matthew Keator, managing partner in the Keator Group, a wealth management firm in Lenox, Massachusetts. 
The financial sector provided the biggest boost to the S&P 500 and the Dow, pushing the former to its fifth straight record closing high and the latter within a hair's breadth of reclaiming positive territory for the year so far. 
The Dow remains more than 3.6% below its record high reached in February.
Stocks lost steam late in the session following House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi issued a statement saying Democrats and Republicans remain far apart over the next stimulus bill.
Declines in market-leading momentum stocks capped gains in the S&P and Dow and held the Nasdaq in the red. 
""There seems to be a bit of rotation with regards to the news today and how the market has responded, giving the markets a value bump,"" Keator added.
Shares of  Abbott Laboratories  (NYSE:ABT) jumped 7.8% after the company won U.S. approval to market a cheap, portable, rapid COVID-19 antigen test, which could be a step toward containing the pandemic that sent the U.S. economy spiraling into recession.
Economic recovery was forefront in Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's remarks made as part of the Kansas City Fed's virtual Jackson Hole symposium. In the speech Powell outlined the central bank's aggressive new strategy to support the economy by lifting inflation and returning the economy to full employment.
""The statement by Powell in some regards is telegraphing a continued dovish stance for quite some time,"" Keator said. 
But with last week's initial jobless claims stubbornly hovering above the 1 million mark, according to the Labor Department, a return to full employment currently appears to be a long haul.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 160.35 points, or 0.57%, to 28,492.27, the S&P 500 gained 5.82 points, or 0.17%, to 3,484.55 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 39.72 points, or 0.34%, to 11,625.34.
Of the 11 major sectors in the S&P 500, financials enjoyed the biggest percentage gain while communications services, weighed down by Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) and  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB), lagged. 
Shares of Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc and  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) rose 4.5% and 2.5%, respectively after announcing a joint bid for TikTok's U.S. assets. 
Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co rose 1.3% after the European Union Aviation Safety Agency announced plans to begin flight tests of its grounded 737 MAX plane. 
Cosmetics maker Coty (NYSE:COTY) Inc plunged 8.1% after retail closures and weak demand led to a bigger-than-expected quarterly loss.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.16-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.18-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
The S&P 500 posted 39 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 62 new highs and 27 new lows. 

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 9.16 billion shares, compared with the 9.37 billion average over the last 20 trading days.

CHICAGO (Reuters) - United Airlines (O:UAL) is preparing for the biggest pilot furloughs of its history after announcing on Thursday the need to cut 2,850 pilot jobs this year, or about 21% of the total, without further U.S. government aid.
Airlines, reeling from the devastating impact of the novel coronavirus pandemic on air travel, have asked the U.S. government for another $25 billion to cover employee payroll through March.
The first tranche, which banned any job cuts until Oct. 1, expires at the end of September, but talks in Washington have stalled as Congress has struggled to reach agreement on a broader coronavirus assistance package.
United's planned cuts, released in a memo to employees and shared with the media, would run between Oct. 1 and Nov. 30. They are significantly higher than the 1,900 announced earlier this week by Delta Air Lines (N:DAL) and 1,600 by American Airlines (O:AAL).
Facing a shrinking industry in the years ahead, airlines have generally tried to mitigate the number of forced job cuts by offering early retirement or voluntary departure deals, but some carriers' packages have been more attractive than others.
""While other airlines have chosen to reduce manpower through voluntary means, it is tragic that United has limited those options for our pilots and instead has chosen to furlough more pilots than ever before in our history,"" the union representing United's 13,000 pilots said in a statement.
United said the numbers were based on current travel demand for the remainder of the year and its anticipated flying schedule, which it said ""continues to be fluid with the resurgence of COVID-19 in regions across the U.S.""
Chicago-based United is more exposed than its peers to international travel, which is expected to take longer to rebound from the pandemic.
United, which has warned that 36,000 jobs are on the line across the company, has not yet provided final furlough numbers for other work groups.
American said on Tuesday it was cutting 19,000 jobs in addition to voluntary reductions that will see the company's workforce shrink by about 30%.

United's announcement comes on the final day of the Republican National Convention, where President Donald Trump will try to regain momentum against the backdrop of a pandemic that has killed over 180,000 Americans and produced a recession that has resulted in the loss of millions of jobs.

(Reuters) - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc shares continued their meteoric rise on Thursday, scoring yet another record high and further expanding the distance between the Silicon Valley electric carmaker and its traditional auto industry rivals.
Tesla shares rose to $2,290 in mid-day trading before leveling out at $2,240, the highest price since the company went public at $17 a share in 2010.
Tesla's shares have risen more than 420% since the beginning of this year, turning some retail investors into millionaires. 
While other carmakers are forced to invest billions to overhaul their internal combustion engine operations to produce battery-powered cars, investors are confident that Tesla can make the shift from a niche carmaker into a global leader in cleaner cars.
Tesla became the world's most valuable carmaker by market capitalization when it overtook former front runner Toyota Motors Corp on July 1. The company now accounts for 41% of the total market cap of a group of 12 of the world's largest automakers.
(Graphic: Tesla stock rally dwarfs rivals' market cap Tesla stock rally dwarfs rivals' market cap - https://graphics.reuters.com/TESLA-STOCKS/xklvynnqepg/chart.png)
Tesla produces only a fraction of the vehicles sold by established global carmakers, many of which are considered growth engines for their local economies. 
Japan's Toyota and Germany's Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p) sold 10.46 million and 11 million vehicles, respectively, during the 2019 financial year. That compares to the 367,200 vehicles Tesla delivered in 2019.
Tesla has said it would deliver at least half a million vehicles by the end of 2020, less than 5% of Toyota's and Volkswagen's annual sales. 

But Tesla withstood industry-wide fallout from the novel coronavirus pandemic and in July reported a second-quarter profit, clearing a hurdle that could lead to the electric carmaker's inclusion in the S&P 500 index.

(Reuters) - America's biggest dollar store chains reported better-than-expected quarterly profit on Thursday, as cash-strapped consumers sought lower priced groceries and household items in a coronavirus-induced economic downturn.
Sales at  Dollar General Corp  (N:DG) and  Dollar Tree Inc  (O:DLTR) remained robust even after the panic-buying surge at the start of lockdowns, with high U.S. unemployment pushing demand for cheaper cereals, vegetables and daily essentials.
The two dollar stores said sales of more discretionary items including clothing were also up, as households spent government stimulus checks carefully. 
But with talks over the new COVID-19 stimulus package stuck in a stalemate, Dollar General warned that comparable sales could moderate from the current 15% growth levels in the coming months. 
Smaller rival Dollar Tree remained optimistic for the year, but did not provide a sales outlook. 
""We're going to be in a good position in the back half of the year and going into next year when customers are going to need us most as the extra benefits go away and with the unemployment rate where it is,"" Dollar Tree's new Chief Executive Officer Mike Witynski said.
While shoppers are spending more at dollar stores, they are making fewer trips, which according to Evercore ISI analysts is an opportunity for Walmart Inc (N:WMT) and Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) to pull away customers with their better developed e-commerce operations.

Dollar General's second-quarter same-store sales rose 18.8% and beat estimates of a 15.1% increase, but that of Dollar Tree was not as strong, rising 7.2% and sending its shares down 5%.
Net income at Dollar General rose 84.6% to $787.6 million, or $3.12 per share, beating expectations of $2.44. The company said it had begun share buybacks and would repurchase an additional $2 billion worth of stock.

Dollar Tree, which owns the Family Dollar chain, said net income rose 45% to $261.5 million, or $1.10 per share, beating analysts' estimate of 92 cents.

696,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 27, 2020 02:35PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Glencore puts entire stake in Mopani on the table in talks with Zambia: sources,"By Helen Reid and Zandi Shabalala
JOHANNESBURG/LONDON (Reuters) - Glencore (OTC:GLNCY) will likely sell its entire 73.1% stake in Zambia's Mopani Copper Mines to the government's mining investment arm ZCCM-IH rather than becoming a minority stakeholder, two sources with direct knowledge told Reuters.
Zambia and Swiss-based Glencore are at ""cross purposes"" over Mopani, Zambian Mines Minister Richard Musukwa had said on Tuesday when he announced ZCCM-IH aims to increase its shareholding in Mopani to 51% ""or even more"", from 10% currently.
Glencore's plans to put Mopani on care and maintenance prompted the Zambian government to threaten in April to revoke the firm's mining licences.
Two sources with direct knowledge of the negotiations said Glencore is looking to exit the asset entirely.
""As of now, we are discussing a potential sale of their stake in Mopani,"" said one of the sources.
A Glencore spokesman declined to comment. First Quantum (NASDAQ:QMCO), which owns 16.9% of Mopani, did not respond to a request for comment.
The move by ZCCM-IH to take control of Mopani is part of its strategy shift away from minority stakes and towards running mines as an operator.
Glencore wrote off the value of Mopani by $1.144 billion in its half-year earnings report earlier this month, saying the estimated recoverable value was $704 million, including tax receivables.
Mopani's total liabilities exceeded its total assets by $2.562 billion in 2019, the company reported in a financial statement, indicating ""a material uncertainty in relation to the going concern assumption"". 
Mopani produced 51,275 tonnes of finished copper in 2019 including purchased materials - accounting for 13.9% of Glencore's African copper output and 3.7% of its overall copper output. 
Glencore, which reported a first-half loss due to the impact of the pandemic, will not reap the benefits of billions spent on expansion projects over the last three years if it sells to ZCCM-IH but investors see this as a way for the miner to cut its losses.
""Mopani has been a big headache for Glencore, the mine has never delivered anything for shareholders,"" a Glencore shareholder, who asked not to be identified, said, citing numerous accidents and operational issues.
CASH CONSTRAINTS
A major hurdle to clinching the deal is Zambia's lack of funds to pay for the stake and fund the mine's running costs, sources say. 
Glencore's stake in Mopani is worth $514.6 million, according to its own valuation. Mopani's 2019 financial statement shows operating expenses of $931 million. 
Zambia's total foreign exchange reserves stood at $1.43 billion at the end of June, equivalent to just 2.3 months of import cover, according to the central bank. 
ZCCM-IH's cash and term deposits together amounted to 828.9 million Zambian kwacha ($43 million) by March 31 2019, according to the latest financial statements on its website. 
A ZCCM-IH spokeswoman did not reply to Reuters' questions about how it would finance the stake purchase.
""The state's cash constraints point to an amicable solution,"" said Eric Humphery-Smith, Africa analyst at global risk advisory firm Verisk (NASDAQ:VRSK) Maplecroft. 

""The government may have threatened expropriation in the past, but the need for copper revenues likely precludes that option.""

The portable antigen tests, which can deliver results within 15 minutes and will sell for $5, received emergency use authorization from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Wednesday.
The portable test from Abbott is about the size of a credit card, requires no additional equipment to operate, and can be conducted using a less invasive nasal swab than traditional lab tests.
Antigen tests are cheaper and faster than molecular diagnostic tests, but somewhat more likely to fail to identify positive cases of the virus than lab-based diagnostic tests.

Investing.com -- U.S. stocks lost momentum Thursday, as tech stocks led the S&P 500 and Nasdaq lower even after comments from the Federal Reserve initially ignited a rally.
Stocks jumped earlier in the day after Fed Chairman Jerome Powell laid out a change in the central bank's approach to policy-making that is likely to rule out any hike in interest rates for some years. 
But by 1:00 PM ET (1700 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 78 points, or 0.28%, giving up a gain of more than 250 points in the morning. The S&P 500 was flat and the Nasdaq Composite, after a series of record highs, was down 0.7%.
""“The Committee seeks to achieve inflation that averages 2% over time, and therefore judges that, following periods when inflation has been running persistently below 2%, appropriate monetary policy will likely aim to achieve inflation immediately above 2% for some time,” The Fed said in an accompanying statement. 
Analysts welcomed the move, which acknowledges the trouble the Fed has had in getting inflation up to the level that aligns best with its other goal, full employment. However, it now puts an extra onus on the central bank to achieve its goals.
The pandemic was also behind  Abbott Laboratories  's (NYSE:ABT) 7.7% rise, after the Food and Drug Administration gave Emergency Use Authorization to its Covid-19 rapid testing kit. 
In the premarket session, stocks had barely reacted to data showing that initial jobless claims stayed stuck above 1 million for another week last week, while continuing claims fell less than hoped. The news was somewhat offset by an upward revision to - admittedly historical - second-quarter gross domestic product data. Of more immediate importance was a rise in pending home sales in July to their highest level since 2005, in fresh evidence of the housing boom triggered by the pandemic and the attendant cuts in interest rates."

(Reuters) - Startup electric vehicle company Bollinger Motors said on Thursday it plans to make an all-electric delivery van starting in 2022, joining a growing field of manufacturers vying to bring models to market amid growing demand from major delivery fleets.
The company has been working on bringing pickup trucks for consumers to market, but Chief Executive Robert Bollinger said the impetus for the DELIVER-E model came from other manufacturers seeking electric delivery vans.
Rising e-commerce has spurred interest in electric delivery vans. In June, California also approved a groundbreaking policy requiring manufacturers to sell a rising number of zero-emission vehicles, starting in 2024.
""Everyone knows there's a lot of players in this electric delivery space,"" Bollinger told Reuters. ""But the need for electric vehicles is much greater than anyone can produce at this point.""
The Detroit area startup is in talks with contract manufacturers in the United States to produce the DELIVER-E, which will come in a variety of medium-duty truck sizes - from Class 2B through to Class 5. 
The DELIVER-E vans will have a variety of battery packs available, allowing a maximum range of up to 200 miles. But as most U.S. delivery routes are much shorter than that, customers will be able to opt for smaller, cheaper battery packs to suit their needs, Bollinger said.
Encouraged by the popularity of electric carmaker Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) among investors, some electric vehicle startups have sought to emulate the success of electric commercial truck maker  Nikola Corp  (O:NKLA), which went public via a special purpose acquisition company, or SPAC. Nikola's shares are up nearly 300% since their stock market debut in June.
Bollinger has been mentioned by dealmakers and industry executives as a potential SPAC target.
""We did have a number of SPACs contact us looking to do something and it just wasn't the right time for us,"" Bollinger said.

705,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 27, 2020 12:36PM ET</span>",U.S. Government Acts to Reduce Distortion in Jobless-Claims Data,"(Bloomberg) -- The U.S. Labor Department said Thursday it’s changing how it adjusts weekly jobless-claims figures for seasonal swings after the pandemic’s surge in unemployment led to an unusually large divergence between adjusted and unadjusted figures.
Unadjusted jobless-claims figures experience major fluctuations around holidays such as Christmas and other annual events like summer auto-factory shutdowns, when companies add and lay off large numbers of workers. The Labor Department uses a process called seasonal adjustment to smooth the figures for these anticipated changes.
While there are typically occasional challenges with the process, the unadjusted and seasonally adjusted jobless-claims figures tend to move in tandem.
But the pandemic has wreaked havoc on the Labor Department’s typical method of seasonal adjustment, in some cases severely overshooting or undershooting the non-seasonally adjusted figure. At one point in March, the adjusted claims figure was more than 851,000 higher than the unadjusted figure. In the last two months, the series have occasionally moved in different directions on a given week.
Many economists have increasingly focused on unadjusted figures in recent months.
In statistical terminology, the Labor Department has traditionally used “multiplicative factors” to adjust the claims data. That means multiplying the unadjusted number by a certain percentage each week. The alternative is an “additive factor,” which entails adding or subtracting a number from the claims figure to adjust it.
When the economy is relatively stable, the multiplicative factor is “generally preferred over the additive option,” the Labor Department said Thursday. But when there’s a sudden, large shift in a series -- like the pandemic driving initial claims well into the millions, from just over 200,000 -- a multiplicative factor can lead to systematic over- or under-adjustment.
Starting in next week’s release, the Labor Department will use additive factors, since in cases such as now, “they tend to more accurately track seasonal fluctuations in the series and have smaller revisions,” the department said in Thursday’s jobless claims report.
“Seasonals are just not designed for this kind of a crisis, so the additive makes more sense in this circumstance,” said Erica Groshen, a former Bureau of Labor Statistics commissioner. “You can see that in the extraordinary circumstances where we are now that a percentage would probably mislead you.”
Whether already published claims data that used the multiplicative factor will be revised is unclear, but that likely won’t happen until the beginning of 2021 when prior years of seasonally adjusted estimates are subject to revision.

In late June, Coty announced a strategic relationship with Kim Kardashian West, under which Coty will acquire a 20% interest in her beauty business for $200 million and gain a license for new beauty categories. The acquisition is expected to close in the third quarter of the 2021 fiscal year.

711,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 27, 2020 10:18AM ET</span>","U.S. Pending Home Sales Top Forecasts, at Highest Since 2005","(Bloomberg) -- U.S. pending home sales rose in July by more than forecast to the highest level since 2005, signaling the housing market’s sharp recovery will continue with borrowing costs to stay low for the foreseeable future.
The National Association of Realtors’ index of contract signings to purchase previously owned homes increased 5.9% from the prior month after a 15.8% jump in June, according to data released Thursday. The median forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg called for a 2% gain. Compared with a year ago, pending sales were up 15.4% on an unadjusted basis.
The gauge’s rebound following an initial decline at the pandemic’s start shows that housing continues to be an area of strength for the recovering U.S. economy, in part because people are looking for more space while being stuck at home. That said, unemployment remains elevated and income uncertainty could slow demand for residential real estate.
“We are witnessing a true V-shaped sales recovery as homebuyers continue their strong return to the housing market,” Lawrence Yun, NAR’s chief economist, said in a statement. Anecdotally, agents are saying that “scarce inventory remains a problem,” Yun said.
Pending home sales rose 25.2% in the Northeast and 6.8% in the West. Gains were smaller in other regions, with a 3.3% increase in the Midwest and 0.9% in the South.
The NAR revised its projection for existing home sales this year to 5.4 million units, up from a prior forecast of 5.18 million units. The group also estimates new-home sales of 800,000, up from 704,000.
A separate report on Tuesday showed that purchases of new single-family houses rose to their highest level since 2006 in July, further highlighting the surge in demand for housing.

Many users took to Twitter to complain about missing out on an otherwise exciting event for the global gaming community, while some raved about the latest version.
""So sad for my son who is an avid and brilliant fortnite iPad player. I was hoping things would be resolved,"" @MellieTheMinx1 tweeted.
Apple has removed the game from its App Store after Epic Games challenged the company's policy of taking a cut of purchases made inside the app by allowing users to pay Epic directly at a cheaper price.
Dubbed ""Nexus War"", the new version features Marvel characters including Thor, Iron Man, She-Hulk, Storm and Doctor Doom.
""This is absolutely insane,"" Tyler Blevins said as he retweeted a trailer video of the game. Known to millions as ""Ninja"", Blevins is one of the most-followed computer gamers globally.
""Fortnite"" and its early rival, Tencent-backed ""PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds"" (PUBG), popularized an arena-style battle royale survival concept where 100 gamers are dropped onto an island to fight each other to the death.

715,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 27, 2020 09:00AM ET</span>",Europe air safety regulator to start 737 MAX flight tests from September 7,"(Reuters) - The European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) said on Thursday it plans to begin flight tests of U.S. planemaker  Boeing Co 's (N:BA) 737 MAX plane in Vancouver, Canada, in the week starting Sept. 7. 
The test flights will start more than two months after the U.S. regulator, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), and Boeing completed certification test flights on the 737 MAX, a move viewed as a key milestone toward its return to service. 
The jets have been grounded since March 2019 after two fatal crashes in five months killed 346 people.
""While Boeing still has some final actions to close off, EASA judges the overall maturity of the re-design process is now sufficient to proceed to flight tests,"" the agency said.
EASA has been working with the FAA and Boeing to schedule the flight tests, a process which was hindered by COVID-19 travel restrictions between Europe and the United States.
Meanwhile, pilots from Boeing and Canada's transportation watchdog Transport Canada started flight tests of the 737 MAX jetliner on Wednesday, according to one industry source and FlightAware data.
Once the countries complete their flights tests, the Joint Operational Evaluation Board, which includes regulators from Canada, Europe and Brazil, will run simulator exercises to evaluate proposed changes to pilot training.
If reviews of the 737 MAX's safety upgrades and accompanying training protocols do not raise new concerns, the FAA will issue an order rescinding the grounding of the plane.
Boeing told analysts in late July that 737 MAX deliveries would resume in the fourth quarter, a timeline that raises the prospect that the aircraft's U.S. return to service could slip into 2021.

The U.S. jet manufacturer's shares were up 0.6% at $172.90 in premarket trading.

716,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 27, 2020 08:54AM ET</span>","Free From FANG Dominance, Stock Pickers Are Doing Best Overseas","(Bloomberg) -- The megacap technology companies powering the U.S. stock rally are bedeviling active fund managers.
Just 48% of actively managed U.S. equity funds outperformed their benchmark in the first six months of 2020, according to a Morningstar Inc. report Thursday. Meanwhile, almost 60% of active foreign-stock funds did better than their index-tracking counterparts in that span.
The diverging fortunes are largely due to the narrow breadth of the U.S. equity rebound. While the S&P 500 Index has surged 55% since late March, gains have primarily been driven by the popular group of tech stocks known as the FANGs, which benefited from the “stay-at-home” trade popular amid the coronavirus. U.S. stock pickers had to embrace those companies or lag behind their benchmarks, while foreign-stock gains have been broader, making managers of those funds less dependent on picking just a few outperformers, Morningstar’s Ben Johnson said.
“Especially over past six months within the U.S., the bar has been pretty high for U.S. large-cap funds in particular given the degree of concentration we’ve seen,” Johnson, global director of ETF research, said in an interview.
Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) shares make up almost 12% of the S&P 500 Index. When combined with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), the group accounts for about a quarter of the gauge. An index of the tech titans has climbed 79% from March’s lows.
That level of concentration doesn’t exist in overseas equity markets, according to Johnson.
“That’s something you don’t see for the most part outside the U.S.,” Johnson said.

Conti (DE:CONG) commissioned the independent research by historian Paul Erker to explore the darkest chapter of the company's history. It provides an opportunity to learn from the past to create a better future, the company said. 
""The study shows that Continental was an important part of Hitler's war machine,"" Conti Chief Executive Elmar Degenhart said.
The research, which included units VDO, Teves, Phoenix and Semperit, which were not part of Conti at the time, exposed how corporate culture was distorted and how the firm shifted from making products for the Nazi's consumer society to arms.
Conti used 10,000 forced labourers during World War Two from occupied Belgium and France as well as Soviet prisoners of war, the study showed, which is entitled ""Supplier to Hitler's War. The Continental Group in the Nazi Era"". 
In the last years of the war, concentration camp inmates made gas masks and shifted production to underground sites with inhumane living and working conditions, it said.
Many German companies profited from forced labourers who toiled in abominable conditions for little or no pay. Many died.
It took Germany until 2000 to create a forced labour compensation fund which had paid more than 4.37 billion euros ($5.2 billion) to around 1.7 million victims by 2007. Contributors included Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p),  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) and Bayer (OTC:BAYRY). 
Thousands of firms supported Hitler's war economy. Some bankrolled the effort, others manufactured arms or even chemicals like Zyklon B, used in gas chambers.
""Business has a responsibility to help preserve democracy,"" Degenhart told journalists, adding the study would feed into training programmes to promote social responsibility and help tackle racist and radical views.

TOKYO (Reuters) - A Japanese mobility venture has unveiled two adapted vans, one which can serve as a workspace or a mobile shop, and another that pumps fresh air through the vehicle to reduce the risk of COVID-19 spreading between passengers. 
It is the first commercial offering from Monet, a joint venture between SoftBank Corp (T:9434) and Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203). 
In one version, the adapted Toyota Hiace van takes in outside air and circulates it through the interior, which is also fitted with screens and curtains to limit virus transmission. It can seat eight passengers in the back. The other version of the van allows users to fix fittings to the floor and arrange the interior as a shop or work space.
The Monet joint venture was first announced in October 2018 with the goal of becoming a platform for driverless services. 
Neither design incorporates self-driving technology and, in the case of the multi-purpose design, Japan's road rules require fittings such as tables to be stored before moving off. 
The venture hopes to sell 100 units in Japan to customers from government and companies this financial year. 

Monet is the first alliance between Japan's largest automaker and its No.3 wireless carrier and has attracted support from other domestic automakers as the industry races to develop autonomous vehicles and services.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are set to open lower Thursday, consolidating after record levels the previous session, ahead of a key speech from Federal Reserve head Jerome Powell.
At 7:10 AM ET (1110 GMT), S&P 500 Futures traded 7 points, or 0.2%, lower, the Dow Futures contract fell 80 points, or 0.3%, while Nasdaq 100 Futures dropped 19 points, or 0.2%. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.3% Wednesday, to close at a new 6-months high, while the S&P 500 index added 1%, and the Nasdaq Composite index added 1.7%, new record closing highs.
The major indexes are on course for their fifth straight positive month. The Nasdaq is seeing its best August in 20 years, the S&P and DJIA haven't done better in August since 1986 and 1984, respectively.
Fed Chairman Jerome Powell will be in the spotlight when he speaks later Thursday to the central bank’s Jackson Hole conference, being held virtually this year because of the coronavirus pandemic.
“Expect Powell to reveal the key conclusions of the Bank’s framework review,” said analysts at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), in a research note. “And that will be the FOMC adopting average inflation targeting. AIT means the Bank aiming for 2%-2.5% inflation when the economy is at or near full employment.”
Economic data will also be keenly studied Thursday, with the weekly initial jobless claims release due at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT). Expectations are for this number to be 1 million, down slightly from the 1.11 million new unemployment claims the previous week, while continuing jobless claims are seen at 14.4 million, also down slightly from 14.8 million the prior week.
The latest revision of the gross national product number for the second quarter is also due at the same time, and is expected to be revised up slightly to -32.5% in annualized terms from an initial reading of -32.9%.
Earnings releases are due from the likes of cosmetics giant Coty (NYSE:COTY) and makeup retailer Ulta Beauty (NASDAQ:ULTA).
Oil prices slipped Thursday as Hurricane Laura made landfall in Louisiana, threatening to devastate the U.S. Gulf Coast, an area with nearly half of America’s refining capacity.
That said, the prospect of a powerful hurricane is having a smaller impact on the market than would have been expected in the past: inventories remain high as a result of the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on fuel demand in the first half of the year.

726,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 27, 2020 07:00AM ET</span>",Running on empty? Emerging markets burn through reserves fighting virus,"By Tom Arnold and Karin Strohecker
LONDON (Reuters) - Reserves are running out for several emerging markets as governments from Belize to Zambia use up their financial firepower to fight the coronavirus crisis.
The problem is particularly acute for those burning through reserves to tackle additional challenges, from sliding economies to a shortfall in commodity or oil revenues.
Among the larger emerging markets, Turkey stands out, having seen its gross foreign exchange reserves nearly halve this year as it sought to defend its currency.
But it is the smaller and riskier developing economies - so-called frontier markets - that are feeling the heat most: Lebanon, in the grip of a financial crisis, can only subsidise fuel, wheat and medicine for three more months. South Sudan, battered by years of conflict and corruption, has run out of foreign exchange reserves altogether. And warning lights are flashing in other countries from Bahrain to Zambia.
Below three graphics to assess financing strains in countries:
1/IMPORT COVER
By traditional rules of thumb, reserves should cover the equivalent of three months of imports. By this measure, a host of emerging markets are in trouble or close to it.
Bahrain, Barbados and Belize were worst off with usable reserves - or money readily available to cover current account payments - in the negative, S&P Global Ratings data showed.
""Zambia's reserves are worryingly low at around $1.4bn in June, 2.3 months of import (cover),"" said Patrick Curran, senior economist at Tellimer.
2/ SHORT-TERM DEBT TO FX RESERVES
With the focus shifting on countries' exposure to international financial markets, much focus has been on looking at FX reserves in relation to short-term debt.
Ethiopia, Tajikistan, Belarus and Jordan all fall short of having enough reserves to cover debt coming due in the next 12 months. Turkey also finds itself high up on the list.
""Zambia and Ethiopia currently have very low useable reserves as a proportion of months of CAPs (current account payments),"" said Ravi Bhatia, S&P's lead analyst on emerging, frontier markets.
3/ RESERVE ADEQUACY METRICS
Covering various aspects of what reserves are used for - and how vulnerable countries are to shocks from all sides - reserve adequacy metrics should see countries score at least 100%.
Ecuador and Belarus both find themselves scoring much lower, while South Africa also falls short of crossing the threshold.
""For many of the countries the metrics are worsening,"" said David Hauner, head of emerging markets cross-asset strategy for EMEA at Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) Global Research. ""For frontier markets they are definitely low and that is why we have seen many of them turn to the IMF and there will probably be more to come.”"

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Delta Air Lines (N:DAL) is facing a fresh Latin American headache as a Monday deadline nears for former Brazilian partner Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes (SA:GOLL4) to repay a $300 million loan that the U.S. carrier guaranteed. 
If Gol fails to repay - which ratings agencies say is looking more likely - Delta would have to honor the debt on Gol's behalf, honoring the five-year-old agreement. But just like Gol, the Atlanta-based carrier, which said in July it was burning $27 million a day https://www.reuters.com/article/us-delta-air-results/delta-ceo-says-demand-at-a-stall-2019-business-travel-may-never-return-idUSKCN24F193, has little cash to spare due to the coronavirus pandemic. 
Gol's struggles are just the latest challenge for Delta, whose investments in Latin America, once seen as a growth area, have faltered due to COVID-19. 
Delta's 49% stake in Aeromexico and 20% stake in LATAM Airlines (OTC:LTMAQ) Group are at risk of dilution or being wiped https://www.reuters.com/article/us-delta-air-latam-bankruptcy-analysis-idUSKBN2431HV out as both airlines undergo bankruptcy restructurings. 
For Gol, Brazil's largest carrier, the due date of the Delta-backed private loan comes amid a severe cash crunch. The loan was extended by unidentified private investors. 
""Gol is facing constant cash burn without refinancing possibilities,"" said Amalia Bulacios, who covers Gol for S&P Global Ratings, which rates its debt as CCC-, at risk of default.
By Monday, before repaying the loan, Gol could have just 1.6 billion reais ($285.19 million) left in cash, Reuters calculated. The calculation is based on Gol's cash and cash equivalents, as well as its liquid investments, as of June 30, minus its expected cash burn of 3 million reais a day. 
""We are three business days away from the deadline and the company has been very silent; it's not even clear if there is a negotiation under way,"" she added. 
Gol and Delta declined to confirm if any negotiations were occurring. A source familiar with the matter said negotiations were indeed taking place. 
The situation echoes that of Colombia's Avianca Holdings (CN:AVT_p) in May, when it filed for bankruptcy because of a debt repayment deadline the next day. Analysts, however, said Gol's restructuring needs are much simpler than Avianca's and could potentially happen out of court. 
Raising cash at the 11th hour, however, appears unlikely. 
While Brazil's government has offered Gol 2 billion reais ($356.49 million) in loans, two sources said it would not release the money unless Gol manages to postpone its debt deadline. Brazil wants the funds to be used on the airline's operations, not to repay creditors. 
Meanwhile, Gol executives acknowledged last month that the airline has little prospect of raising fresh capital. 
""There's a certain aversion to Brazil, a certain aversion to airlines, and then we're kind of in the cross-set of that bucket,"" Gol's CFO Richard Lark said during the company's earnings call. ""It's not really there, the private market."" 
DEBT UNDERPLAYED
Gol's debt troubles show how quickly the coronavirus upended the balance sheets of airlines around the world. 
For years, Gol underplayed the significance of the $300 million loan. Executives said not only that they would repay it in full but that they would do so ahead of schedule. 
As late as Feb. 25, even as the pandemic raged in Asia and Europe, a Gol presentation said the airline had ""no relevant maturities in next five years.""
Now, Gol's future hangs in the balance because of the once apparently insignificant loan coming due. 
Delta, which has long expanded worldwide by buying into other carriers, in 2015 injected $56 million of equity into Gol and guaranteed the $300 million loan. At the time, Gol executives said they could not have raised the debt without Delta's backing. 
Delta sold its stake in Gol in 2019 to buy its stake in Gol rival LATAM Airlines but maintained the loan guarantee.
If Gol fails to make the payment and Delta is forced to step in, Delta will have the option of seizing the Brazilian airline's stake in its publicly traded loyalty program, Smiles Fidelidade (SA:SMLS3), which secured the loan. 
But Gol's stake in Smiles is only worth 954 million reais ($170.04 million). And the loyalty program has little strategic value given that Delta ditched Gol for LATAM Airlines. 
""If Delta does that, it will strangle Gol's cash position, put Gol's survival at risk and become a shareholder of Smiles, a company that itself needs Gol to be successful,"" said Ricardo Fenelon, a former head of Brazil's aviation regulator ANAC. 
""It doesn't make much sense.""

730,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 27, 2020 05:49AM ET</span>",StockBeat: Boom Times Beckon for U.K. Estate Agents,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- The U.K. housing market is changing for good as a result of the pandemic, but you wouldn’t necessarily guess it from looking at the sector’s stocks.
Activity in the housing market has rocketed in the weeks since the U.K. government relaxed its restrictions on viewings, as wealthy city-dwellers sell up in search of more space in the suburbs and beyond. Even if most don’t expect to work from home constantly forever, it’s a contingency that for many has become necessary to plan for.
According to Zoopla, the country’s second-biggest online platform for property sales, the time taken to sell a house has fallen 31% from last summer.
“This is not just pent-up demand returning to the market,” Zoopla said. “It also reflects the impact of a once in a lifetime reassessment of the nation’s housing needs in the wake of the 50+ day lockdown. Homeowners and renters are reconsidering their housing requirements, characterised by a search for more space and changing expectations for work and commuting patterns.”
Zoopla expects this to continue well into the fourth quarter. Prices are still – for the moment – rising in almost all parts of the country. That means there’s no brake on supply from sellers trapped by negative equity, and lessens the fear of trying to sell into what, in view of the economic situation,  ought to be a weak market.
A golden opportunity, then, for estate agents (as the Brits call realtors), whose business depends more on transaction volumes than on prices paid. But the market appears to be slow in coming round to the idea.
Yes, estate agents’ share prices have outperformed the more actively traded housebuilder stocks in the last month, but for the year-to-date, it’s a very different picture.  Foxtons  (LON:FOXT) and Countrywide (LON:CWD), two of the best-known agent names, are still down over 55%.
Countrywide has also been hampered by trouble selling its commercial property arm, and structural shifts to online platforms and the sudden stop in business in March have punished pre-existing balance sheet weakness. But even online specialist Purplebricks (LON:PURP) has hardly fared better, losing 30%.
For pure online plays, Purplebricks and  Onthemarket  (LON:OTMPO) are the only two alternatives to Rightmove (OTC:RTMVY), whose 5 billion-pound price tag is more than 15 times their combined market value. In recent weeks, there have been signs that both are starting to lure independent agents away from Rightmove with advertising terms. Purplebricks is up 84% this month, and gained another 5.4% on the back of the Zoopla report. Rightmove gained 0.4% and has risen 11.6% in the same period. The U.K. FTSE 250 midcap index, meanwhile, slipped 0.1% by mid-morning, having risen 2.6% over the last month."

(Reuters) - A cautious mood prevailed in European equity markets on Thursday as investors looked ahead to the U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's outlook on monetary policy.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index (STOXX) slipped 0.3%, with banks (SX7P) being the biggest drags after HSBC (L:HSBA) fell 2.2%. The British bank came under fresh U.S. criticism on Wednesday for its reported treatment of customers linked with the pro-democracy movement in Hong Kong.
Tech stocks (SX8P) extended gains after another record-setting session on Wall Street. (N) 
Investors will be looking for clues on the U.S. central bank's new strategy for meeting its price stability and maximum employment goals amid a deep economic crisis caused by the coronavirus pandemic. Powell is set to speak at 1310 GMT.
""It's hard to imagine Powell's going to say much more that is particularly supportive,"" said Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG. ""It's going to be a speech that perhaps marks a high-water mark for risk in the short term.""
European Central Bank chief economist Philip Lane is also scheduled to speak at the virtual Jackson Hole meeting.
Germany's exporter-heavy DAX (GDAXI) posted minimal losses as data showed profit at China's industrial firms grew for a third straight month in July and at the fastest pace since June 2018.
The auto sector (SXAP), up 0.7%, was among the few gainers. 
Barring the German manufacturing sector, recent data has pointed to the plateauing of an economic recovery in the euro zone as several countries see a resurgence in coronavirus cases. 
A Reuters poll of fund managers showed European stocks are expected to stall for the rest of 2020 and miss out on the bull market, which has propelled Wall Street to record highs. 
WPP (L:WPP), the world's biggest advertising company, jumped 4.7% as it resumed its dividend after cost cuts and a switch to faster ad production helped it to beat dire forecasts for second-quarter trading.
Smaller rival Publicis (PA:PUBP) rose 1.2%.
German online takeaway food group Delivery Hero (DE:DHER) slipped 1.4% after announcing the acquisition of online grocery service InstaShop.
French conglomerate  Bouygues  (PA:BOUY) rose 3.2% after reporting a lower-than-expected core operating loss in the first half of the year.

LONDON (Reuters) - Sovereign wealth funds poured a net $7.1 billion into stocks during the second quarter, the most in several years, with the bulk outside the United States, data showed on Thursday.
The funds also pulled a net $5.2 billion out of fixed income during that period, the most since the first quarter of 2019, according to the eVestment data on strategies managed by third-party fund managers.
Global large-cap growth equity strategies took in the most investment during the quarter, a net $6 billion. U.S. equity strategies pulled in only a net $704 million during that time.

""We're seeing the sovereign wealth funds doing quite a lot of active search activity now in international equities, equities excluding U.S.,"" said Matthew Williams (NYSE:WMB), head of institutional sales in Europe, the Middle East and Africa at Franklin Templeton.
""There is usually an increased allocation to equities as a hedging mechanism, given the historical negative correlation between equities and oil prices, and I think that's evident in what the oil-dependent sovereign wealth funds have been doing.""
Aversion to U.S. stocks might be due to valuations as price-to-earning ratios run at around 29 times amid the S&P 500's push to fresh highs, as well as uncertainty about the outcome of the U.S. election in November, said Williams.
""Institutional allocators are keeping some of their powder dry on the U.S. equity allocations at the moment,"" he said.
Stock investments in public and private markets have contributed to the proportion of sovereign funds' direct listed deals compared with unlisted ones reaching 50% so far in 2020, the highest level since at least 2014, according to International Forum of Sovereign Wealth Funds (IFSWF) data.
""We have seen more direct investments in public markets and this was partly skewed by large investments Saudi Arabia's PIF (Public Investment Fund) has made in U.S. equity markets in Q1 and they've since sold some holdings, which may explain some of the outflows in the data,"" said Enrico Soddu, IFSWF's head of data and analytics.

733,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 27, 2020 04:18AM ET</span>",Russian Diamond Giant Follows De Beers With Price Cuts,"(Bloomberg) -- Russian diamond miner Alrosa (MCX:ALRS) joined rival De Beers in cutting prices for its gems, but with a twist -- the company changed its billing system so buyers can’t tell which stones are discounted, or by how much.
The two biggest producers for months refused to cut prices even as sales collapsed during the coronavirus pandemic, to avoid giving up too much ground before demand returned. De Beers and Alrosa don’t publish prices for their rough stones and their dominance in the often-secretive diamond industry has allowed the two companies to dictate terms to their customers over the years.
In a sign the miners see demand returning, De Beers cut prices by almost 10% for larger stones earlier this week. Alrosa’s buyers also lowered prices in the most recent sale, according to people familiar with the situation. However, instead of the usual individually priced diamond parcels, the company issued a single invoice total for each customer, the people said. Alrosa didn’t explain the change, they said.
Read more: The Masters of the Diamond World Are Losing Control
The two biggest producers have traditionally sought to keep any price cuts private to avoid ripple effects through the supply chain. For example, polished-diamond buyers like jewelry retailers could use the information to seek lower prices from De Beers and Alrosa’s customers.
“We avoided speculative trading during the worst phase of the crisis, keeping ‘price over volume strategy’ intact. We believe it is the only viable strategy to protect the value of the stones in the market conditions our industry faced recently,” said Evgeny Agureev, Alrosa’s head of sales. “As demand for the rough diamonds starts to recover, we make sure that prices under our long-term contracts reflect the actual market trends and a confirmed real demand.”
The decision to cut prices is the latest in a string of concessions to normal sales rules by the two diamond giants during the health crisis. They’ve already allowed customers to renege on contracts and view diamonds in alternative locations. Still, smaller rivals were selling at a 25% discount, eating into the companies’ market share.
An increase in demand for rough diamonds may be inevitable after most big cutters and polishers hardly bought any stones since February and their inventories are running low. However, a sustained recovery of the industry will depend on consumers returning to jewelry stores. While demand has improved in China, the U.S. will be key as it accounts for nearly half of all sales.

LONDON (Reuters) - European shares opened lower on Thursday and the dollar was slightly higher, as investors focused on the U.S. Federal Reserve Chair's speech at the virtual Jackson Hole conference later in the session.
Wall Street hit new record highs on Wednesday and the MSCI world share index also rose to its highest ever, with the endless supply of cheap cash from central banks pushing up big-cap tech companies.
But the rally petered out in the Asian session, with an element of caution coming from the United States sanctioning China over military action in the disputed South China Sea.
The MSCI world equity index (MIWD00000PUS), which tracks shares in 49 countries, was broadly flat on the day at 0723 GMT, while the MSCI's main European Index <.MSER> was down 0.1%.
The pan-European STOXX 600 was down 0.1%, but still close to two-week highs (STOXX).
Market focus is now squarely on the virtual Jackson Hole conference, where Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is expected to drop policy hints when he speaks at 0910 EDT (1310 GMT).
""While we expect the Fed to shy away from more radical easing measures, such as explicit controls on government bond yields, we believe Powell will likely outline other dovish measures,"" Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Manager, wrote in a note to clients.
""These could include a move toward average inflation targeting, giving the central bank more leeway to allow inflation to overshoot the 2% target while keeping rates pegged close to zero,"" he said.
The Fed has already cut interest rates to zero, started bond-buying and approved a massive lending programme.
Its balance sheet has expanded by as much as $3 trillion since the start of the pandemic - far more than that of the European Central Bank and Bank of Japan.
The dollar ticked up after two consecutive days of falling. Against a basket of currencies, it was up 0.1% at 92.955 (=USD).
The riskier Aussie  and Kiwi dollars  gained versus the U.S. dollar, while the euro was slightly lower at $1.1823 (EUR=EBS).
Australia's Victoria state — epicentre of the nation's second wave of COVID-19 infections — reported its lowest one-day rise in new cases in nearly two months.
The offshore Chinese yuan  hit a 7-month high versus the dollar, with the market apparently undeterred by the rising tensions between China and the United States.
European bond yields fell, with Germany's benchmark 10-year Bund yield at -0.438% (DE10YT=RR).
Oil prices were mixed, with Brent crude (LCOc1) futures for October, which expire on Friday, up 0.2% at $45.73 a barrel by 0742 GMT. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude (CLc1) futures were down 0.1% at $43.34 a barrel.
Hurricane Laura, a massive hurricane in the Gulf of Mexico, has pushed the market higher this week, but the storm is not expected to affect supplies much because oil and product inventories are high.
Gold prices fell as investors took profits before Powell's speech, with spot gold down 0.5% to $1,944.55 per ounce by 0745 GMT.
Also in focus is the Republican National Convention. U.S. President Donald Trump will speak live from the White House on Thursday.

(Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) on Thursday said it is opening a supermarket in Los Angeles with shopping carts that let customers skip checkout lines, as the e-commerce company builds out its offline presence.
The market, in the Woodland Hills neighborhood, is called the Amazon Fresh grocery store. It is the first location to let customers in - by invitation only - out of seven that Amazon has confirmed for Southern California and greater Chicago. The Woodland Hills site will open to the wider public in coming weeks, Amazon said.
The world's largest online retailer has experimented with physical stores in recent years to capture more consumer spending, particularly in groceries. It has more than 20 cashier-less shops with grab-and-go food for office workers and over 500 stores in the Whole Foods Market chain it acquired in 2017.
Amazon's latest concept faces stiff competition from far larger incumbents Kroger (NYSE:KR) Co and Albertsons Companies Inc.
It is roughly the size of a Whole Foods store at 35,000 square feet (3,252 square meters) but serves a different need, not focused on natural and organic items, said Amazon Vice President Jeff Helbling.
""We feature a lot of national brands,"" he said in an interview. Prices are ""lower than the other options that the people have in the Woodland Hills area."" 
The store will be the first with the ""Amazon Dash Cart."" This lets shoppers filling up to two grocery bags forgo the store's cashiers via technology systems that discern what they put in the cart and bill a credit card on file once customers leave through a designated lane.
The shop also has a counter for picking up and returning web orders, and stations for questioning Amazon's voice-controlled assistant Alexa about the store.

Amazon last month posted its biggest quarterly profit ever due to online sales during the coronavirus pandemic, but a 13% drop in physical store revenue.

Investing.com - European stock markets drifted Thursday, with Rolls-Royce (OTC:RYCEY) Holdings (LON:RR) slumping, ahead of a key speech from Jerome Powell, the head of the U.S. Federal Reserve.
At 3:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.1% higher, the CAC 40 in France fell 0.2% and the U.K.'s FTSE index was down 0.2%.
Losses have been minor Thursday with most investors wary ahead of the Jackson Hole symposium, to be held virtually later Thursday, where U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell is expected to deliver a pivotal speech setting out the central bank's new strategy for meeting its price stability and maximum employment goals. 
“If it goes the way most people are anticipating, with a move to allow inflation to overshoot the 2% target to achieve 2% on average, rather than as a spot target, then it would imply looser monetary policy and higher future inflation,” said ING’s Robert Carnell, in a research note.
Turning back to Europe, French business confidence rebounded in August to its highest since the country went into a coronavirus lockdown, a survey showed on Thursday.
In corporate news, Rolls-Royce stock dropped 7.3% after the U.K. engineering company reported a large pretax loss for the first half of the year, and couldn’t recommend a dividend.
On the flip side, advertising group WPP (LON:WPP) rose 5.4% after it resumed paying a dividend after cost cuts helped it to beat dire forecasts for second-quarter trading.
 Bouygues  (PA:BOUY) climbed 2.9% despite the French construction and media conglomerate reporting a net loss for the first half of 2020. It expects significant profitability in the second half of the year.
Oil prices were stable Thursday as Hurricane Laura made landfall, threatening to devastate the U.S. Gulf Coast, an area with nearly half of America’s refining capacity.
The prospect of a powerful hurricane is having a smaller impact on the market than would have been expected in the past: inventories remain high as a result of the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on fuel demand in the first half
U.S. oil inventories stood at 507.8 million barrels at the end of the week to Aug. 21, even after the Energy Information Administration reported a larger-than-expected drop of 4.7 million barrels.
U.S. crude futures traded 0.1% higher at $43.42 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract rose 0.3% to $46.29.

With the Federal Reserve poised to adopt a policy that could suppress rates for years to come, Caron is adding higher-yielding debt including from emerging markets to Morgan Stanley’s global fixed-income funds.
“They want to make riskier assets even more appealing,” said Caron, whose team at Morgan Stanley Investment Management in New York oversees $665 billion. “That will help high-yield, asset-backed securities, emerging market debt and equities.”
Under the new Fed approach, policy makers may tolerate a run-up in consumer prices above their 2% target before tightening policy. For markets, the big takeaway is the prospect of zero rates for five years or even longer.

On the flip side, the prospect of hotter inflation is stoking demand for hedges such as gold and CPI-indexed bonds. Longer-dated debt in particular is sensitive to changes in consumer-price expectations.
Caron thinks that concern is overblown. “They’re doing quantitative easing at the same time as likely adjusting rate policy, so they won’t be allowing bond yields to rise much,” he said. “The Fed is still keeping the 30-year yield at a very low level with QE.”
The Morgan Stanley veteran doesn’t foresee the central bank endorsing negative short-term interest rates or yield curve control, at least any time soon.
Fed Chairman Jerome Powell is slated to provide an update on the Fed’s framework when he speaks on Thursday to the central bank’s Jackson Hole conference, being held virtually this year because of the coronavirus pandemic. The changes could be unveiled as soon as next month.
“They only other outcome from all of this is you’ll see the dollar weakening,” Caron said.

740,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 27, 2020 03:15AM ET</span>",Honda goes small with first all-electric car,"By Maki Shiraki
UTSUNOMIYA, Japan (Reuters) - As many automakers bet on sedans and SUVs in the switch to electric vehicles (EV), Japan's Honda Motor Co Ltd (T:7267) has decided smaller is better for its first-ever all-battery car.
The Honda e, released in Europe earlier this month, is a compact model meant solely for city driving. That contrasts with Tesla Inc (O:TSLA), whose Model 3 sedan dominates the battery EV market, and others such as  Audi AG  (DE:NSUG) and Hyundai Motor Co (O:TSLA) that have focused on SUVs with long driving ranges.
High battery costs have kept EVs at the premium end of the car market, and many automakers are developing bigger, all-purpose models, some of which can drive as far as 570 kilometres on a single charge. 
The Honda e, however, has a battery capacity roughly half that of the Model 3, driving just 280 kilometres per charge. 
""Most EVs use large capacity batteries, but often, much of that capacity goes unused during city driving,"" said Tomofumi Ichinose, chief engineer of the Honda e, told reporters earlier this week.
""We question whether larger vehicles are appropriate for urban areas, and believe that smaller is a better option for cities."" 
With a retro, ultra-compact design evoking Honda's classic N360 and N600 models from the 1960s, the two-door Honda e is intended as an upmarket city car, whose price tag of around 33,000 euros ($39,000) is higher than  Renault  (PA:RENA)'s Zoe ZE50, which is roomier and has a longer driving range.
Ichinose said Honda engineers had prioritised accurate and sharp handling to enable easy u-turns in narrow streets. Side mirrors have been replaced with interior displays to avoid bumps and scrapes during parking.
The model will only be sold in Europe and Japan, where it goes on sale in late October. Honda expects annual sales of only around 10,000 in Europe, and 1,000 at home, where it will also introduce the model into its car-sharing fleet.

The automaker said it had no plans to market the car in North America or China, its biggest markets where SUVs dominate.

Investing.com - European stock markets are set to open lower Thursday amid further tension between the U.S. and China, although losses are likely to be limited ahead of a key speech from Jerome Powell, the head of the U.S. Federal Reserve.
At 2:05 AM ET (0605 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.4% lower, the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. fell 0.1%, while CAC 40 futures in France was flat.
Relations between the globe’s two economic superpowers were tested again Wednesday, with China firing four medium-range ballistic missiles into the disputed South China sea during military exercises, while Washington placed sanctions on a further 24 Chinese companies.
Investors had been buoyed earlier in the week on the hope of a thawing of the frosty relationship between the two countries as senior officials had discussed the progress, or lack of it, in implementing phase one of the trade agreement signed in January.
However, most eyes will be on the Jackson Hole symposium, held virtually later Thursday, where U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell is expected to deliver a pivotal speech setting out the central bank's new strategy for meeting its price stability and maximum employment goals. 
“If it goes the way most people are anticipating, with a move to allow inflation to overshoot the 2% target to achieve 2% on average, rather than as a spot target, then it would imply looser monetary policy and higher future inflation, higher longer-term bond yields, a slightly stronger USD and a steeper yield curve,” said ING’s Robert Carnell, in a research note.
Turning back to Europe,  Bouygues  (PA:BOUY) is likely to be in focus as the French construction and media conglomerate reported a net loss for the first half of 2020, with sales dropping due to a slowdown in activity and lockdown policies to contain the spread of coronavirus.
Oil prices edged higher  Thursday, with the market nervously monitoring Hurricane Laura’s progress towards Texas and Louisiana given nearly half of America’s refining capacity is located in the region, and over 13% of national refining capacity is already shut in.
Producers have already shut down 1.56 million barrels per day of crude output, as well as evacuating 310 offshore facilities. 
The prospect of a powerful hurricane is having a smaller impact on the market than would have been expected in the past: inventories remain high as a result of the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on fuel demand in the first half
U.S. crude inventories stood at 507.8 million barrels at the end of the week to Aug. 21, even after the Energy Information Administration reported a larger-than-expected drop of 4.7 million barrels.
U.S. crude futures traded 0.1% higher at $43.42 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract rose 0.2% to $46.27. 
Elsewhere, gold futures fell 0.2% to $1,947.80/oz, while EUR/USD traded flat at 1.1829."

The exchange pointed to network connectivity issues from the cyber attacks and said it is hoping to resume on Friday. 
""This decision not to re-open has been made while we focus on addressing the situation,"" the bourse said in a statement.
The cyber attacks on Tuesday and Wednesday targeted the exchange's network provider through a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack, which is a common way to disrupt a server by overwhelming it with a flood of internet traffic.
The bourse took the call to not reopen the main board, NZX debt market and Fonterra Shareholders Market after trading was halted at 11:10 AM local time (2310 GMT). NZX will also close the derivatives market on Thursday.
""We continue to address the threat and work with cybersecurity experts and we are doing everything we can to resume normal trading tomorrow,"" NZX said.

The United States has long complained of lack of access to audit working papers for U.S.-listed Chinese companies. Washington earlier this months threatened measures to delist Chinese firms that fail to meet its auditing requirements.
Fang Xinghai, vice chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), told Bloomberg that CSRC this month sent the U.S. Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) a fresh proposal that would allow the U.S. to pick any of its SOEs for a trial joint inspection.
A previous trial inspection done jointly by Chinese and U.S. regulators failed to yield an agreement, the article said.
Fang also called for direct talks with U.S. officials, but an offer for a video or phone meeting has yet to get a response, it said.
Fang didn't immediately reply a request for comment.
Fang's remarks echoed an Aug. 8 statement by CSRC in response to delisting calls from the Trump Administration.

In that statement, CSRC said it has been proposing joint accounting inspections with U.S. regulators with a show of ""total sincerity towards cooperation"". CSRC also said solving the issue through dialogue is the only way toward ""win-win"" situation.

Investing.com – Asian stocks were mostly down on Thursday morning, with mounting tensions between the U.S. and China overshadowing the rally in U.S. markets during the previous session.
Tensions between the two countries flared up after China fired four medium-range ballistic missiles into the disputed South China sea on Wednesday, part of broader military exercises being conducted by the People’s Liberation Army. In a separate move on the same day, the U.S. slapped sanctions on a further 24 companies to penalize their efforts to help China “reclaim and militarize disputed outposts” in the waterway.
China called for direct talks to iron out the disputes, with China Securities Regulatory Commission Vice Chairman Fang Xinghai reportedly requesting an online or phone meeting with U.S. officials. The U.S. is yet to respond to Fang’s request.
China’s Shanghai Composite edged up 0.12% by 10:46 PM ET (3:46 AM GMT) while the Shenzhen Component was down 0.51%.
The National Bureau of Statistics said earlier in the day that profits at Chinese industrial firms grew 19.6% year-on-year in July. Profits grew 11.50% year-on-year in June.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index fell 0.88% and Japan’s Nikkei 225 was down 0.44%.
South Korea’s KOSPI fell 0.59%, with the country reporting a record 441 COVID-19 cases on Wednesday. The Bank of Korea also slashed its growth forecast to 1.3% from the 0.2% contraction that it forecast in May, as well as holding its seven-day repurchase rate at 0.5%, a record low.
Down Under, the ASX 200 was up 0.46%.
Meanwhile, all eyes are on U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, who is due to speak at the Jackson Hole symposium later in the day.
Investors are hoping that Powell’s speech will provide clearer guidance on the U.S. economic recovery from COVID-19.
“Markets are now turning bullishly focused on U.S. Fed Chair Powell’s speech at Jackson Hole, which is expected to be a very market-friendly delivery,” AxiCorp chief global markets strategist Stephen Innes told Bloomberg.
“After all, I do not think anyone is willing to bet against the Fed finding a way to sound overtly dovish, especially during this pandemic induced easing cycle.”"

Some employees at Samsung's mobile phone and consumer electronics divisions are eligible to apply for the programme, which is aimed at assessing whether to adopt work-from-home more widely, and if so, how to do so, the official said.
South Korea reported 441 new COVID-19 cases as of Wednesday, the highest number of daily infections since early March, with most cases occurring in the Seoul metropolitan area, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Thursday.
Samsung has seen a series of novel coronavirus cases involving its workers at its sites in or near Seoul in recent weeks.
Earlier this week, an employee at Samsung's mobile division tested positive for the coronavirus, forcing the company to temporarily close one of its buildings at its headquarters in the city of Suwon, south of Seoul.

Samsung, which makes chips, displays, smartphones and other devices in South Korea, said production has not been affected by the coronavirus resurgence.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Chinese electric vehicle (EV) maker Xpeng (N:XPEV) has increased the size of its U.S initial public offering (IPO) to about $1.49 billion, two sources with direct knowledge of the matter said.
The company will price its shares at $15 each, the sources said, after initially indicating they would be sold for $11 to $13 when the deal was launched on Friday.
Xpeng, which counts Chinese e-commerce titan  Alibaba  (N:BABA) among its backers, had initially targeted raising $1.11 billion. 
It had planned to sell 85 million American Depository Shares (ADS) but increased that to about 99.7 million shares following higher-than-expected demand from investors, the sources said on condition of anonymity as the information is not yet public.
Xpeng declined to comment.
Based on the new size of the deal, Xpeng would be valued at around $11.2 billion following its IPO. Its shares will start trading in New York on Thursday.

There is also a so-called greenshoe option in which another 14.96 million shares can be issued within the next 30 days that would allow Xpeng to raise a further $224.4 million.

An online shopping boom triggered by the coronavirus outbreak has supported growth in the BNPL sector and helped to turn Afterpay into one of Australia's 20 most valuable stocks.
In a volatile first hour of trade, Afterpay shares climbed nearly 6% to a record A$95.97, but quickly reversed course to be 5% down at 0100 GMT while the broader market was marginally higher.
The quarter to June was Afterpay's best in terms of the amount of sales it processed, and underlying sales in fiscal 2020 doubled from last year to A$11.10 billion ($8.04 billion).
Afterpay, which offers small interest-free instalment loans to shoppers and makes money by charging merchants a commission, said it will buy a Singapore-based BNPL, EmpatKali, which operates in Indonesia, that would help it drive into Asia. 
It also launched into Canada.
This follows its European expansion plans announced on Monday, which would see the Afterpay enter Spain, France, Italy and possibly Portugal with regulatory approvals in place.
The Tencent-backed (HK:0700) firm said active customers more than doubled to 9.9 million at year-end.
In the United States, active customers more than tripled during the year, while underlying sales in the country jumped to A$4 billion from A$900 million a year earlier.
The United States has become the fastest-growing BNPL market and accounts for more than half of the company's customers and more than a third of underlying sales.
Afterpay reported a loss of A$22.9 million for the year ended June 30, compared with a loss of A$43.8 million a year earlier.
Core earnings jumped 73% to A$44.4 million, in line with the company's own hiked forecast last week.

749,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 26, 2020 08:20PM ET</span>",Gravity-defying global stock markets to end 2020 below pre-COVID highs: Reuters Poll,"By Rahul Karunakar
BENGALURU (Reuters) - Global stock markets are forecast to close the year below their pre-pandemic highs, but will still keep alive for at least another six months a bull run that is defying a sombre economic outlook across much of the world, Reuters polls of market experts found.
Share prices have surged as much as 57% since hitting a bottom in late March, as traders and investors quickly switched their focus from what is sure to be the deepest economic recession on record to how swiftly the world may recover.
But all the 17 indexes in Reuters polls of over 200 equity strategists across Asia, Europe and the Americas taken Aug 12-25 were forecast to end 2020 below their pre-COVID-19 highs. Fifteen were seen ending the year lower than their 2019 close.
While the latest findings were slightly more upbeat than those taken three months ago, the outlook for stock markets from Asia to Europe to Americas has limited upside, if any, on weak corporate earnings and economic worries.
That suggests further gains will be harder to come by.
""Equity markets rebounded ... (but) as this higher starting point represents a mismatch between equity prices and fundamentals, we expect this divergence to be gradually reflected in prices,"" noted Monica Defend, global head of research at Amundi Asset Management.
""Aided by the still-ongoing recovery of the equity market, ex-ante returns for equity overall are set to peak in the medium term, losing steam thereafter. We maintain that the subsequent recovery (in stocks) will not happen immediately, with spurts of relief rallies not quite reaching pre-pandemic levels.""
Awash with historic amounts of monetary and fiscal stimulus, 14 of 17 indexes were forecast to rise from here by year-end, with nearly 60% of about 110 strategists who had a view predicting at least another six months of the current bull run.
""Our view that equity prices will rise further is underpinned by our forecast that the global economy will continue to recover, even if more slowly and unevenly than during its initial bounce-back over the past few months, and that ample policy support will remain in place for as long as it is needed,"" said Simona Gambarini, markets economist at Capital Economics.
Asked about the likelihood of a significant correction in stock markets in the next three months, respondents were split, with 67 of 128 strategists predicting it be ""unlikely"" or ""very unlikely"" despite lofty valuations after the recent rally. The rest said ""likely"" or ""very likely"".
In response to a separate question, there was no clear view on what would be the primary driver of stock markets for the rest of the year.
(Graphic: Reuters Poll - Global stock market outlook https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/polling/gjnpwaxjqpw/Global%20stock%20market%20outlook.PNG)
Despite the disconnect between U.S. share prices and the economy, where unemployment has risen sharply as many states are still struggling to suppress the virus, the S&P 500 wiped out all of its 35% loss and swiftly returned to a record high.
But that latest run-up on Wall Street is concentrated among a handful of very large technology companies. 
In the United States, the so-called FAANG stocks - Facebook (O:FB), Amazon.com (O:AMZN), Apple (O:AAPL), Netflix (O:NFLX) and Google-parent Alphabet (O:GOOGL) have led the technology and consumer discretionary sectors back to record highs.
Apple has been a star performer among FAANG stocks, with its market value swelling to $2.15 trillion - greater than all the components in the benchmark London FTSE 100 (FTSE) index.
Forecasts from Refinitiv I/B/E/S data show analysts expect a 20% decline in earnings for S&P 500 companies for 2020, with the second quarter still seen as the low point for this year.
""Anchoring investment views to the past is becoming less relevant, in our view, as structural trends such as rising inequality, deglobalization, the policy revolution and sustainability race toward us,"" noted portfolio strategists at BlackRock (NYSE:BLK).

(Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said on Wednesday it approved a proposal by the New York Stock Exchange to allow companies to raise capital through direct listings.
The move is a major breakthrough for the exchange operator that has been pushing for an alternative to traditional initial public offerings (IPOs) for companies to raise money. 
It will widen the options available to private companies that are looking to go public, but are wary of the role played by investment banks in the IPO process.
""We are not trying to displace the IPO. We are trying to create more options for companies and investors seeking to tap into the public markets,"" NYSE Vice Chairman and Chief Commercial Officer John Tuttle said in a telephone interview.
The latest development comes at a time when U.S. capital markets are in the middle of an extended resurgence after the COVID-19 pandemic delayed IPOs earlier this year.
Peter Thiel-backed Palantir Technologies and Asana are some of the high-profile private startups to choose the direct listing route this year. 
Prior to Wednesday's ruling, the SEC allowed direct listings for companies that did not raise capital in the process. In 2018, music streaming business  Spotify Technology  SA (N:SPOT) was the first major company to go public through the route.
The NYSE submitted amended proposals in June to allow companies to raise capital through direct listings after the SEC declined similar requests by the exchange operator in December.
In its ruling on Wednesday, the SEC said it believed the changes proposed by the NYSE were consistent with its rules and regulations.
Reuters reported earlier this week that exchange operator Nasdaq Inc (O:NDAQ) has also filed with regulators for a similar change to its rules.

Prominent venture capitalist Bill Gurley, who has openly criticized the traditional IPO structure, welcomed the ruling on Twitter on Wednesday. (https://

SAO PAULO/RIO (Reuters) - Brazil's Petroleo Brasileiro SA (SA:PETR4) is set to receive binding offers on Thursday for its Presidente Getulio Vargas refinery, with local firms Raizen and Ultrapar Participacoes SA (SA:UGPA3) among the likely bidders, sources familiar with the matter said.
The sale is part of a multi-billion plan by the state-controlled oil company, known as Petrobras, to divest assets, with interest from ethanol and fuel distribution company Raizen and conglomerate Ultrapar powered by deep-pocketed foreign investment firms.
Based in the southern Brazilian state of Parana, Repar is Brazil's fifth-largest refinery, able to process 208,000 barrels per day, representing 9% of the country's capacity. It supplies the states of Parana, Santa Catarina, Sao Paulo and Mato Grosso, making it a good fit for both Ultra and Raizen, which have fuel distribution businesses in these areas.
Raizen, a joint venture between Royal Dutch Shell Plc (L:RDSa) and Brazilian ethanol producer Cosan SA (SA:CSAN3), is teaming up with U.S.-based private equity firm Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP) to bid for various Petrobras refineries, Reuters reported in January. GIP has more than $50 billion in assets under management.
Raizen declined to comment. Petrobras didn't immediately reply to a request for comment.
Ultrapar could look to buy the refinery on its own or in a joint bid with Patria Investimentos Ltda, an investment fund backed by Blackstone Group Inc (N:BX), which reached a 5% stake in the company in June, according to one source familiar with Ultrapar's deliberations. 
Ultrapar didn't immediately reply to a request for comment. Patria declined to comment.
Another source said Petrobras was expecting additional offers for Repar, without naming potential bidders. 
Indian conglomerate Essar Group had considered a bid in recent months, but it was not clear if the company would follow through, another source said. Essar didn't immediately reply to a request for comment sent outside regular market hours in India. 
The Parana unit is the second of a group of refineries that Petrobras is putting on the block as part of government efforts to bring more competition to the sector. Petrobras is in talks with Abu Dhabi investment firm Mubadala about finalizing an offer for the first refinery put up for sale, Rlam, in the northeastern state of Bahia.
Repar produces mostly gasoline and diesel, up to 70%, combined, as well as asphalt base, aviation fuel and butane gas. The unit is being sold with five storage terminals, one in Parana state and four in Santa Catarina, and 476 kilometers (295 miles) of oil pipelines.

The carrier posted a net loss after tax of NZ$454 million ($300 million) for the year ended June 30, down from a NZ$276 million profit a year earlier. While unable to provide specific earnings guidance, it said current modeling suggests it will make another loss in 2021. The Auckland-based airline, which traditionally generates two thirds of its revenue from international travel, doesn’t expect passenger demand to return to 2019 levels until 2023 or beyond.
“Until global borders reopen, we will continue to be significantly impacted by this crisis,” Chief Executive Officer Greg Foran said. “The unfortunate reality is that we don’t expect to see a return to long-haul travel for some time and until then we will be a keenly focused domestic airline.”
Airlines around the world are reeling from the impact of the pandemic on global travel, forcing them to review fleets, routes and spending and turn to governments for help. Air New Zealand has laid off about 4,000 staff and grounded some aircraft, while domestic services have been hampered by a second lockdown in largest city Auckland after a new Covid-19 outbreak there.
“The unfortunate reality is that some airlines will not survive this,” Foran said. “The actions we have taken to date, albeit painful, are with a view to setting ourselves up for success in whatever competitive and demand environment emerges on the other side of this crisis.”
Operating revenue sank 16% to NZ$4.84 billion as total network capacity declined 21% from a year earlier. Cargo revenue was a bright spot, rising 15% to NZ$449 million.
Air New Zealand said it has yet to draw upon a NZ$900 million loan facility provided by the government, which is a 52% shareholder.
“The airline continues to assess its capital structure and the longer term options available,” it said. “The government has recently reaffirmed its commitment to maintaining its majority shareholding, and the board is engaging constructively with the Crown in its capital structure and funding discussions.”

755,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 26, 2020 04:40PM ET</span>",Facebook says Apple's new privacy rules could spare its own apps but hit smaller companies,"By Stephen Nellis, Katie Paul and Paresh Dave
(Reuters) -  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) on Wednesday warned that privacy changes coming from Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) could hurt smaller developers such as gaming companies disproportionately but will likely leave its own apps mostly unscathed.
In a blog post, Facebook said it was making a change to its own apps - which in addition to its flagship app also include WhatsApp and Instagram - that would likely spare them from having to ask iPhone users for data-tracking permissions that many advertising industry insiders believe users will refuse.
Facebook shares surged 8.2% on Wednesday to close at $303.91, a record high for a second straight day. 
In a blog post, Facebook said it was also making changes that could hurt smaller developers that use a Facebook tool for serving apps in third-party apps. The changes come ahead of Apple's new rules, which require increased user notifications for ad tracking and will take effect when new iPhones arrive this fall.
Facebook said it was considering discontinuing on iPhones a tool called Audience Network, which thousands of developers put into their apps to serve ads. Facebook collects data about users from the apps where it serves those ads, which it uses to inform highly tailored targeting throughout its business.
""Apple's updates may render Audience Network so ineffective on iOS 14 that it may not make sense to offer it on iOS 14,"" Facebook said in a blog post https:// (https:// The Audience Network business, while an important source of revenue and traffic to small developers such as gaming companies, is far from Facebook's biggest business, said Brian Wieser, global president of business intelligence at GroupM. ""It would surprise me if it was greater than $1 billion on a net basis,"" he said. Apple previously provided a tool called the identifier for advertisers, or IDFA, that allowed Facebook and others to engage in such tracking of users across apps.  But in June, the iPhone maker said such activity will require a pop-up notification saying the app ""would like permission to track you across apps and websites owned by other companies."" Digital advertising firms expect most users will decline to grant that permission. ""Apple is saying, we had an 'opt out' system before, and we're going to switch to an 'opt in' system,"" said Craig Danuloff, chief executive of The Privacy Co, which makes an app to help users assess how private their data is.  ""What do advertisers say? They immediately assume it's Armageddon. They just know nobody really wants this."" As an alternative to the tracking tools it previously provided advertisers, Apple created a new advertising network technology that was better for privacy protection of users.  Facebook on Wednesday said it would stop using Apple's older tracking tools in its own apps and adopt Apple's new offering, though it said Apple's new technology ""limits the data available to businesses for running and measuring campaigns."" The changes Facebook announced Wednesday will fall hardest on ads that prompt users to install new mobile apps, a format that is heavily used in the video game industry. ""Apple's iOS 14 changes will certainly negatively affect the way that game studios and publishers currently raise revenue and gain users through sales targeted advertisements,"" Renee Gittins, executive director of the International Game Developers Association, said in a statement. John Nardone, chief executive of ad serving software company Flashtalking, said Apple's move to restrict its ad business could be viewed as anti-competitive by raising prices for consumers used to free, ad-supported apps. ""There's self-interest in Apple doing this because as the advertising revenue stream becomes more difficult, then apps have to charge users and Apple, as you know from the Epic Games case, takes 30% of that,"" Nardone said. ""Apple doesn't have a stake in ads but they have a stake in paid apps."" For publishers the burden may be less, said David Chavern, president of the News Media Alliance, which represents several major U.S. publishers.  Many rely on what is known as first-party data, such as which stories a user reads, to determine which ads to show, an activity which is not subject to Apple's new rules.  
""News publishers aren't huge beneficiaries of cross-app tracking and, more broadly, we all see the ecosystem moving against highly targeted programmatic ads,"" he said. ""There may end up being benefits to publishers from that, such as a some move back to contextual advertising.""

Investing.com – The S&P 500 and Nasdaq hit record highs, as gains in FAANG stocks and an earnings-led surge by Salesforce.com prompted investors to raise their bullish bets on stocks. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.30%, or 83 points. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite rose 1.03% and 1.73% to hit record highs. 
Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) stole the show, with the latter more than 11% higher as investors bet that tech will continue to reign supreme. 
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) was upgraded by Wedbush to a street-high $600 from $515 on signs of increasing demand for its upcoming slate of 5G-enabled iPhones due later this year.
Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) was up 6% despite warning that changes Apple made to its latest iPhone operating system could impair the social media giant's ability to roll-out in-app advertisements to iPhone users, potentially cutting revenue in its audience network advertising business by more than 50%.
Better-than-expected earnings in tech also lifted sentiment as Salesforce.com Inc (NYSE:CRM) and  Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co  (NYSE:HPE) reported better-than-expected results late Tuesday.
Salesforce.com surged 26% after raising guidance and reporting blowout quarterly earnings of $1.44 per share, well above the 67 cents a share consensus estimate, led by growth in remote work and e-commerce.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise reported better-than-expected earnings of 32 cents per share and revenue of 6.82 billion, sending its shares more than 3% higher.
Investor sentiment on stocks was also helped by further positive news on a potential coronavirus vaccine.
Drugmaker  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) reported that its coronavirus vaccine candidate, mRNA-1273, has shown positive results in a trial of patients aged 56 and older. Its share price climbed by more than 6%.
Positive vaccine news comes as the spread of the virus across the U.S. continues to abate.
Since the beginning of August, weekly average daily cases in the U.S. fell to about 40,000 from over 60,000 new infections, with daily cases falling below 3000 over the past three days, the CDC said.
Energy failed to participate in the broader move higher as oil prices remained flat despite a larger-than-expected weekly draw in U.S. crude stockpiles of 4.7 million barrels.
On the economic front, consensus-topping durable goods orders for July, strengthened investor optimism over the pace of the economic recovery.
U.S. durable goods orders jumped by 11.2% in July, topping economists forecasts for a 4.3% increase.
The biggest single contribution to the headline came from surging auto production, but this does ""not recover the lost ground from the spring,"" Pantheon Macroeconomics said.

The company reported billings of $1.15 billion, an increase of 6% year-over-year.

758,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 26, 2020 03:58PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: 3 Things to Watch for August 27,"By Liz Moyer
Investing.com -- Remote working and learning has been a boon to the tech sector, pushing the broader market to a new high even as the U.S. economy struggles to overcome the damage from pandemic lockdowns.
On Wednesday, it was Salesforce.com Inc (NYSE:CRM) that pushed the market higher after reporting better than expected earnings. More often than not over the last few weeks, gains have been driven by Fab 5 stocks such as Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN).
Speaking of Amazon, CEO and founder Jeff Bezos now has a net worth of $200 billion… that's with a B. Amazon stock surged 2.9% on Wednesday.
Everyone from stock investors to currency traders awaits comments by Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell on Thursday. He is expected to talk about inflation and the outlook for monetary policy as the Fed guides the U.S. through its recovery.
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:
1. All eyes and ears on Fed's Powell
Powell is scheduled to speak just after 9:00 AM ET (1300 GMT) at the central bank's virtual annual conference (this is normally held in person at Jackson Hole, Wyoming). At this point, the Fed is trying to boost inflation by allowing it to track above its 2% target rate, even though inflation has been below that level for most of the last decade. With interest rates at or close to zero, real rates have turned negative.
The Fed needs more inflation to charge growth back into an economy that has been badly damaged by the effects of the global pandemic, especially since low rates have given it little flexibility in loosening monetary policy. Powell is expected to offer a summary of the Fed's year-long review of monetary policy initiatives.
2. Economic data on jobs and output
Thursday is when weekly unemployment numbers come out at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT). Analysts tracked by Investing.com expect initial claims will be 1 million, down slightly from the 1.1 million new unemployment claims the previous week. Continued jobless claims are expected to be 14.4 million, also down slightly from 14.8 million the prior week.
The unemployment trend has improved from the worst of the economic crisis sparked by mass business shut downs this spring, but new claims have persisted at or above the 1 million mark, suggesting companies continue to struggle. Federal pandemic unemployment insurance payments of $600 on top of state benefits also expired, and Congress has yet to approve new emergency aid.
Gross national product for the second quarter will be revised again, with the number expected out at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT). The expectation is that output fell 32.5% from the first quarter. That is better than the 34.3% initially estimated last month.
3. Pandemic beauty habits fall by the wayside
Americans' beauty regimens fell to the wayside during the lockdowns as people took to sweatpants and accepted scraggly eyebrows and bad dye jobs.
Cosmetics giant  Coty Inc  (NYSE:COTY), which runs the Covergirl, OPI, and Clairol brands, is expected to post a loss per share of 13 cents on revenue of $1.27 billion. Any declines in salon product sales could be offset by gains from its Adidas (OTC:ADDYY) and Gucci brands. Shares fell 1.8% on Wednesday.
Makeup retailer Ulta Beauty Inc (NASDAQ:ULTA) is expected to report profit of 10 cents a share on revenue of $1.26 billion. Shares rose 0.4% on Wednesday.

Commercial air carrier stocks lost altitude, with the S&P 1500 Airline index dipping 1.5% even after the White House announced President Trump was weighing an executive action to avoid massive layoffs in the sector.
The U.S. Federal Reserve is expected to unveil a new framework intended to soften the central bank's inflation stance, which Chairman Jerome Powell is expected to address during his remarks on Thursday as part of the Kansas City Fed's virtual Jackson Hole symposium.

Communications services led the 11 major sectors in the S&P in percentage gains. 
Second-quarter earnings season has wound down, with 483 of the companies in the S&P 500 having reported. Of those, 82.2% have beaten consensus, according to Refinitiv data.
In aggregate, analysts now see earnings for the April to June quarter having dropped by 29.9% year-on-year, according to Refinitiv.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise (NYSE:HPE) Co rose 4.1% after its full-year profit outlook beat expectations, while tax software firm  Intuit  Inc (NASDAQ:INTU) advanced 2.5% on a 17% rise in quarterly revenue.
Apparel retailer  Nordstrom Inc  (NYSE:JWN) tumbled 5.1% following its bigger-than-expected quarterly losses after being forced by mandated lockdowns to shutter its stores.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.37-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.38-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Hudson (NYSE:HUD)'s Bay Co, the owner of luxury department store Saks Fifth Avenue, has ditched its plan to raise up to $900 million in debt after prospective investors requested a higher interest rate than the company was willing to pay, people familiar with the matter said on Wednesday.
The pulled bond offering highlights the perceived risk of lending to brick-and-mortar North American retail chains, even as swaths of the United States and Canada reopen stores and many industries have had easy access to new financing. 
Hudson's Bay, which also owns eponymous department stores in Canada, had sought the bond financing in June to shore up its balance sheet as the COVID-19 pandemic crimped sales. 
However, Hudson's Bay declined to take on the extra debt after finding the interest rate would be higher than initially expected and would come with financially restrictive terms, the sources said. Hudson's Bay also did not immediately need the extra cash, the sources added, requesting anonymity as the matter is private. 
Hudson's Bay declined to comment. 
Competing department store operators  Nordstrom Inc  (N:JWN) and Macy's Inc (N:M) earlier this year raised capital to bolster their balance sheets as they closed their stores to help curb the spread of COVID-19.
Other department store chains filed for bankruptcy because of the pandemic, including Saks rival Neiman Marcus Group and J.C. Penney Co Inc.
In March, Hudson's Bay closed all ts stores due to the coronavirus outbreak. Its stores in Canada and the U.S. are now open, according to the retailer's website.

Hudson's Bay Chief Executive Richard Baker led a group of investors that took the retailer private this year for close to C$2 billion ($1.52 billion).

SEATTLE/MONTREAL (Reuters) - Pilots from  Boeing Co  (N:BA) and Transport Canada were set to take off on Wednesday morning on a flight test of the 737 MAX jetliner, grounded worldwide after two fatal crashes, according to one industry source and FlightAware data.
The test of safety upgrades comes roughly two months after another flight evaluation by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). It marks another crucial step in Boeing's long-delayed path to resume commercial service of the jetliner. 
The flight was slated to take off from King County International Airport, also known as Boeing field, around 8:45 a.m. local time, FlightAware data showed.
The Canadian tests are part of the regulator's ""independent review"" on whether to validate Boeing's proposed changes to the aircraft, Transport Canada has said.
Transport Canada said it was taking special precautions because of COVID, with its employees returning to British Columbia after components of the testing, including evaluations on the engineering simulator at Boeing and the flight test in U.S. airspace. 
The 737 MAX was grounded in March 2019 after crashes in Ethiopia and Indonesia killed 346 people.
Boeing told analysts in late July that MAX deliveries would resume in the fourth quarter, a fresh delay of several weeks that raises the prospect that its U.S. return to service could slip into 2021.
Boeing stock was down 1.21% to $172.52 on Wednesday.
Transport Canada, believed to be the first non-U.S. regulator to conduct such test activities, is also preparing to participate in the U.S.-led Joint Operational Evaluation Board (JOEB) which would evaluate minimum pilot training requirements with partners from Europe and Brazil. 

JOEB is currently planned for mid-September, according to a person briefed on the matter.

The group plans to cut employee numbers in those countries by about 20% and contractor numbers by around half to ensure profitability at lower oil prices, the spokesman told Reuters, adding that the targets were communicated internally on Tuesday.
Equinor will also not drill any new unconventional wells this year in the United States, where it has acreage in the Bakken and Marcellus shale formations, he said. 
The plans, which the company has been working on since the spring, would not involve asset sales, he added. 
""There is no change in our acreage portfolio. The action that we are taking now is to ensure that our business is profitable in a lower price scenario,"" the spokesman said.
Some staff cuts would come as a result of the sale of Equinor's Eagle Ford assets last year, he said. 
The spokesman said he could not specify the number of employees and contractors that could be affected, but said Equinor's U.S. office was the second largest after Norway.
Equinor had 21,000 employees at the end of 2019.
The majority state-owned firm came under intense scrutiny in the Norwegian media earlier this year over mounting losses in the United States, with Norway's Oil and Energy Minister Tina Bru demanding more transparency on foreign investments.
Brent crude (LCOc1) price plunged to a more than two-decade low and U.S. oil prices turned negative in April due a sharp fall in demand during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Oil prices have since recovered and are holding near five-month highs as U.S. producers shut most of their offshore Gulf of Mexico output ahead of Hurricane Laura, and following a drop in U.S. crude inventories.[O/R]

The drug developer is one of the leading U.S. contenders in the race to develop a safe and effective vaccine against the novel coronavirus and its candidate, mRNA-1273, is already in the Phase 3 stage of human testing. 
Moderna is now reporting interim data from the Phase 1 study, which includes new analysis from 20 additional people and details on how the vaccine performs in older people. 
The analysis looked at 100 microgram dosage that has been selected for the larger Phase 3 trial. Moderna said the immune responses in those aged between 56 and 70 years, above 70 and those in the age-group of 18 and 55 were similar.
The data is being presented at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices meeting on Wednesday. 
The company has so far enrolled over 13,000 participants in the late-stage study and about 18% of the total participants are Black, Latino, American Indian or Alaska Native, groups that are the hardest hit by the pandemic.
Moderna, which has no drugs in the market, has received nearly $1 billion from the U.S. government under a plan to speed up vaccine development for COVID-19. It has also struck a $1.5 billion supply agreement with the United States. 

Shares of the drug developer rose more than 7% to $71.35 after the data. They have more than tripled in value so far this year and results from its studies have boosted the broader market.

Investing.com --  It's out with the ballgowns and in with the sneakers. 
Dick's Sporting Goods (NYSE:DKS) surged more than 13% after reporting its highest-ever quarterly sales and earnings as Americans went outdoors to play. 
On the other end of the spectrum, Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN) dropped almost 7% because who needs haute couture at home?
Right in the middle, lifestyle retailers Urban Outfitters (NASDAQ:URBN) soared 23% after reporting a surprise profit while  American Eagle Outfitters  (NYSE:AEO) and Abercrombie and Fitch (NYSE:ANF) also rose. 
Dicks's Sporting Goods reported earnings per share of $3.21, more than double the expected $1.12, on sales of $2.71 billion, compared to the estimated $2.42 billion.  
“During this pandemic, the importance of health and fitness has accelerated and participation in socially distant, outdoor activities has increased. There has also been a greater shift toward athletic and active lifestyle product with people spending more time working and exercising at home,"" said Dick's Chief Executive Officer Edward W. Stack. ""The majority of our assortment sits squarely at the center of these trends, and while mindful of the uncertainty in the current environment, we are in a great lane right now.""
Nordstrom's sales of $1.86 billion missed the estimated revenue of $2.37 billion. 
Nordstrom President and Chief Brand Officer Pete Nordstrom said on an earnings call Tuesday that the company recognizes the shift in preferences and has pivoted to offer more casual options.
""We're getting a lot of very clear signals about what's relevant and meaningful to our customers in this moment,"" Nordstrom said. ""We're having some outsized performance and things like active and home and what have you, and it gives us a lot of confidence on what's going to happen here going in the second half of the year because we are in such a clean inventory position.""
Urban Outfitters reported earnings per share of 35 cents, compared to the expected 40-cent loss, on sales of $803.27 million versus the estimated $678.77 million.
But it wasn't just the comfy rompers that pulled the company up last quarter. Shoppers were more interested in comforters and rugs, at least through the Anthropologie brand.
""Home has been a real standout positive comping throughout the season and it gains importance in the fourth quarter,"" said Anthropologie Global President Hillary Super in an earnings call on Tuesday. ""So from that perspective between the shift to casual, the heavier weight of Home as well as beauty and terrain, we feel well-positioned for the fourth quarter.""

The announcement comes as Quebec braces for a new taxi reform bill, which will abolish the costly taxi permit system and also make way for app-based ride-hailing services such as Uber. 
The company did not give a specific date for the expansion of its service throughout the province.
Quebec, which makes up 24% of the Canadian population, was worst hit by the coronavirus crisis in the country and began to gradually reopen its economy in May. 
Uber's ride-hailing segment also remained battered by the pandemic during the second quarter, with revenue from the United States and Canada, its largest combined market, declining to $1.25 billion.

As part of an ongoing pilot program started in 2016, the company's services are currently available in Montreal, Quebec, and Gatineau.

China has become a hot spot for trying out autonomous driving vehicles. Toyota-backed (T:7203) Pony.ai, Baidu Inc (O:BIDU), Nissan-backed (T:7201) WeRide and Didi Chuxing are all testing autonomous cars in different cities as automakers and tech companies are investing billions in the technology.
Volkswagen, the biggest foreign automaker in China, will start the test in Hefei with Audi's e-tron electric sport utility vehicles from September, it said in a statement. The test will be open to the public from next year. 
In May, Volkswagen said it would invest 1 billion euros ($1.18 billion) to take a 50% stake in the state-owned parent of Chinese electronic vehicle group JAC. Volkswagen will also take full management control of its existing electric vehicle joint venture with JAC in Hefei by raising its stake to 75% from 50%.
Volkswagen also has ventures with state-owned China FAW Group Corp Ltd [SASACJ.UL] and SAIC Motor Corp Ltd (SS:600104).
The German car company sold 1.59 million vehicles in China in the first six months of 2020, down 17% from 1.92 million vehicles in the same period last year. For all of 2019, Volkswagen sold around 4.23 million vehicles in the country.
In June Volkswagen closed its $2.6 billion investment in Pittsburgh-based self-driving startup Argo AI, in which  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) also has a stake.

The travel industry has been hit hard by the pandemic. Lockdowns which prevented flying from March to June have been replaced in the UK by quarantine rules, stopping a hoped-for rebound in traffic and leading to thousands of job losses. 
Gatwick, owned by VINCI Airports and Global Infrastructure Partners, said on Wednesday it would start consultation about shedding 600 jobs, as it was only operating at about 20% of last year's capacity.
Passenger numbers at Gatwick in August, usually one of the busiest months, are down 80% compared to last year, it added. 
Gatwick's move follows plans by some of its biggest airline customers to shrink, and comes after the UK's no.1 airport, Heathrow, launched a voluntary redundancy scheme and said it could not rule out further job losses.
easyJet (L:EZJ), British Airways (L:ICAG) and Virgin Atlantic have already announced about 20,000 job cuts between them and warned travel will take years to recover. BA and Virgin have both suspended operations at Gatwick for the time being. 
Airports and airlines in the UK have called on ministers to scrap the quarantine policy in favour of a testing regime which would allow more travel.
""We are in ongoing talks with government to see what sector specific support can be put in place for the industry at this time,"" Gatwick CEO Stewart Wingate said. 

Gatwick said that currently 75% of its staff were on the government's job retention scheme which is due to end in October.

The World Economic Forum said the coronavirus has forced it to delay its high-profile gathering of global business and financial leaders in the Swiss resort of Davos until early next summer.
Normally held each January in the ski town, the gathering has attracted political leaders including U.S. President Donald Trump and German Chancellor Angela Merkel, as well a parade of billionaires, executives and celebrities to debate global challenges.
The most recent installment drew 3,000 participants from 90 countries, plus legions of support staff and hundreds of journalists. Nearby hotels host glamorous receptions to complement the debates held in the town’s conference center.
Next year’s event -- titled “The Great Reset” -- was intended to discuss how to shape the post-virus economy. Despite the urgency of that conversation, “the advice from experts is that we cannot do so safely in January,” WEF said in a statement on Wednesday.
Founder Klaus Schwab told Bloomberg Television earlier this month that while planning for the event was underway, it wasn’t clear what form it would take or when it would happen.
The Forum now intends to hold a series of digital “Davos Dialogues” in the week of Jan. 25 to allow global leaders to share their views virtually.
It’s not the first time WEF has budged from Davos. Its 2002 meeting was held in New York, to show solidarity following the Sept. 11 terror attacks.
The event has attracted local opposition in the past over the disruption and cost of policing the presence of so many wealthy and high-profile delegates.
Still, the postponement will be an economic blow to the hospitality industry. The event generated an estimated 94 million francs ($103 million) in revenue for Switzerland in 2017, according to a University of St. Gallen study. It garnered 2 million francs in tax revenue for the town.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened a tad higher on Wednesday but participants were largely content to sit on the sidelines with one eye on Hurricane Laura as it bears down on the Gulf of Mexico coast, and the other on the Federal Reserve's keenly-awaited symposium on Thursday. 
The market was given a modest boost by the only major economic data of the day, as durable goods orders rose 11.2% in July, much more than the 4.3% rise expected. Even when adjusted for volatile defense and aviation items, core durable goods rose 2.4% on the month, beating expectations for a 2.0% rise.
By 9:35 AM ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 38 points, or 0.1%, at 28,810 points. The S&P 500 was up 0.1% and the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.6%.
The Nasdaq in particular was helped by strength in software stocks, after Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) reported much better-than-expected results for the latest quarter after the closing bell on Tuesday. Salesforce stock rose 17.9%, for once overshadowing the likes of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock, which rose 1.6% and 2.0%, respectively.
Apple was supported as Wedbush saying the stock could be worth as much as $700. Tesla was bid up after Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) more than doubled its target price to $2,500. Sell-side analysts have been forced to ratchet up their estimates for the stock to bring them into line with a new reality that retail investors, who trade more on momentum than on fundamentals, are playing the dominant role in setting the stock's price. However, Tesla's success in scaling up production in recent quarters has also forced them to abandon their previous skepticism about its ability to execute.
Others aren't convinced. 
""We’re now in the phase of the bubble where analysts are trampling all over each other to hype stocks into the stratosphere,"" said Northman Trader founder Sven Henrich via Twitter.

""Who needs consumers when you have a Fed blowing a big fat asset bubble?"" Henrich said.
Other standout gainers included Dick’s Sporting Goods (NYSE:DKS) stock, which rose 10.2% to its highest in three years on the back of a strong quarter in which customers binged on hiking and workout gear as the pandemic forced a change in exercise habits across the country.

LONDON (Reuters) - HSBC Global Asset Management (L:HSBA) has teamed up with climate change advisory firm Pollination Group to create an asset management venture focused on ""natural capital"", which seeks to put a value on resources such as water, soil and air to help to protect the environment.
The new venture - HSBC Pollination Climate Asset Management - will look to raise up to $1 billion for its first fund next year, targeting investments that ""preserve, protect and enhance nature over the long-term"", it said in a statement on Wednesday.
It aims to attract capital from institutional investors, including sovereign wealth funds, pension funds and insurers into natural capital investments.
A growing number of asset owners such as pension funds are looking to invest in projects that help to protect the world's biodiversity at the same time as turning a profit.
""Clients are increasingly focused on environmental matters and this initiative is designed to help them achieve a financial return, while at the same time creating a positive impact on the world’s biodiversity,"" said HSBC Global Asset Management Chief Executive Nicolas Moreau.
Investment in natural capital will provide exposure to projects that include sustainable forestry, regenerative and sustainable agriculture, water supply, nature based bio-fuels, or projects that generate returns from reducing greenhouse emissions.
The first fund will be followed by a carbon credit fund of up to $2 billion. HSBC intends to become a cornerstone investor in the first fund.
HSBC Global Asset Management and Pollination will both provide resources to the planned joint venture and it will operate independently. 
""To reach the goals set in the Paris Agreement we need to originate and fund new approaches that protect nature, at scale,"" said Martijn Wilder AM, co-founding partner at Pollination, referring to the 2015 climate deal that aims to keep carbon emissions below 2 degrees Celsius by 2050.

784,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 26, 2020 07:40AM ET</span>","Wall Street strategists see market back-pedaling by year-end, Reuters poll shows","By Noel Randewich
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Don't get too attached to those recent stock market gains, at least according to strategists polled by Reuters. 
Wall Street's rally is likely run out of fuel as investors fret about the November presidential election, with the major indexes ending 2020 below current record highs, according to the poll, conducted over the past two weeks. 
The S&P 500 will end 2020 at 3,300 points, down over 4% from current levels, according to the median forecast of about 55 market strategists and fund managers.
That would leave the closely watched benchmark with an annual 2% gain in a year that saw the coronavirus cripple the global economy and leave tens of millions of Americans out of work. 
While strategists are generally unsuccessful at predicting stock market performance, their forecasts provide a valuable snapshot of expectations across Wall Street. 
Uncertainty about the outcome of the Nov. 3 presidential vote and how it affects markets is becoming a major concern for investors. 
For weeks ahead of the 2016 election, strategists warned that instability caused by a potential Donald Trump victory would hurt Wall Street, only to see markets rally after he won.
With President Trump repeatedly claiming, without evidence, that plans to allow mail-in ballots would lead to a surge in electoral fraud, some investment strategists warn that uncertainty about the integrity of the vote and its outcome could roil financial markets. 
So could a potential knockout blow by Democrats, giving the party control of Congress as well as the executive branch, which could lead to higher taxes and tighter regulation, some respondents said.
""The market is not pricing in the potential for a Democrat sweep in November, which would create massive headwinds for the economy and the markets,"" said Synovus (NYSE:SNV) Trust portfolio manager Daniel Morgan. 
The S&P 500 last week returned to record highs for the first time since February, wiping out all of the deep losses caused by the coronavirus pandemic. The index's new highs confirm, according to a widely accepted definition, that the S&P 500 entered a new bull market after tumbling to a low on March 23.
Behind the S&P 500's over 50% recovery have been bets on a potential coronavirus vaccine, trillions of dollars in fiscal and monetary stimulus, and a surprisingly high percentage of companies that beat earnings expectations in the second quarter. 
Still, many investors worry about the disconnect between the stock market and the U.S. economy, which remains crippled by high unemployment and a resurgence in virus cases in parts of the United States. 
Forecasts from IBES data from Refinitiv show analysts expect a 20% decline in earnings for S&P 500 companies for 2020, with the second quarter still seen as the low point for this year. Earnings are expected to increase 28% in 2021, according to Refinitiv.
The poll also showed strategists expect the Dow Jones Industrial average (DJI) to finish 2020 at around 28,330, which would represent an increase of less than 1% from Tuesday. Up 55% from its March bottom, the Dow is still down nearly 5% from its February record high.
The median prediction for the S&P 500's closing level in 2021 was 3,500, equivalent to a near 2% increase from Tuesday's level.

785,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 26, 2020 07:18AM ET</span>",Xiaomi Profit Beats After Growing Premium Phone Share,"(Bloomberg) -- Xiaomi (OTC:XIACF) Corp. reported better-than-expected profit after cracking the Chinese market for high-end smartphones and growing its share of overseas markets like Europe and India.
The Chinese smartphone maker more than doubled net income to 4.49 billion yuan ($716 million) in the June quarter, beating the highest analyst estimate. Sales increased 3.1% to 53.5 billion yuan. Xiaomi’s overseas business has recovered to pre-Covid-19 levels, acting Chief Financial Officer Wang Xiang said Wednesday.
Smartphone shipments in European countries like France and Spain grew by 64.9% in the quarter, propelling Xiaomi into the No. 3 spot in the region for the first time, the company said, citing consultancy Canalys. The phonemaker also kept its top position in India in the quarter even though the country’s smartphone shipments halved during lockdown measures. That drove a 12% fall in the company’s device shipments globally, according to IDC, just when tensions between Delhi and Beijing threatened to further depress sales in its biggest foreign market.

Xiaomi may be able to offset some of the hit through higher-margin phones and market share gains against biggest competitor Huawei Technologies Co. The company shipped 28.3 million smartphones during the quarter, with average selling prices increasing 11.8% from a year earlier, reflecting deeper inroads into premium devices.
”What’s encouraging was Xiaomi’s premium end phones recorded hyper growth in overseas market,” Wang said. “This reflects a major breakthrough in high-end market.”
Huawei is struggling to sustain smartphone output because of U.S. curbs on its in-house chip design and supply. Taking sales from its larger rival will become Xiaomi’s “main growth driver” until next year, according to China Renaissance analysts Jason Sun, Michelle Zhang and April Zhang. They estimate Xiaomi’s smartphone shipments could surge by over a third to 217 million units in 2021.
“Huawei’s increasing use of third-party chips will reduce its competitive advantage in phones and, hence, give Xiaomi an opportunity to gain share in China where most Internet Service revenue comes from,”  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analysts including Yunchen Tsai and Sharon Shih wrote in a research report ahead of the earnings release.
Xiaomi appointed a new chief financial officer, former  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) head of Asia technology Alain Lam, confirming a Bloomberg News report. The veteran investment banker, who worked on the public listings of  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd., Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and  Pinduoduo  (NASDAQ:PDD) Inc., will take up his new role in October and could help Xiaomi uncover value in the more than 300 companies it has backed. That sprawling portfolio of startups, ranging from Segway owner Ninebot Inc. to portable charger maker Zimi and Huami Corp., are key to Xiaomi’s longer-term ambition of building a network of home devices for the so-called Internet of Things.
In China, domestically oriented businesses such as media and finance could bounce back alongside an economic recovery. Xiaomi, known for lower-priced phones, has been trying to lift its average retail price to cushion margins. Chief Executive Officer Lei Jun this month introduced a suite of smartphones priced close to the iPhone 11 and transparent TVs costing 49,999 yuan to commemorate the company’s 10th anniversary. The co-founder also pledged to develop advanced manufacturing to fuel China’s high-end electronics making ambition.
Xiaomi’s shares, which have mostly traded below their HK$17 2018 initial public offering price, jumped 5.7% at the Hong Kong close on Wednesday before results were released. The company will join Hong Kong’s benchmark index from September in one of the gauge’s biggest revamps, a potential boost for the stock.

786,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 26, 2020 07:16AM ET</span>",Stock Futures Largely Unchanged; Powell Speech Key,"By Peter Nurse   
Investing.com - U.S. stocks are set to open largely unchanged Wednesday, consolidating after posting more highs on Tuesday, with investors staying cautious ahead of a key U.S. Federal Reserve symposium.
At 7:10 AM ET (1110 GMT), S&P 500 Futures traded flat, the Dow Futures contract fell 57 points, or 0.2%, while Nasdaq 100 Futures gained 43 points, or 0.4%. 
All eyes will be on Fed Chairman Jerome Powell when he speaks on Thursday to the central bank’s Jackson Hole conference, being held virtually this year because of the coronavirus pandemic.
He is expected to provide an update on the Fed’s review of its policies and practices, with many anticipating he will provide a framework which sees U.S. interest rates staying lower for longer.
“I wouldn’t be surprised if interest rates are still zero five years from now,” said Jason Furman, a former chief White House economist and now Harvard University professor, in a Bloomberg report.
Tuesday saw a mixed trading session on Wall Street, as a rare pullback in Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock hurt the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which fell 60 points, or 0.2%. However, the S&P 500 gained 0.4% and the NASDAQ Composite jumped 0.8%, both settling in record territory.
Investors have been buoyed in recent days by signs the country is getting to grips with the Covid-19 outbreak, with daily cases now at 60% of the levels seen at the peak in July, and the Trump administration aggressively promoting new treatments. 
On top of this, the U.S. and China stressed they saw 'progress' in the latest trade talks, despite the fraught nature of the relationship between the two countries.
That said, U.S. economic data has been mixed, with consumer confidence dropping to a more than six-year low Tuesday, overshadowing a boom in new home sales. Last week, the number of Americans seeking unemployment benefits unexpectedly climbed back above one million.
Durable goods data are out at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT), with expectations pointing to slowing growth from the previous month.
The retail sector has more earnings scheduled Wednesday, with jeweler  Tiffany & Co  (NYSE:TIF), Dick’s Sporting Goods (NYSE:DKS) and Williams-Sonoma (NYSE:WSM), which sells kitchen-wares and home furnishings, all set to report numbers.
Oil prices were lower Wednesday, consolidating after settling at five-month highs Tuesday as U.S. producers prepared for the onslaught of Hurricane Laura by shutting operations.
Laura is expected to make landfall late Wednesday or early Thursday along the Texas-Louisiana coast, a region that includes nearly half of U.S. refining capacity, as a Category 4 hurricane, according to the National Hurricane Center. 
Eyes will also be on the official U.S. inventory data later Wednesday, after the American Petroleum Institute showed stockpiles fell more than expected last week.
U.S. crude futures traded 0.4% lower at $43.17 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract fell 0.2% to $46.18.

The fund giant, with about $5 trillion in assets, said in a statement that its Hong Kong business primarily served institutional clients and not retail investors, which are its primary focus.
It said the exit would happen gradually and take between 6 months to two years.
Vanguard, which launched a wholly foreign-owned enterprise (WFOE) in China in May 2017, said it will ""gradually cease (its) onshore presence in Hong Kong and make an orderly exit"" from its Hong Kong ETF, Mandatory Provident Fund and Index-Tracking Investment Schemes businesses.

In a separate statement, a spokesman confirmed that Vanguard would also close in Japan, and shift its primary office in Asia to Shanghai.
""Our future focus in Asia is on Mainland China,"" the spokesman said in an email.
Vanguard's closure plans were first reported on Wednesday by Ignites Asia, a Financial Times service.
Vanguard announced a China advisory joint venture in December 2019 with China's leading fintech company, now known as Ant Group, to provide retail investment advisory services.

789,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 26, 2020 05:51AM ET</span>",StockBeat: Europe Waits for Powell With Bated Breath,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- What are European stocks afraid of?
Markets have settled into a very firm holding pattern ahead of the U.S. Federal Reserve’s symposium that starts tomorrow, largely ignoring what are really two quite important developments.
For one, Germany has extended its job support mechanism, known as Kurzarbeit, by another 12 months through the end of 2021. This is one of the most important elements of the fiscal stimulus rolled out by Europe’s largest economy.
According to Der Spiegel, the Kurzarbeit scheme cost the federal government 11 billion euros ($13 billion) just in the four months through July. But that has put a very firm safety net under the purchasing power of millions of households – 6.7 million as of the end of May, the latest month for which official data are available.
For another, French Prime Minister Jean Castex dropped further hints about the details of a 100 billion-euro recovery plan next week. That, too, is set to put a safety net under the continent’s second-biggest economy.
Yet the CAC 40 was up only 0.3% in low volume on Wednesday. The DAX, after a subdued start, managed a slightly better 0.5% increase.
Up to a degree, the inability of Europe to keep up with the U.S.’s record-setting pace this week is due to the fact that the relative trajectories of the pandemic on both sides of the Atlantic have shifted in the U.S.’s favor in recent weeks. New cases are falling stateside and rising in Europe (although they still remain lower than the U.S. in absolute terms, and even more so in per capita terms).
But there is another factor at work, too. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell is expected by many to announce important changes to the framework for monetary policy in his keynote speech on Thursday, that will sketch out a future in which U.S. interest rates stay lower for longer than thought.
Such speculation has been one of the biggest factors behind the euro’s recent rise against the dollar.
At $1.20 or below, no-one is yet sounding alarm bells, but conventional wisdom says that if the euro were to rise much higher, then the export-sensitive economies of the euro zone may suffer.
But that is only true up to a point. Because the flip side of dollar weakness is not just euro strength, but strength in currencies around the world, notably in emerging markets. China’s yuan, for example, closed at its highest level in seven months overnight. As emerging markets feel the load of their dollar-denominated debt easing, then demand for eurozone goods and services should hold up well enough. 
Arguably the bigger risk is that Powell doesn't announce anything major, leading to a dollar snapback that would leave emerging currencies in a worse position to deal with any renewed global surge in coronavirus cases as the northern hemisphere winter sets in. Either way, the increasingly narrow range in which the Stoxx 600 has traded since peaking in June seems set to be challenged hard next week."
790,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 26, 2020 05:50AM ET</span>","What you see is what you'll get: No upside for European stocks, Reuters poll shows","By Julien Ponthus
LONDON (Reuters) - European stocks are expected to stall for the rest of 2020 and miss out on the bull market which has propelled Wall Street to record highs, a Reuters poll of 27 fund managers, strategists and brokers published on Wednesday showed. 
Taken over the past two weeks, the survey showed the STOXX 600 (STOXX) would reach only 375 points by the end of 2020, roughly the level the pan-European index closed at on Tuesday. 
That would translate to a yearly loss of about 10% and expose the failure of European stocks to completely rebound after the coronavirus-driven March market crash knocked them 38% from their February highs.
By comparison, the S&P 500 (SPX) in New York is up more than 6% on the year, cruising into uncharted new highs on the back of a stellar performance by tech stocks such as Apple (O:AAPL) as well as trillions of dollars' worth of fiscal and monetary stimulus.
That U.S. outperformance has taken many investors by surprise. 
Betting on euro zone shares outperforming was a consensus call about a month ago when EU leaders announced a 750 billion euro ($886 billion) recovery fund after four days and nights of acrimonious negotiations.
Then, European countries were believed to be handling the pandemic and the reopening of their economies better, and political risk was seen shifting from Brussels to Washington amid a wave of unrest and the upcoming U.S. presidential election in November.
The economic narrative has however quickly changed, with the latest data published on Friday showing Europe's economic recovery losing momentum while activity seems to be steadily picking up on the other side of the Atlantic. 
Progress for Europe's bourses is also expected to be limited in 2021 with an average expectation for the STOXX 600 to reach 410 points by the end of next year, still well below the record 433.9 set on Feb. 19. 
On March 16, less than a month after hitting its peak, the index collapsed to 268.57, with airlines, hotels, banks and energy companies among the worst hit.
FALLING PROFITS 
A rebound fuelled by unprecedented global monetary and fiscal stimulus - coupled with hopes for a vaccine and economies swiftly reopening - lost steam at the beginning of June and has since stalled amid falling corporate profits. 
""We think stock markets will stay in a kind of trading range of around 10%, supported by low (bond) yields on the one hand, and on the other, capped by many risks: economic weakness, geopolitics and the presidential election in the U.S."", said Jean-Marie Mercadal, deputy chief executive officer at OFI Asset Management.
Mercadal said much of the expected rebound in corporate profits had already been priced in. 
So far in the second-quarter earnings season, companies in the STOXX 600 have posted a 57.7% year-on-year fall in profits, the latest I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv shows. 
Earnings are expected to decline by 37.8% and 20.5% for the last two quarters of the year, before bouncing back by 41.7% and 65.3% in the first two quarters of 2021. 
Major indexes around Europe are expected to follow the trend of the pan-European STOXX 600 and only gradually recover from the March 2020 market crash. 
France's CAC 40 (FCHI) is seen reaching 5,645 points by the end of 2021 after it surpassed 6,100 in February. 
London's FTSE 100 (FTSE) is also not expected to reclaim its 2020 high of 7,689.67 points before the end of the 2021, where it is seen at 6,752.
There's more optimism for Germany's trade-sensitive DAX (GDAXI), seen rising to a new high by the end of 2021 at 14,120 points, well above its 13,795 February record.

The U.S. fund giant, with about $6 trillion in assets, said the Hong Kong business is targeted at institutional clients, and not the retail investors that are the firm’s primary focus. The changes will impact staff in the city, a number of whom will be made redundant while others stay for a period of time, it said.
“Unfortunately, from a distribution business standpoint, the current industry dynamics are better suited to institutional investors and do not currently support the scale needed for us to operate” the firm’s low-cost model, the company said in an emailed statement.
Vanguard has been targeting China for growth in Asia, teaming up with billionaire Jack Ma’s Ant Group to develop a robo-adviser service for the more than 900 million digital customers of the fintech giant. That’s a first step in winning a slice of the nation’s fast-growing asset management business.
The world’s second-largest money manager runs at least six ETFs on the Hong Kong exchange including funds tracking China, Japan, Asia ex-Japan and developed Europe. The company will also exit Hong-Kong’s Mandatory Provident Fund and Index-Tracking Collective Investment Scheme platforms. The firm’s ETF assets in Hong Kong are about HK$3.3 billion ($430 million), according to data compiled by Bloomberg News.
In Japan, Vanguard said it will no longer actively market products or distribute new ones.
The Malvern, Pennsylvania-based money manager said the move doesn’t suggest the company isn’t bullish on Hong Kong.

792,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 26, 2020 05:10AM ET</span>",Thai protest boycotts force businesses to pick sides,"By Chayut Setboonsarng and Panarat Thepgumpanat
BANGKOK (Reuters) - The owner of Burger King's franchise in Thailand became the latest company on Wednesday to bow to boycott calls by protesters who accused it of advertising on a television network they brand pro-government.
The protesters seek the departure of Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, a former junta leader, and new elections. Some have also called for reforms of the powerful monarchy of King Maha Vajiralongkorn, long a taboo subject.
Supporters of the student-led protests that have run for more than a month launched an online campaign to urge patrons to shun the franchise, Minor International Pcl, and other businesses that had advertised on Nation Multimedia Group.
A spokeswoman for Minor Food Group said it was pulling advertisements.
""The company accepts the views of its customers and will consider the use of appropriate media, with immediate effect,"" the group said in a statement to Reuters.
Nation Multimedia Group's chairman, Shine Bunnag, told Reuters the boycott was ""social bullying from a group of keyboard thugs"", however.
It has highlighted the emerging political challenge for companies from a protest movement that has grown from Thai campuses with strong support on social media, particularly among young people. 
In another sign of a company making clear it was not siding with the Thai government, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) said on Wednesday it would launch a legal challenge to a demand that it block access to a group that often mocks the monarchy. 
""The political division in society is permeating to businesses... putting companies in a very tight spot,"" said Ben Kiatkwankul of Maverick Consulting Group, which advises companies on reputation and government affairs.
""It is almost impossible to please everyone,"" he told Reuters. 
There are parallels with Hong Kong, where businesses seen as antagonistic to the democracy movement were boycotted by its supporters in favour of 'yellow' companies that back the movement in contrast to 'blue' businesses deemed pro-government.
The biggest of dozens of street protests across Thailand to date drew more than 10,000 people in Bangkok on Aug. 16, but social media shows broader support, with some protest hashtags used or shared by millions of accounts.
HASHTAG BAN
The Thai-language hashtag #bannationsponsors began trending late last week after a reporter from Nation, widely seen as conservative, failed to identify herself when interviewing protesters at a rally.
Nation, which also runs an English-language website, said it had reprimanded the reporter, though Shine, its chairman, said she had been scared by ""the mob"".
""We are not the government's voice. We are media that stand with the people. Our principles here are clear: nation, religion, monarchy. Emphasize, monarchy,"" he said by telephone.
Shine said Nation's ratings rose as much as 20% during the incident over the reporter, with some companies having increased their advertisement buys, while the withdrawals had no impact.
""Social bullying is dirty and undemocratic,"" he said. ""We will not be scared"".
Student protestor Tanawat Wongchai said the boycott aimed to ensure Nation was neutral. One of his tweets with the boycott hashtag was retweeted more than 1,000 times.
""If we want the media to change and improve, we have to pressure those sponsors,"" he told Reuters.
Besides running more than 100 Burger King outlets, Minor Food is the domestic franchise owner of Swensen’s and Coffee Club. It also has its own brand, the Pizza Company.
Its shares fell 0.45% on Wednesday, compared to a 0.44% rise in the benchmark index. Burger King's global owner is Restaurant Brands International (NYSE:QSR) Inc..
Food delivery service Foodpanda, a unit of Delivery Hero SE, said after being targeted last week that it would stop advertising on Nation television and ""improve marketing practices"".

Thailand's Yanhee Vitamin Water also said it would stop ads on the outlet and valued its customers’ opinion.

(Reuters) - European stocks inched higher on Wednesday as hopes of additional stimulus for Germany and France outweighed worries about rising cases of COVID-19 across the continent.
Germany's coalition parties agreed to extend economic measures to cushion the effects of the coronavirus crisis at a cost of up to 10 billion euros, including prolonging a short-time work scheme and a freeze on insolvency rules.
Neighbouring France is also set to present its economic recovery plan on Sept. 3, Prime Minister Jean Castex said.
Still, Frankfurt's DAX (GDAXI) rose 0.2% and Paris' CAC 40 (FCHI) was flat, with global markets in a holding pattern ahead of the U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's speech on Thursday that could offer clues on what steps the central bank is willing to take to safeguard a fragile economic recovery.
""The market is eager for guidance on how the Fed might push inflation higher and what that means for monetary policy going forward,"" wrote Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index (STOXX) rose just 0.1%, held back by fears after two confirmed cases of coronavirus re-infections in Europe raised concerns about people's immunity to the virus.
Economic data in the past week has muddled the outlook for a euro zone recovery, keeping the STOXX 600 about 15% below its all-time high, even as U.S. stocks hit new peaks on easing U.S.-China trade tensions and hopes of a coronavirus treatment.
""We've had a disappointing set of flash PMIs last week, which gives you an impression that after the initial rebound, the recovery is going to stall,"" said Andrea Cicione, head of strategy at TS Lombard.
Individual stock moves were mixed, with Swedish radiation therapy equipment maker Elekta (ST:EKTAb) jumping 13.1% after a bigger-than-expected first-quarter profit.
Ambu (CO:AMBUb), which makes diagnostic and life-support devices for hospitals, slumped 12.9% after it cut its full-year earnings forecast.
HiQ International (ST:HIQ) soared 26.5% after private equity firm Triton announced a 3.9 billion crown ($444.92 million) cash bid for the Swedish IT consultancy firm.

 Telecom Italia  (MI:TLIT) rose 3.7% after a local newspaper reported the Italian government had given approval to U.S. investment firm KKR (N:KKR) to buy a minority stake in its secondary grid.

LONDON (Reuters) - Traders sold government bonds and bought stocks on Wednesday, placing riskier bets on optimism about U.S.-China trade and expectations of ample central bank stimulus before a key speech by the U.S. Federal Reserve chairman at Jackson Hole. 
In early London trading, the yield on U.S. 10-year debt rose as high as 0.7190%, close to a two-month peak, as bond traders begin to price in a return to inflation and growth for major economies.
The broad Euro STOXX 600 turned positive in early trading to gain 0.2%, with indexes in Frankfurt and Paris both up a similar amount, though London fell 0.2%. 
The MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 49 countries, gained 0.1%. Wall Street futures gauges were flat.
A day earlier, investors had dumped benchmark U.S. debt (US) and bought stocks after a productive call between top Beijing and Washington officials stoked hopes of smoother trade relations between the world's two biggest economies.
In another sign of a more positive mood, safe-haven gold fell 0.6%, on course for a fourth straight day of losses.
Euro zone bonds calmed, with safe-haven Bund yields rising a smidgeon after enduring on Tuesday their worst session since May as better German economic data and trade dented hunger for government debt.
For many investors, bets on looser policy - the major driver of a powerful recovery for U.S. stocks from pandemic-driven lows in March - were at the forefront.
Fed Chairman Jerome Powell is due to speak at a virtual Jackson Hole symposium on Thursday, where investors think he could outline a more accommodative approach to inflation which would open the door to easier policy for a long time to come.
""Jackson Hole is a big one,"" said Jeremy Gatto, an investment manager at Unigestion in Geneva. 
""Investors are expecting a bit more clarity on what the Fed is looking at. We are likely to see a high level of accommodation for some time to come."" 
Earlier, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan traded flat. 
DATA AND THE DOLLAR
The dollar edged up slightly, after a knock a day earlier on data that showed U.S. consumer confidence falling to the lowest in over six years because of worries over the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on jobs.
Against a basket of currencies the dollar added 0.1% to 93.070, with prospects for the greenback seen as limited should Powell send a dovish message at Jackson Hole. 
Data due later in the day is forecast to show growth in U.S. durable goods orders slowed in July, potentially offering further bad news for the dollar.
The Japanese yen fell 0.1%, with MUFG analysts arguing that uncertainty over the health of Shinzo Abe, the long-serving premier, was adding to downward pressure along with advances for stocks and rising U.S. yields.
In commodity markets, a positive mood on trade and U.S. producers shutting most of their offshore output in the Gulf of Mexico ahead of Hurricane Laura supported Brent crude oil.
Producers evacuated 310 offshore facilities and shut 1.56 million barrels per day of crude output, 84% of Gulf of Mexico's offshore production - near the 90% outage that Hurricane Katrina brought 15 years ago.
Brent futures added 13 cents, or 0.3%, to $45.99 a barrel in early trading, with the benchmarks settled at a five-month high a day earlier.

795,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 26, 2020 04:20AM ET</span>",Ex-U.S. ambassador quits Singapore firm linked to Newcastle United bidders,"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The former U.S. ambassador to Singapore said he had resigned from the board of a firm in the city-state linked to a group bidding for English soccer club Newcastle United citing ""recent revelations"" about the group.
Kirk Wagar said he had quit the board of Axington (SI:AXIN), a firm listed on the Singapore stock exchange's junior bourse. Singaporean businessmen and cousins Terence Loh and Nelson Loh are controlling shareholders in the firm and the chairman is Chinese jewellery merchant Evangeline Shen.
The Lohs and Shen are the sole shareholders and directors of newly founded Bellagraph Nova Group (BN Group), which has described itself as a ""conglomerate"" with turnover last year of $12 billion that is in advanced talks to buy Newcastle.
Reuters reported on Saturday that the Singapore-registered BN Group had admitted to doctoring photos of former U.S. President Barack Obama in marketing materials.
BN Group also said some of the information in those materials was released prematurely or contained errors after Reuters found inconsistencies when speaking to firms and persons BN Group says it is involved with.
Its surprise announcement of a Newcastle bid adds to years of speculation over the future of the club, which has been the subject of several fruitless takeover bids, including a $390 million Saudi-backed deal that collapsed earlier this month.
""ERRANT INDIVIDUALS""
Singapore's main Straits Times newspaper on Wednesday reported BN Group had said the posting of some of its marketing materials ""appears to be the result of the actions of certain errant individuals, possibly with malicious intent.""
BN Group did not respond to a request for comment from Reuters.
Axington, whose shares have fallen around 15% this week and were put on trading halt on Wednesday pending an announcement, did not respond to a request for comment.
Axington has said in filings with the Singapore Exchange (OTC:SPXCY) that it plans to change its name to NETX, the name of a robotics firm BN Group has said is part of its conglomerate.
Wagar, who was Singapore ambassador from 2013 to 2017, said he had been asked to join the board of Axington in June by the Lohs. Filings by the firm said he joined the board in July.
""Due to the recent revelations, I have resigned that position and asked for Axington to advise SGX (Singapore Exchange) and any other relevant parties of that fact,"" Wagar said in response to an emailed request for comment.
The Straits Times quoted BN Group as saying it will appoint independent legal counsel to investigate the posting of the marketing material and will not address any further media queries until investigations are completed.

Various statements attributed to BN Group and published via press release distributor PR Newswire over the last two months have recently been deleted. A password is now required to view BN Group's website.

796,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 26, 2020 03:45AM ET</span>",European Stocks Mixed Amid Caution Over Covid-19 2nd Wave,"By Peter Nurse 
Investing.com - European stock markets traded cautiously early Wednesday, with investors wary of the Covid-19 virus causing further economic damage, while a key speech from the head of the U.S. Federal Reserve loomed in the background.
At 3:40 AM ET (0740 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.2% higher, the CAC 40 in France rose 0.1% and the U.K.'s FTSE index was down 0.2%.
Investors have been buoyed in recent days by signs of the Covid-19 virus receding in the U.S. and the Trump administration forcing the pace of authorizing treatments for it, as well as by progress in trade relations between the U.S. and China.
However, in Europe there have been signs of the virus re-emerging, with the French city of Marseille, for example, tightening restrictions on Tuesday to fight the outbreak. 
""There are fears of a second wave in November,"" Professor Jean-Francois Delfraissy, who heads the scientific council that advises the French government on the pandemic, told France 2 television on Wednesday.
German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz announced Wednesday additional measures to cushion the impact of the coronavirus to the tune of 10 billion euros, while the French government will unveil its economic recovery plan in early September.
Economic data has shown a mixed picture as far as the global recovery is concerned. 
In Europe, the German Ifo survey showed stronger-than-expected business sentiment and French consumer confidence held steady in August, but consumer confidence dropped to a more than six-year low in the United States this month, data showed on Tuesday, overshadowing a boom in new home sales. 
With a light data calendar Wednesday, investors are looking to Thursday’s Jackson Hole symposium, where U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell is due to give a speech, for further guidance on the central bank’s monetary policy framework review. 
In corporate news,  Provident Financial  (LON:PFG) stock dropped 0.6% after the U.K.-based consumer-finance company swung to a first-half pretax loss, as the coronavirus pandemic hit the business.
Oil prices were mixed Wednesday, after settling at five-month highs on Tuesday, as U.S. producers prepared for the onslaught of Hurricane Laura by shutting most of their offshore output.
Laura is expected to make landfall late Wednesday or early Thursday along the Texas-Louisiana coast, a region that includes nearly half of U.S. refining capacity, as a Category 3 hurricane, according to the National Hurricane Center. 
Further price support came from data from the American Petroleum Institute showing U.S. oil stockpiles fell more than expected last week. The Energy Information Administration will release its own official inventory data later on Wednesday.
U.S. crude futures traded 0.2% higher at $43.27 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract rose 0.3% to $46.42. 
Elsewhere, gold futures rose 0.1% to $1,924.80/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% lower at 1.1820.

799,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 26, 2020 02:30AM ET</span>",Banks in bonus balancing act as economies shrink but markets boom,"By Sinead Cruise
LONDON (Reuters) - Major international banks may still pay out big bonuses to high flyers this year even as the pandemic saps the global economy, as fears of losing talent to rivals during a trading boom trump worries of a big compensation bill.
While the likes of HSBC (L:HSBC) and  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) are making redundancies to trim costs, other banks are taking a more relaxed approach to job, salary and bonus cuts across their workforces, remuneration consultants say.
A poll in June of 75 financial firms by Pearl Meyer, a global remuneration consultant, showed 63% have neither made nor contemplated changes to bonus structures in the face of the pandemic, even though 70% expect COVID-19 to have a moderately or slightly negative impact on their businesses.
Bonus plans also come despite a regulatory frown in Britain and elsewhere on bumper cash payouts in the early days of the pandemic, as banks were urged to conserve capital. 
""These banks move broadly in lockstep, no one wants to cut anything first,"" said Simon Patterson, managing director at Pearl Meyer, which advises more than 1,000 companies on employee compensation structures annually.
Sources at two global banks said it was too early to speculate on bonus outcomes for specific units, though many traders will expect big payouts after a surge in revenue at market divisions propped up investment bank profits in the first half of the year.
Research from compensation consultant Johnson Associates this month suggested 2020 bonuses for fixed-income traders for instance could rise by more than 30% from last year.
But that will need to be balanced against performances in other units, with low interest rates and an expected rise in defaults set to hit earnings in retail and corporate banking.
""Financial markets are cyclical but what we face is so unprecedented, no one truly knows whether next year is a feast or famine,"" Patterson said.
EXTREME MODERATION 
Britain's Prudential (NYSE:PUK) Regulation Authority (PRA) banned bonus payments to top management and material risk takers at the UK's biggest deposit-taking banks when Europe's COVID-19 crisis escalated in March, meaning some top traders could miss out.
Some senior managers at  Barclays  (L:BARC), Lloyds Banking Group (L:LLOY) and NatWest Group (L:NWG) waived scheduled pay rises and took voluntary salary cuts. 
But the PRA has not made clear how long the ban will stay in place and some banks are already planning for future payouts, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) noted last month, though it urged them to align payouts with long-term business plans. 
The PRA said it will reassess firms' distribution plans beyond 2020 in the fourth quarter. 
Its assessment will be based on the current and projected capital positions of the banks and will take into account the level of economic uncertainty and market conditions at that time. 
The European Central Bank said last month that EU-regulated firms must ""adopt extreme moderation with regard to variable remuneration payments until 1 January 2021"", though this restriction ends before most EU lenders set bonuses for 2020. 
Longer-term, it encouraged banks to consider whether a larger part of variable pay could be deferred for longer or paid in other instruments rather than cash. 
A source at a major global bank said firms were reluctant to dismantle bonus structures, because doing so could deter bright graduates from applying for entry-level roles and demotivate existing staff needed to power the business through tough times. 
There may however be pressure to adapt their models, in a bid to keep costs in check and avoid a backlash over huge payouts during a recession.
HAZARD BONUSES 
Some are reducing the amount paid to new hires. Data from recruitment consultant Morgan McKinley showed the average salary rise for those moving from one UK finance job to another dropped to 15% in the first half of 2020 compared with 19.8% a year before. 
In the United States, some banks including  Popular Inc  (O:BPOP) and Associated Banc Corp have already said they will pay front-line employees more money in the form of ""hazard bonuses"" during the pandemic.
Other banks are offering non-financial rewards like extra holiday leave and other benefits to make staff feel both valued and wealthier, at little or no impact to their bottom lines, the remuneration consultants said.
Justine Woolf, director of consulting at UK-based Innecto Reward Consulting, said banks were also looking to increase bonuses to staff who helped them hit certain environmental, social and governance goals, so that payouts were more aligned with good corporate behaviour. 
""Banks want to be seen to be doing the right thing,"" Woolf said. ""That includes increasing diversity and creating a better gender profile, and bonus plans are being tweaked to incentivise managers to achieve this"".
But top risk-takers and executives were less willing to surrender the chance to take home big bonuses, she said, leading some employers to consider awarding restricted stock to appease those who could yet miss out because of regulation.

""Bankers know the score,"" said Pearl Meyer's Patterson. ""Some years they are overpaid, some years they are underpaid. It's never like Goldilock's porridge.""

Investing.com - European stock markets are set to see mixed trading Wednesday, pausing after further records on Wall Street, as investors digest recent economic data ahead of a key speech from the head of the U.S. Federal Reserve.
At 2:05 AM ET (0605 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.2% lower, the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. rose 0.1%, while CAC 40 futures in France climbed 0.1%.
Tuesday saw a mixed trading session on Wall Street, as a rare pullback in Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock hurt theDow Jones Industrial Average, which fell 60 points, or 0.2%. However, the S&P 500 gained 0.4% and the NASDAQ Compositejumped 0.8%, both settling in record territory.
Investors have been buoyed in recent days by signs of the Covid-19 virus receding and the Trump administration forcing the pace of authorizing treatments for it, as well as by progress in trade relations between the U.S. and China.
However, economic data has shown a mixed picture as far as the global recovery is concerned. 
In Europe, the German Ifo survey showed stronger-than-expected business sentiment, but consumer confidence dropped to a more than six-year low in the United States this month, data showed on Tuesday, overshadowing a boom in new home sales. 
“Renewed Covid containment measures and cuts to Federal unemployment benefits appear to be offsetting any positive boost from rising equity markets,” said analyst James Knightley at ING, in a research note. “With sentiment at its lowest point since the start of the crisis, it reinforces the view that the second phase of the recovery story will be slower going.”
With a light data calendar Wednesday, investors are looking to Thursday’s Jackson Hole symposium, where U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell is due to give a speech, for further guidance on the central bank’s monetary policy framework review.

801,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 26, 2020 02:06AM ET</span>","'All girls, buy it!' In China, Perfect Diary gives cosmetics world a makeover with live streams, low prices","By Sophie Yu and Scott Murdoch
BEIJING/HONG KONG (Reuters) - With chat groups, video streams and low prices for foundation, China's Perfect Diary has emerged from nowhere four years ago to become a cosmetics giant for the digital age, trailing only L'Oreal and LVMH in the world's no. 2 market for make-up.
The Guangzhou-based beauty unicorn is now setting its sights on a Hong Kong initial public offering (IPO). Before that, it's driving into Southeast Asia, targeting more millennial social media users like Wen Shan, a 21-year-old student from Guangdong. 
Wen has ditched Western brands like NARS and Revlon and devotes her annual budget of 3,000 yuan ($434) to Perfect Diary cosmetics like eyeshadow palettes. Most cost less than 100 yuan and are made by the same contract manufacturers that supply Western brands. 
She converted to Perfect Diary after a room-mate's tip. ""The foreign brands have a large variety of foundations that often confuses me and I can't tell which one is best on me ... The Chinese brand knows what is good for local consumers.""
Though still a global minnow compared with powerhouse L'Oreal, Perfect Diary now has 4% of the Chinese market for colour cosmetics, according to Euromonitor 2019 data. That ranks it joint third with  Estee Lauder  (NYSE:EL)'s MAC, beaten only by luxury giant LVMH's Christian Dior and three L'Oreal brands that stack up to more than 20%.
The research firm estimates the overall market more than doubled from 2015 to nearly $8 billion in 2019 - and will mushroom to almost $15 billion in 2024 as China's middle class expands.
Perfect Diary's rise has been fuelled by blending low prices and social media platforms like Douyin - TikTok for China - and WeChat, collecting customer data it can use to design and roll out new products rapidly, helped by charismatic influencers with huge online followings like 'Lipstick King' Li Jiaqi https://www.weibo.com/u/1968758563?is_all=1.
Yelling his catchphrase ""All girls, buy it!"", Li has given Perfect Diary products rave reviews in popular live streams on giant e-commerce retailer  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA)'s Taobao platform. 
Analysts said Perfect Diary's rise has been boosted by younger, 'Generation Z' consumers' willingness to embrace homegrown products. 
""Gen Z is growing up in a prosperous China,"" said Mei Xin, analyst at Huatai Securities. ""Unlike the older generation, they don't believe the moon in the West is rounder than in China.""
A spokesperson for L'Oreal in China didn't immediately respond to a request for comment on the growth of homegrown brands, but said L'Oreal typically welcomes healthy competition.
EYES ON SOUTHEAST ASIA
Founded by entrepreneur Huang Jinfeng's Yatsen E-Commerce firm in 2017 as an online, China-focused operation, the company now also has more than 150 stores in China - with a target of 200 this year - as well as international aspirations.
""Yatsen E-Commerce has always had a vision of creating a domestic beauty brand with true international influence,"" Huang told Reuters.
In recent months, it has opened its own online store for Southeast Asia countries including the Philippines, Singapore and Malaysia. It also has an official store on Lazada, Alibaba's Southeast Asia arm.
""We listen to users and we immediately carry out research on products they want,"" said Huang, citing the example of data gathered during the coronavirus pandemic that resulted in a new pressed face powder. 
""Consumers need to fix their makeup more often as the face mask takes off makeup,"" Huang said.
Perfect Diary currently uses contract manufacturers including Milan-headquartered Intercos，which has a factory in China that supplies L'Oreal and others. Since March it been building its own plant in Guangdong, due on line by end-2021. 
$500 MLN IPO, UP TO $5 BLN VALUATION?
Perfect Diary doesn't disclose financial performance or liabilities, nor say whether it's profitable.
Already backed by investors like Hillhouse Capital, Sequoia Capital, Tiger Global Management, Boyu Capital and Chinese Culture Group, Yatsen is currently raising a pre-IPO round that values it at around $4 billion, according to two people with direct knowledge of the matter. 
It has also appointed Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) to lead a Hong Kong IPO that aims to raise up to $500 million by the end of 2020, according to two separate sources. 
One person said the IPO valuation could likely reach $5 billion - big, yet dwarfed by L'Oreal's more-than-$180 billion market value.
The people declined to be named because the information was not public. Perfect Diary declined to comment on IPO plans.
Meanwhile, student Wen continues to add lipsticks and foundations to her Perfect Diary make-up kit.
""I don't care much about the originality of a brand,"" she said.

""I didn't know Perfect Diary was a Chinese brand the first time I bought it. But now I know, I have a natural good feeling about using a domestic brand.""

802,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 26, 2020 01:30AM ET</span>",Australian banks use bloated cash balances to reduce debt,"By Paulina Duran
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian banks are making the most of ample cash during the coronavirus pandemic - driven by government wage subsidies, capital raisings, and higher individual deposits - to repay their debt as part of a long-held drive to bolster finances.
As the economy benefits from fiscal and monetary stimulus, companies raising capital to secure balance sheets have deposited more funds at banks, while workers have moved retirement savings into cash early.
This has allowed Australian banks to fund loans with less debt while driving bank funding costs lower - which helps offset the hit to profits from falling yields.
The deposits in the country's banks grew nearly 12% to a record A$2.29 trillion ($1.65 trillion) in the year to June 30, official data shows, while loans only increased 3% in the same period, creating excess liquidity.
""The banks are flush with cash,"" said Brad Scott, head of debt capital markets at Bank of China in Sydney.
In the four months since the COVID-19 outbreak, banks have accumulated about A$145 billion of excess deposits, and about A$95 billion of more costly term debt has been repaid, according to  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C).
At the Commonwealth Bank (AX:CBA), which finances one in every four home loans in the country, 74% of the bank's loans were funded by deposits in the year to June, up from 69% a year earlier, while smaller peers are also relying on less debt for funding, their accounts show.
Unusually, the big four banks, which hold over 80% of all deposits, have not had to issue senior bonds since February. Ample demand amidst the dearth of issuance from big banks is pushing their credit spreads over the benchmark rate to near record lows.
Banks would only have to offer about half of the 80-to-90 basis point spread historically offered to issue 5-year debt, based on secondary bond prices.
""If they were to issue a bond, notionally they would price around that level, the question is whether they do need that money (at all), even at the cheaper level,"" Scott added.
Banks also have access to an extra A$154 billion three-year funding facility priced at only 0.25% from the central bank.
Investors meanwhile are buying bonds from non-financial firms like local retailer Coles Group (AX:COL) and electricity distributor Ausgrid to safeguard balance sheets, which in turn end up as deposits at banks.
Overall, analysts say the huge liquidity, combined with the low funding rates, are a net negative for banks because they are not earning much out of the cash.
It is ""only a small benefit because the available spread on those deposits is shrinking,"" said Matthew Wilson, a senior banking analyst at Evans and Partners.

Investing.com – Hangzhou, China-based e-commerce giant Ant Group has lodged its application for a dual listing in Hong Kong and Shanghai.
The filings did not specify a share price range nor the amount the company hopes to raise. But proceeds will be used to expand cross-border payments, as well as enhancing research and development.
Ant has lined up a stellar list of advisors for the offerings, with  Citigroup  (NYSE:C), JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM),  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), and China International Capital Corp advising on the Hong Kong offering.  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) is also part of the team as a joint global coordinator. Meanwhile, CICC and CSC Financial Co are leading the Shanghai listing.
The company is hoping to raise CNY48 billion ($6.94 billion) in this portion. A successful listing could see the dual listing potentially top Saudi Aramco’s $29 billion offering in 2019, which still holds the record for the biggest global debut in recent years.
Part of Jack Ma’s  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group (HK:9988), which holds a 33% stake, Ant is evolving into an online shopping mall offering products as diverse as loans, travel services and food delivery as it competes for consumers with rival Tencent Holdings Ltd (HK:0700). With Ant’s Alipay app boasting around a billion users, Ant is looking to expand into financial services, and artificial intelligence.
The filings also highlighted U.S.-China tensions, with U.S. export controls and trade sanctions posing the biggest expansion risks to the company. The tensions also led to Ant deciding against a U.S. listing over increased U.S. scrutiny of Chinese companies listed in U.S stock exchanges.
Alibaba’s Hong Kong shares rose 3.57% to HK$278.80 ($35.97) by 1:14 AM ET (6:14 AM GMT)."

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Ant Group's planned sale of up to $30 billion worth of shares is set to revive fortunes for Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Ltd (HKEX) which fell to fifth rank as a destination for initial public offerings (IPOs) in the first half of 2020.
China's dominant mobile payments firm and fintech arm of  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd on Tuesday filed for a dual-listing in Hong Kong and on Shanghai's STAR Market in what could be the world's largest IPO.
The IPO comes as Beijing's imposition of a security law in Hong Kong and Washington's consequent termination of some agreements with the territory has triggered questions about Hong Kong's future as a financial hub.
Hong Kong was the world's top listing venue in 2019, due to Alibaba's $12.9 billion secondary listing there, but ranked third for IPOs, Refinitiv data showed. It was top for IPOs in 2018.
For IPOs in the first half 2020, Hong Kong fell to fifth behind the Nasdaq, New York Stock Exchange, the year-old STAR Market and the broader Shanghai Stock Exchange.
Few large-sized IPOs are in the pipeline for rest of the year at Hong Kong's rival bourses.
TECH ADVANCE
Ant has not disclosed how much it expects to raise in each of its Hong Kong and Shanghai offerings.
""Hong Kong provides access to international institutional investors and convertible currency, whereas Shanghai may allow broad participation by domestic investors,"" said Drew Bernstein, co-chairman of advisory Marcum Bernstein & Pinchuk.
Technology companies account for 25.1% of Hong Kong's benchmark Hang Seng Index by value, Hong Kong Stock Exchange (HKEX) data showed, from just 8.6% in 2015.
""The Hong Kong market is changing and internet giants are increasingly replacing property companies and financial institutions,"" said capital markets consultant Philippe Espinasse.

HKEX declined to comment on Ant's listing. When Ant announced its plans on July 20, HKEX Chief Executive Charles Li said the deal would affirm Hong Kong ""as the world's leading international IPO market"".

806,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 25, 2020 09:30PM ET</span>","No funds available: Depositors at India's PMC Bank survive on loans, charity","By Abhirup Roy and Aditya Kalra
MUMBAI/NEW DELHI (Reuters) - In February, 82-year-old Kishan Lal appealed to India's finance minister for help, saying in a Twitter message he was ready to donate his kidney and eyes if someone could help arrange funds to treat his daughter, who had a brain tumour.
The Lals had enough savings to tide over the medical crisis - more than 2.5 million rupees ($33,450) in Punjab & Maharashtra Co-operative (PMC) Bank. But withdrawals were capped at 50,000 rupees from each account at the time because authorities were investigating fraud at PMC.
The withdrawal cap is now at 100,000 rupees per depositor.
""I just borrowed money from wherever I could, I had to save my daughter,"" said Lal. ""If I had access to my own money, I'd not have been ashamed.""
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) took control of PMC last September after it was accused of fraud and concealing non-performing loans. PMC's top officials and the owners of a realty company that received the bulk of the loans were arrested.
The withdrawal cap has left many of PMC's over 900,000 depositors in deep difficulty. Some say they are struggling to clear loans or pay their children's school fees, while others say they depend on friends for their groceries. 
The situation at PMC has also amplified concerns about the health of India's tens of thousands of co-operative banks, which often serve communities in the rural interior and have assets worth around $220 billion, about 11% of India's total banking sector assets. 
These banks, many of which are tiny, are subject to less stringent regulation than commercial banks and currently, more than two dozen of them are facing lending or withdrawal restrictions by the RBI because of financial irregularities.
The coronavirus has hit the broader banking sector hard, raising concerns about soaring bad loans as household and corporate debt rise. Liquidity risks have increased for non-bank financial companies and the state banking system needs to be recapitalised. 
But some analysts are concerned that the pandemic is likely to have a more pronounced effect on the fragile co-operative banks.
""They lend to riskier borrowers who have higher chances of defaulting due to the pandemic,"" said Jignesh Shial, a banking analyst at brokerage Emkay Global. 
Asked about the delay in resolving PMC's problems, Jai Bhagwan Bhoria, an administrator appointed by the RBI to revive the bank, told Reuters: ""The recovery is an ongoing process and it takes time in actual realisations due to legal steps and hurdles faced."" 
TALE OF TWO LENDERS 
The PMC crisis has also sparked courtroom battles. In one of them, Sandeep Bhalla, whose parents have nearly 10 million rupees blocked in PMC, has told the Delhi High Court that depositors of PMC were ""discriminated against"" compared to those from commercial lender Yes Bank.
In March, the RBI imposed a cap of 50,000 rupees on withdrawals from Yes Bank, then India's fifth-largest bank in terms of assets, after its finances deteriorated.
But less than 24 hours later, the finance minister announced that India's top state-run bank, SBI, would infuse funds into Yes Bank and the withdrawal curbs were subsequently lifted.
The finance ministry told the court the government had not infused any funds in Yes Bank but it was investors and the SBI who came to its rescue, according to court documents. SBI is 57% government owned. 
The judge wasn't convinced. 
Noting PMC depositors were in a ""dire state"", the court said the RBI and the finance ministry played a crucial role in rescuing Yes Bank and asked them both to ""delve into the aspect"" of why PMC depositors were differently treated.
The RBI told the court the two lenders were ""fundamentally different,"" including the different regulations governing them. It also said with PMC's ""really precarious financials"", no investors were willing to bail it out.
The finance ministry submitted that the RBI had rescued Yes Bank as it found it necessary in the public and depositors' interest, but the central bank had not proposed any such rescue for PMC.
The court is next set to hear the case in mid-September, just ahead of the first anniversary of PMC's collapse. 
Asked for further comment, the finance ministry referred Reuters questions to the RBI, which did not respond. 
""GET WELL SOON RBI""
Set up in 1984, PMC is a regional lender with 137 branches across six states and by last year it had deposits of $1.5 billion. Yes Bank is far bigger with more than 1,000 branches across India.
Many depositors said they were unaware of the differing regulatory structures for banks, and believed PMC was like any other commercial lender.
""If it was not safe, why did you name it a bank?"" asked Pooja Chaudhary, 26, who said she had to struggle for hours last month to get custody of her father's body after a hospital refused to release it until she cleared medical bills. 
""My father died, and I couldn't even cry,"" said Chaudhary, whose said her savings of 1.5 million rupees were blocked in PMC.
Earlier this month, dozens of PMC depositors organised a protest in Mumbai and shouted slogans against the central bank.
""Get well soon RBI. Thanks for doing your job so well that we lost all our life savings,"" read one poster.
On Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), depositors regularly post videos and photos to amplify their request for help. Each day, hundreds of messages are shared on a Telegram messaging app group of about 4,000 members where depositors discuss next steps, or simply vent.
Kishan Lal and his daughter Bony say they remain at the mercy of loans. Lal said he has developed a prostate problem but is not treating it, and is skipping his regular blood-pressure medicines as savings remain blocked at PMC. 

Bony, 43, is distraught while battling her own illnesses. ""It is our hard-earned tax-paid money,"" she said, ""and we are having to literally beg for it.""

(Reuters) - Palantir Technologies on Tuesday filed to go public through a direct listing, as the data analytics company known for working with the Central Intelligence Agency and other government groups prepares for one of the biggest market debuts of the year.
The company, which was founded in 2003 by a group including Donald Trump backer Peter Thiel, unveiled losses that are set to test the appetite of capital market investors who have in recent years shown an increasing wariness of backing loss-making startups, most notably WeWork, which botched its IPO last year.
The move to lift the lid on its business for the first time marked a major moment for Palantir, which is widely seen as one of the most reclusive companies in Silicon Valley. 
The company reported a net loss of about $580 million in 2019, about the same as its loss in 2018. Revenue came in at $742 million last year, compared to $595 million in 2018. (https:// For the first six months of 2020, the company posted revenue of $481 million, up 49% from the year-earlier period. In June, Reuters reported, citing sources, the company expects revenue in 2020 to grow to $1 billion. ""Notwithstanding losses, its business model continues to leverage off existing clients by offering more value through better data on longer duration contracts,"" said Matt Novak, managing partner at All Blue Capital, a Palantir investor. The Thiel-backed firm had confidentially filed to go public in July. As opposed to a traditional initial public offering, a direct listing does not raise fresh funds. In a direct-listing model, existing investors get to sell their shares. Palantir, which derives its name from a magical artifact in ""The Lord of the Rings"", specializes in analyzing large quantities of data. The company is widely seen as a tech firm with a rebellious streak in Silicon Valley, with its recent decision to move its headquarters to Denver. ""Our company was founded in Silicon Valley. But we seem to share fewer and fewer of the technology sector's values and commitments,"" Palantir said in its filing. Thiel, known for his tech investing credentials as a co-founder of PayPal and  Facebook Inc 's (O:FB) first major investor, is the chairman of Palantir, with fellow co-founder Alexander Karp the current chief executive officer. Thiel was also an early investor in LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) and part of the so-called ""Paypal Mafia"" in Silicon Valley, referring to a group of highly successful entrepreneurs who went on to start and invest in prominent tech startups. 
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS),  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) are among the financial advisers for Palantir's listing.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Gary Cohn, the former economic adviser to U.S. President Donald Trump, has teamed up with investor Clifton S. Robbins to seek $600 million in an initial public offering (IPO) for a new blank-check acquisition company, filings showed on Tuesday. 
Cohn is the latest high-profile name to join the frenzy of Wall Street dealmaking related to special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs). 
SPACs were considered a banking backwater a decade ago but have emerged in 2020 as one of the most active areas on Wall Street, driven by splashy deals for the likes of space tourism company Virgin Galactic Holdings (NYSE:SPCE) Inc and fantasy sports and gambling company DraftKings (NASDAQ:DKNG) Inc.
High-profile financiers such as Bill Ackman, Michael Klein and Chamath Palihapitiya as well as former U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan are among the sponsors for SPAC IPOs in 2020. 
A SPAC is a shell company that raises money through an IPO to buy an unspecified operating company to then take public, usually within two years.
Cohn's SPAC, Cohn Robbins Holdings Corp, will look to sell 60 million units in an IPO at $10 apiece, and list on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol ""CRHC.U"".
The SPAC had previously been on file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commision under the name CSR Acquisition Corp and had planned to raise $300 million. 
Cohn had been in talks with Robbins for the past month or so about joining the SPAC, according to a person familiar with the matter. 
Formerly president and chief operating officer of  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS), Cohn served in the Trump White House for a little more than a year and was a driver of the administration's tax overhaul enacted in 2017. 
Robbins had told clients in February he was shuttering his investment firm, Blue Harbour Group, to do something different.

 Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) is the sole book-running manager on the Cohn Robbins Holdings IPO.

809,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 25, 2020 07:35PM ET</span>","GM, Ford coronavirus U.S. ventilator projects close in on their finish lines","By Joseph White
DETROIT (Reuters) - General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) and Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co said on Tuesday they are close to completing production of ventilators ordered by the Trump Administration in response to the surge in coronavirus cases, and are ramping down or exiting the operations.
Many of the ventilators assembled by the automakers and other manufacturers have gone into a U.S. government stockpile as doctors shifted away from using invasive ventilators with COVID-19 patients. The government currently has 108,000 ventilators in its medical equipment stockpile, and 12,000 deployed at U.S. hospitals, the U.S. Health and Human Services department said Tuesday.
GM and medical equipment maker Ventec Life Systems are in the ""home stretch"" toward completing a contract to deliver 30,000 critical care ventilators by the end of August under a $489 million contract with the federal government, the automaker said. 
GM and Ventec have already delivered more than 20,000 machines, GM spokesman Jim Cain said.
Ford has assembled about 47,000 of the 50,000 ventilators it agreed to supply to partner  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Co, Ford spokeswoman Rachel McCleery said. GE has a $336 million contract with the government.
HHS said it has received more than 69,000 ventilators assembled by GM and Ford and their partners, and ""both of these delivery schedules are nearly complete.""
Ford and GM earlier this year said they would employ a total of as many as 1,500 people on ventilator assembly lines. Automakers likened the efforts to their switch from making cars to tanks and planes during the Second World War.
With North American car and truck factories back in operation, the Detroit automakers are winding down their forays into ventilator manufacturing, but continuing to make respiratory masks.
GM has said it plans to transfer the ventilator-making operations at a factory in Kokomo, Indiana, to its partner Ventec on Sept.1. Union-represented GM workers employed at the plant will return to the automaker, and temporary workers will remain with Ventec.
Ford transferred full-time workers who were building ventilators back to their home plants in May, and the majority of the temporary workers still assembling ventilators will have opportunities to land jobs building the new Ford Bronco SUV at a factory near Detroit, a company spokeswoman said Tuesday.
The automakers' efforts to build ventilators and other medical equipment were launched in a politically charged atmosphere as the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic swamped the U.S. economy and healthcare system. The shortage of ventilators became a symbol of the nation's struggle to respond. 
U.S. President Donald Trump put pressure on the automakers as part of a broader push to secure more than 130,000 ventilators by the end of 2020.
The automakers used the medical equipment assembly operations set up in the spring to test safety protocols they later used to reopen their vehicle-making operations.

(Reuters) -  Nordstrom Inc  (N:JWN) reported a bigger-than-expected loss on Tuesday, as the COVID-19 pandemic shut its stores for about half of the reported quarter and consumers stayed home with little need for designer clothes.
Shares of the upscale department store chain were trading down roughly 5% after the bell.
Like many of its peers, Nordstrom suffered from a pandemic-induced months-long closure of its stores across the United States, bringing foot traffic to a standstill. Shoppers staying home to curb the spread of the virus, didn't find themselves purchasing as much upscale apparel and formal work attire.
""We're confident that we can improve sales trends in the second half of the year and beyond,"" said Pete Nordstrom, president and chief brand officer of Nordstrom.
""Our inventories are current and in-line, and we're focused on amplifying relevant categories, brands and trends to meet customers' changing preferences.""
The pandemic has drastically changed how and where people shop, with many choosing to spend their dollars on sweatpants or ""joggers,"" sports bras and basics.
Nordstrom's bottom line also took a hit after the retailer moved its popular Anniversary Sale from the second to the third quarter. The move affected its online sales, which fell 5%.
""Digital sales were down, which is surprising,"" said Sucharita Kodali, retail analyst at  Forrester Research  (NASDAQ:FORR). ""They (Nordstrom) said the Anniversary Sale switch hurt them, but even then dot com sales were only up 20% while others were seeing 100%+ ecommerce growth.""
With millions still unemployed, 'essential,' lower-price retailers like Walmart (N:WMT) and  Target  (N:TGT) are seeing record boosts in online sales across most categories, including apparel.
Looking forward to the all-important winter holiday season, Nordstrom executives said the firm would join other retailers in ""bringing in gift offerings before Thanksgiving.""
Nordstrom would continue to refine its marketing strategy and invest in top performing categories like home, active and wellness, they told investors on a post-earnings conference call.
Seattle-based Nordstrom reported a net loss of $255 million, or $1.62 per share, compared with a profit of $141 million, or 90 cents per share, a year earlier. 
Analysts had expected a loss of $1.48 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

Total revenue fell 52% to $1.86 billion, missing Wall Street estimates of $2.38 billion.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A contentious new fee on U.S. mortgage refinancings has been delayed until Dec. 1, according to the regulator overseeing mortgage giants Fannie Mae and  Freddie Mac  (OTC:FMCC).
The 0.5% fee, aimed at recouping potentially billions of dollars in losses created by the coronavirus pandemic, was originally set to take effect on Sept. 1. The regulator, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, also said the fee would not apply to mortgages worth less than $125,000.
Fannie and Freddie had announced the fee earlier this month amid a boom in refinancings as borrowers looked to take advantage of record-low interest rates. 
But the new fee was met with swift criticism by the banking industry, consumer groups and members of Congress, who were wary of what the new cost could mean for struggling borrowers and the entire housing market during such a tumultuous economic time.
The FHFA said the pair, bailed out by the government during the 2008 financial crisis, were facing at least $6 billion in pandemic-driven losses, including through forebearance and other relief programs. FHFA Director Mark Calabria has said one of his top priorities was boosting capital at the enterprises as part of a bid to return them to the private market as soon as possible.

The delay could give Congress time to come up with other ways to help boost the pair's finances before the fee takes effect, according to agency officials.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 closed at a record high for a second straight day Tuesday, as tech continued to flex its muscles, shrugging off weakness in Apple and data showing an unexpected decline in consumer confidence.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.21% or 59 points. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite rose 0.36% and 0.76% respectively to close at all-time highs.
The Conference Board’s consumer confidence gauge unexpectedly fell to 84.8 this month from 91.7 in July, missing economists’ forecast for a reading of 93.
""The drop in confidence this month is disappointing. We had expected to see a better reading based on the fact that the second surge of COVID in the Sun Belt is abating and the worst outcomes seem to be avoided,"" Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) said.
But the drop ""suggests that the expiration of the $600 enhanced unemployment insurance benefits really took a bite out of confidence,"" it added.
The move lower in the broader market was exacerbated by a fall in energy stocks, paced by a 3% decline in Exxon (NYSE:XOM) Mobile after the oil major was booted out of the Dow Jones Industrial Average following a re-weighting of the index.
The fall in energy was kept in check somewhat by a rise in oil prices as oversupply worries eased because energy companies cut production in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico to limit damage from Hurricane Laura, which is expected to make landfall over the next few days.
Tech advance as gains in Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) offset a fall in Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).

824,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 25, 2020 03:45PM ET</span>",Gulf Coast Refineries Rush to Shutter Plants As Laura Nears,"(Bloomberg) -- Oil and chemical facilities located along the Texas and Louisiana coasts are racing to shutter plants as Hurricane Laura settles on a course to rip through the nation’s energy corridor this week.
Some of the largest U.S. refineries are shutting in advance of Laura, affecting nearly 3 million barrels a day of capacity along the U.S. Gulf Coast, according to a Bloomberg calculation. That’s about one third of the Gulf Coast refining capacity, according to figures from Lipow Oil Associates. More than 84% of oil production and nearly 61% of natural gas production has been taken offline, according to the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement.
READ: Storm Laura Set to Slam U.S. Energy Coast as a Major Hurricane
Gasoline prices surged on the disruptions and concern that Laura could approach a level of destruction not seen since Hurricane Harvey in 2017. Gasoline futures jumped for a second day in a row, rallying by as much as 5.3% after notching the biggest one-day climb since May on Monday. Prices were also trading at the highest since before the Covid-19 pandemic sent demand spiraling in early March.
“From a refining standpoint, it’s not as bad as what happened during Harvey,” said Andy Lipow, president at consultancy Lipow Oil Associates, though that could change depending on the strength of the storm. However, this time any supply disruptions would be occurring in a vastly different market because of the pandemic. “Refiners are operating at about 80% utilization,” he said. “That means refiners who aren’t impacted by the storm can pick up” any slack in supply. He added that gasoline inventories are also slightly higher versus a year ago, with diesel stocks much higher.
Motiva Enterprises LLC, which operates the largest refinery in the U.S., is shutting both its 607,000 barrel-a-day oil refinery and chemical plant in Port Arthur, Texas, according to people familiar with the matter and a regulatory filing. A Motiva official could not be reached for comment.  Valero Energy  Corp (NYSE:VLO). is also shutting its 335,000 barrel-a-day Port Arthur facility. Total SE said it was starting an orderly shutdown of its 225,500 barrel-a-day refinery there.
The city of Port Arthur and Jefferson County have issued a mandatory evacuation for some residents, government officials urged some residents of Houston’s eastern suburbs to leave their homes.
Meanwhile,  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM). has started shutting down both its 560,500 barrel-a-day Baytown refinery and 369,000 barrel-a-day Beaumont refinery. Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX) is shutting its 260,000 barrel-a-day Lake Charles refinery. Delek US Holdings’ 80,000 barrel-a-day Krotz Springs refinery had been shut due to a boiler issue and would remain down because of the hurricane, according to a person familiar. Citgo Petroleum Corp is also shutting its 418,000 barrel-a-day Lake Charles refinery, according to sources.
Calcasieu Refining Co’s 135,500 barrel-a-day refinery in Lake Charles is also shut, though it happened earlier this month due to low demand.
If past weather events are any indication, says Robert Yawger, director of energy futures at Mizuho Securities USA LLC, offshore platforms will be the first to resume production after the storm passes. Refineries, which require more people to operate than a platform, will depend on how quickly everyone can get back to work.

825,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 25, 2020 03:15PM ET</span>",Honda Motor units to pay $85 million to settle U.S. states' probe over Takata air bags,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Units of Honda Motor Co (T:7267) have agreed to pay $85 million to settle an investigation by most U.S. states into its use of defective Takata airbag inflators in its vehicles, according to a consent order made public on Tuesday.
The state probes are connected with the ongoing recalls of tens of millions of vehicles equipped with potentially defective Takata inflators that were sold by Honda and other major auto manufacturers over the past 20 years.
To date, more than 40 million U.S. vehicles equipped with 60 million defective Takata air bags have been recalled because the inflators can explode when deployed, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. At least 25 deaths around the world and nearly 300 injuries have been linked to faulty Takata inflators.
Worldwide, the Takata recalls cover about 100 million inflators among 19 major automakers, including Honda.
In January, Honda said it would recall an additional 2.7 million older U.S. vehicles in North America for potentially defective Takata inflators. That recall covers Honda and Acura automobiles from the 1996 through 2003 model years.
Honda said it was aware of one field rupture of an inflator in the new recall campaign - a 2012 crash in Texas that resulted in an injury - and two in junk yards in Japan.
In the settlement announced Tuesday, American Honda Motor Co and Honda of America agreed to upgrade their product safety procedures related to frontal airbags, including to reduce the risk that their inflators could rupture.
The Honda affiliates agreed to the consent order without admitting wrongdoing and to avoid the cost of further litigation, the automaker said. Court approval is required.
Honda confirmed it had reached civil settlements with 46 U.S. states, Washington, D.C. and three U.S. territories over the matter. 
Since 2008, Honda has recalled nearly 13 million U.S. vehicles equipped with Takata inflators, and has replaced more than 16 million inflators.

A multistate group of attorneys general had been investigating Honda's use of Takata airbags since December 2015, according to the consent order.

The plan, approved by a Virginia federal court, will equitize over $1.6 billion of secured debt, and provide for $400 million in asset-based loan as well as $400 million of fresh financial aid. 
The New York-based chain, known for preppy clothing at times worn by former first lady Michelle Obama, filed for bankruptcy earlier this year and was soon joined by peers such as Neiman Marcus Group, J.C. Penney Co Inc, Brooks Brothers. 
The company was pressured by the virus outbreak to temporarily close its nearly 500 J. Crew, J. Crew Factory and Madewell stores, and also shelve its plans for an initial public offering of its Madewell business.

In 2011, J. Crew was taken private by TPG and Leonard Green & Partners in a roughly $3 billion leveraged buyout. Years later in 2017, the retailer avoided bankruptcy in a deal with creditors that reduced total debt and pushed due dates on obligations.

It's one of the food chains that has most been disrupted by the coronavirus spread and subsequent stay-at-home order, said Stifel analyst Chris O'Cull, upgrading the stock to buy from hold, Benzinga reported. He upped his price target to $90 from $78. Shares have two buy ratings, 14 holds and no sells, according to data compiled by Investing.com.
Management has implemented quick and aggressive steps after breakfast sales dropped, cities emptied out and tourists stayed closer to home, O'Cull said. Starbucks has improved its drive-through locations, store layouts, and digital order and payment options. 
""In our view, investors should look for companies willing and able to innovate quickly to address the challenges of the current environment,"" O'Cull wrote in a note, according to Benzinga. ""Despite its size, Starbucks has been able to accomplish this feat better than almost anyone in the restaurant industry.""

Harris County Judge Lina Hidalgo issued the voluntary evacuation order on Tuesday for low-lying areas close to Galveston Bay and the Houston Ship Channel, including towns such as Deer Park, Seabrook and Baytown. The fourth-largest U.S. city’s eastern suburbs are a warren of chemical plants, oil refineries and heavy industry.
Mayor Sylvester Turner said residents should be off the highways no later than 8 p.m. local time Wednesday and warned them to brace for widespread power outages. Impacts from Laura are forecast to begin reaching the region earlier in the day.
Houstonians should prepare “as if there’s going to be a lot of people without power,” some for extended periods, Turner said during a joint media briefing with Hidalgo.
A storm shelter has been established at the George R. Brown Convention Center in downtown Houston that will house displaced residents and also serve as a distribution center for moving some people to other facilities, Turner said.
The plan is to use city buses to transport some residents to outlying facilities operated by the Red Cross and others so that social-distancing standards can be maintained, the mayor added.

News of the layoffs came as Wirecard's demise amid an accounting scandal entered a new phase, with the official opening of insolvency proceedings on Tuesday.
Michael Jaffe, the insolvency administrator, said ""far-reaching"" cuts were needed to keep Wirecard's core business operational.
The company is laying off around 730 staff, while retaining 570 at its base in Aschheim, Germany. 
The three remaining board members whose contracts were terminated included Chief Executive James Fries, who joined Wirecard only recently to succeed Markus Braun, who remains in custody.
""The economic situation of Wirecard AG (OTC:WCAGY) was and is extremely difficult in light of the lack of liquidity and the well-known scandalous circumstances,"" Jaffe said.
Wirecard was a rising star in corporate Germany, earning a spot as one of 30 blue chips, but in a dramatic fall from grace, Wirecard filed for insolvency owing creditors 4 billion euros ($4.73 billion) after disclosing a 1.9 billion euro hole in its accounts.
Prosecutors suspect Wirecard executives of masterminding a criminal racket to fake the company's accounts and defraud creditors of billions of euros.
Jaffe is working to sell Wirecard's global assets. The first deal to sell its operations in Brazil was agreed last week.

SEATTLE (Reuters) - Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co said on Tuesday it aims to redo its unmanned Starliner crew capsule flight test to the International Space Station (ISS) in December or January, depending on when it completes software and test hardware production development. 
If the test mission is successful, Boeing and NASA will fly Starliner's first crewed mission in summer 2021, with a post-certification mission roughly scheduled for the following winter, the company added.
Boeing is eager for another shot at proving its crew capsule after technical failures put the aerospace juggernaut behind Elon Musk's rocket company SpaceX, which successfully returned its rival crew capsule from the ISS earlier this month.
During Boeing's first uncrewed test, in December 2019, a series of software glitches and an issue with the spacecraft's automated timer resulted in Starliner failing to dock at the space station and returning to Earth a week early.
In February, a NASA safety review panel found Boeing had narrowly missed a ""catastrophic failure"" in the botched test, and recommended examining the company's software verification process before letting it fly humans to space.

Earlier this month, Boeing watched from the sidelines as SpaceX's Crew Dragon capsule splashed down in the Gulf of Mexico after a two-month voyage to the International Space Station - NASA's first crewed mission from home soil in nine years.

836,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 25, 2020 12:40PM ET</span>","Canada has effectively moved to block China's Huawei from 5G, but can't say so","By David Ljunggren
OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada is the only member of the Five Eyes intelligence-sharing network that has not formally blocked Huawei from 5G networks, but it has effectively done just that, delaying a decision long enough to force telecom companies to exclude the Chinese gear maker.
The strategy allows Canada to keep on the right side of both China and the United States as they tussle over Huawei Technologies Co Ltd, say six well-placed sources with direct knowledge of the matter.
Canada and its Five Eyes allies -- the United Kingdom, New Zealand and Australia -- are under pressure from fellow member the United States to squeeze out Huawei on security grounds.
5G networks offer data speeds up to 50 or 100 times faster than 4G networks and are expected to power everything from telemedicine and remote surgery to self-driving cars. 
Canada has been mulling whether to disbar the firm's next-generation equipment for the better part of two years, brushing off increasing signs of industry impatience.
In June, Bell Canada (TO:BCE) and rival Telus Corp (TO:T) - two of the biggest wireless providers - teamed with Sweden's Ericsson (ST:ERICb) and Finland's Nokia Oyj (HE:NOKIA) to build fifth-generation (5G) telecoms networks, ditching Huawei for the project despite using Huawei 4G gear.
""The absence of a solution will eventually settle all problems,"" said a source directly familiar with the approach taken by the Liberal government of Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.
Rogers (NYSE:ROG) Communications Inc (TO:RCIb), Canada's other large wireless operator, announced in 2018 it was using Ericsson 5G equipment.
Earlier this month, the Trump administration said it would further tighten U.S. restrictions on Huawei, aimed at cracking down on its access to commercially available chips.
Operators in Canada feel the U.S. curbs mean they have no choice but to sideline Huawei in 5G networks, at least for now, say the sources, who requested anonymity given the sensitivity of the situation.
""They've done the political calculus and said 'The best thing for us is to do nothing and if we do nothing we don't upset the Chinese, we don't upset the Americans',"" said a source familiar with what government officials are saying.
Staying on the right side of China has become an important consideration. Huawei Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou is fighting extradition to the United States since Canadian police detained her in December 2018.
In response, Beijing arrested Canadian citizens Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig, charging them with espionage. Canada says gaining their freedom is a top priority.
""If it weren't for the two Michaels, Canada would have already said it would not be using Huawei 5G technology,"" a diplomatic source said. Government officials deny the fate of the two men is linked to 5G.
In 2018, both Australia and New Zealand blocked service providers from using Huawei 5G equipment.
To be sure, Canada will one day make a decision. Two other people who have consulted with Canadian officials say they think it is only a matter of time before Ottawa unveils a ban.
But a source directly familiar with government thinking stressed that Ottawa had not yet come to a firm conclusion and would not be rushed, adding that officials were taking their time to avoid Britain's predicament.
The British government said last month it would ban Huawei from 5G networks by ordering companies to remove the equipment by 2027. In January, it had initially said Huawei could have a limited 5G role.
""That underscores why you need to get this right and why you only get one chance ... we don't want to find ourselves in a situation like the Brits where we're having to go back and put the toothpaste back in the tube,"" said the source.
The office of Canada Innovation Minister Navdeep Bains - who is formally charged with making a decision on Huawei and 5G - said in a statement that it could not comment on a particular company. It did not say when an announcement would be made.
A Bell spokesman noted that in May, Chief Executive Officer Mirko Bibic said he had no insights into government thinking on Huawei and 5G. Telus did not respond to a request for comment.

Huawei said in a statement that it believed Ottawa ""when it says it is taking the time to make a considered decision"".

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers on Monday gave Northern Dynasty 90 days to explain how it would offset ""unavoidable adverse impacts"" to more than 3,200 acres (1,295 hectares) of wetlands were the mine to be developed.
Late on Monday, Alaska's U.S. Senators Dan Sullivan and Lisa Murkowski, both Republicans, came out against the mine, saying it could cause significant damage to the state's Bristol Bay region popular for fishing and hunting.
Murkowski is the powerful chair of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee and her opposition is likely to carry weight across U.S. federal agencies.
Other prominent Republicans, including Donald Trump Jr., son of President Donald Trump and a keynote speaker on Monday at the Republican National Convention, have opposed the project, saying it would destroy areas where they enjoy fishing and hunting.
Northern Dynasty, in response to the Army Corps, said it plans to ""preserve enough land so that multiples of the number of impacted wetland acres are preserved,"" but its shares still fell more than 40% on Monday.
The potential cost of such a mitigation plan is unknown and thus concerning, Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Mike Kozak said in research note. ""It will be exceptionally challenging to reach a compensation plan ... that will satisfy all parties,"" he said.
Cantor Fitzgerald put its price target and stock rating for the company under review, effectively saying it is not immediately clear how much the company is worth.
The Army Corps deadline likely means any final permit decision would come after the Nov. 3 U.S. presidential election. A victory by Democrat Joe Biden would likely to scuttle the entire project, TD Securities analyst Craig Hutchinson said.
Northern Dynasty did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Doubts about the project have steadily risen in recent months.  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS), once one of the largest Northern Dynasty shareholders, sold most of its holdings two months ago, according to regulatory disclosures.

839,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 25, 2020 12:01PM ET</span>",U.S. bank profits down 70% from year prior on coronavirus uncertainty,"By Pete Schroeder
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. bank profits were down 70% from a year prior in the second quarter of 2020 on continued economic uncertainty driven by the coronavirus pandemic, a regulator reported Tuesday.
Bank profits remained small as firms build up cushions to guard against future losses and business and consumer activity dropped, according to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Bank deposits climbed by over $1 trillion for the second straight quarter, and the regulator said the industry has ""very strong"" capital and liquidity levels.
Tuesday's report marks the second straight quarter that banks have seen their profits reduced to a fraction of record levels they experienced in 2019. The FDIC similarly reported a 70% decline in profits in the first quarter of 2020, although industry profits were actually up slightly in the second quarter.
Banks continued to set aside huge amounts of cash to guard against future loan losses -- in the second quarter firms reported a 382% increase from a year prior in how much they had reserved for potential credit losses.
The FDIC reported that the level of loans that are more than 90 days past due had risen 16% in the last quarter, driven primarily by mortgages and small business loans.
The FDIC said banks were buoyed by an uptick in commercial and industry loans, thanks in large part to the over $480 billion in forgiveable loans banks issued under the Paycheck Protection Program, a major part of Washington's attempt to help small businesses weather the pandemic. 

With economic activity grinding to a halt in many parts of the country, banks reported their second straight quarter of over $1 trillion in new deposits. The ""unprecedented"" influx of funds actually meant the deposit insurance fund run by the FDIC dropped below its legal minimum ratio of 1.35 percent. FDIC Chairman Jelena McWilliams said in a statement she expects that fund, which banks pay into, will return to sufficient levels in the coming months without having to charge the industry a higher percentage to boost it.

South Africa's Treasury said in June it would inject 3 billion rand into The Land and Agricultural Bank of South Africa, the country's largest agricultural focused-lender, which had been in talks with creditors on a restructuring plan following the default.
However Land Bank said in a statement that Standard Chartered had since launched legal proceedings to recover some of the money, earlier in August. 
""Land Bank is working with its advisers and will be opposing the application,"" it said, adding it was continuing to work with creditors towards a solution. 
Standard Chartered declined to comment.

The French luxury company was set to close the $16.2 billion deal with the U.S. brand on Monday, but a source familiar told Reuters they will give themselves another three months.
LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE (PA:LVMH) agreed to buy Tiffany last year, and the terms of the deal allow one of the parties to push the deadline back to Nov. 24. Tiffany is exercising that option, according to the source, Reuters reported. The European Union has yet to approve the deal.     
Tiffany is scheduled to report earnings on Wednesday, and analysts estimate earnings per share of 19 cents on revenue of $794 million. In June, it published results showing a loss per share of 53 cents compared to the expected earnings per share of 1 cent on sales of $555 million, versus the estimated $692 million. 
In the second quarter, LVMH revenue was down 38% compared to the same period in 2019, with the U.S. and Europe seeing notably lower sales. Asia has seen an improvement in trends, with a strong rebound in China in particular, the company said in a statement.

Investing.com -- American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) will cut 19,000 jobs in October, bringing the total to about 40,000 people who are leaving the company. 
Shares dropped almost 4% on Tuesday. Delta Air Lines Inc (NYSE:DAL) fell 1% and United Airlines Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:UAL) was down 4%.
The cuts amount to a 28% reduction from American's March employment level of 140,000, Forbes said. 
The 19,000 positions will be involuntary furloughs or separations on Oct. 1, the day after the expiration of emergency funding under the CARES Act, though there is still hope that Congress will extend the payroll support program, which is backed by both parties.    
In addition to the 19,000 involuntary layoffs on Oct. 1, about 12,500 employees have retired or accepted early exit programs, the carrier said, while another 11,000 have offered to take leaves of absence in October.
“Based on current demand levels, we at American now plan to fly less than 50% of our airline in the fourth quarter, with long-haul international particularly reduced to only 25% of 2019 levels,”  Chief Executive Officer Doug Parker wrote in a letter to employees on Tuesday.  The cuts are deeper for crews involved in international service due to disproportionate declines in international flying.

The company's shares fell as much as 7.4% in early trading on Tuesday after it said sales growth, driven by record online demand for computers and other electronic accessories since March, would ease from current levels of around 20%. 
Retailers like Best Buy have benefited from the trillions of dollars in unemployment checks and other aid pumped into households during the crisis, but consumer spending is expected to slow as job losses become permanent and recession sets in. 
In the second quarter, Best Buy's comparable sales rose 5.8%, beating the average expectation of a 3.7% increase, according to IBES data from Refinitiv, but far short of big-box retailer  Target  Corp's (N:TGT) 24% increase. 
The company also said it was seeing shortages of some high-demand products, especially in the gaming category, where sales have been surging, thanks to kids shut at home by school closures and other restrictions. 
Best Buy Chief Executive Officer Corie Barry said the availability of Sony Corp's (T:6758) upcoming PlayStation 5 and  Microsoft Corp 's (O:MSFT) Xbox Series X, would be clearer only closer to their launches during the holiday season.
""Production and manufacturing facilities are running at holiday levels, and we're working with our vendor partners to get ourselves back into a healthier inventory position,"" Barry said. 
Overall revenue rose nearly 4% to $9.91 billion as U.S. online sales more than tripled. 

Excluding one-time items, the company earned $1.71 per share, beating the average estimate of $1.08 per share.

Hormel also said it had to find alternate ways to increase production, including relying on co-manufacturing partners.
The surge in demand came just as coronavirus outbreaks forced the closure of some of the biggest U.S. meatpacking plants, threatening to cause massive shortages in the nation's meat supply.
""The magnitude of additional recovery in the foodservice industry, the performance of the entire food supply chain and the state of the broader economy remain highly uncertain,"" Chief Executive Officer Jim Snee said. [nPn1BmCJBa]
The company has had to reduce the number of employees working at a time in its plants with staggered shifts and expanded temperature screenings to prevent transmission of the virus.
The company estimates supply chain costs to be around $80 million to $100 million in fiscal 2020.
However, the Skippy peanut butter maker on Tuesday posted a better-than-expected profit for the third quarter, citing a pick-up in its business at restaurants.
Still, Snee added that though the foodservice business has seen a rebound, it was still below last year and expects the trend to continue into the fourth quarter.

Purchases of new single-family houses climbed 13.9% from June to a 901,000 annualized pace from an upwardly revised 791,000, government data showed Tuesday. The median forecast in a Bloomberg survey of economists called for a 790,000 rate of sales. The median selling price rose 7.2% from a year earlier to $330,600.
Sales of new houses have taken off during the pandemic because borrowing costs have never been lower and listings for previously owned homes are in short supply. Shoppers want quarantine comforts, such as backyards and room for offices. And builders are shifting to lower-priced offerings, expanding the pool of potential buyers.
“It has been a rocket ship up since May,” said Rick Palacios, director of research at John Burns Real Estate Consulting, which advises builders. “Demand is insatiable right now.”
The market is so strong that builders are having to raise prices to slow down the pace of sales and ensure they won’t blow through inventory, Palacios said. About 70% of builders surveyed by John Burns Real Estate last month said they increased prices, compared with just 27% in the previous July.
Three out of four major U.S. regions showed higher sales of new homes in July. Purchases surged 58.8% in the Midwest, climbed 13% in the South and 7.8% in the West. Sales fell 23.1% in the Northeast.
The supply of new homes at the current sales pace was four months.
An S&P index of homebuilder shares, which had rallied 30% this year, fell 0.8% at 10:17 a.m. in New York, maintaining earlier declines.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened mixed on Tuesday as the good mood music created by U.S.-China trade talks and falling numbers of coronavirus cases in the U.S. was drowned out by the sound of an approaching hurricane and some ugly-looking consumer sentiment numbers
Hurricane Laura, upgraded overnight from Tropical Storm designation by the National Hurricane Center, is set to make landfall by Wednesday evening, and is set to disrupt the operations of major oil refineries in east Texas and Louisiana, some of which have already been shut as a precaution. So far, however, it appears unlikely that the storm will hit Houston, further west on the Gulf of Mexico coast.
Stocks came under pressure as the Conference Board reported an alarmingly sharp drop in its consumer confidence index for August. The index, which had been expected to rise to 93.0, instead fell to 84.8 - below even the lows registered in March and April. July's number was also revised down.
The blow was, however, cushioned by another blowout set of numbers from the housing sector, where new home sales rose to their highest since 2007 at 901,000. Economists had predicted only 758,000 ahead of time.

Among individual stocks, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock fell 1.9% after a California district court ruled that it couldn't cut off Epic Games's developer accounts, although it did allow the company to keep Epic's blockbuster game Fortnite off its App Store while the two fight over the level of Apple's commissions for in-app purchases. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), which had warned that blocking the Epic's Unreal Engine from the App Store could threaten other developers in a filing for the case, saw its stock rise 0.5%.

LONDON (Reuters) - Brexit safeguards to stop asset managers in Britain running ""shell"" investment funds in the European Union to retain access to its markets should be hardwired into EU law, the bloc's securities watchdog said on Wednesday.
After Britain voted in 2016 to leave the EU, the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) issued guidance on minimum ""substance"" or senior boots on the ground at EU funds typically domiciled in Dublin and Luxembourg and whose portfolio management has been ""delegated"" to London.
""Moreover, in light of the withdrawal of the UK from the EU, delegation of portfolio management functions to non-EU entities is likely going to further increase,"" ESMA said in a letter to the bloc's financial services chief Valdis Dombrovskis.
ESMA said there was merit in providing ""clearer legal drafting"" in the bloc's laws on substance and delegation requirements in line with its earlier Brexit guidance.
The EU may want to back up the ""qualitative"" criteria on substance with clear quantitative criteria, or provide a list of core or critical functions that may not be delegated at alternative and mutual funds, ESMA said.
""Put simply, this is an attack on London,"" said Jake Green, a financial regulatory partner at Ashurst law firm.
""It is also doubtful that Luxembourg and Ireland will be happy with this as it could materially impact their fund offerings,"" Green said.
A pending review of EU alternative fund rules that cover hedge funds and private equity funds was an opportunity to consider ""greater harmonisation"" with regulations governing mutual funds known as UCITS, ESMA said.
Alternative funds must report exposures to real estate and corporate debt to enable authorities to assess if they have enough liquidity in a market crisis.
ESMA said it was ""sub optimal"" that it does not have access to similar data on UCITS without extensive ad hoc data requests that slow down analysis.
ESMA is already checking on liquidity at UCITS.
""This assessment should be based on the analysis of how funds have reacted since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and their current situation, and on an estimation of their resilience to a future shock,"" ESMA said.

854,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 25, 2020 09:11AM ET</span>",Tesla's Musk hints of battery capacity jump ahead of industry event,"SEOUL (Reuters) - Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk has suggested the U.S. electric carmaker may be able to mass produce batteries with 50% more energy density in three to four years, which could even enable electric airplanes.
His comments came as speculation is growing about announcements at Tesla's anticipated ""Battery Day"" event where it is expected to reveal how it has improved its battery performance. 
""400 Wh/kg *with* high cycle life, produced in volume (not just a lab) is not far. Probably 3 to 4 years,"" Musk tweeted on Monday in response to a Twitter thread by Sam Korus, an analyst at ARK Investment Management LLC, about why Musk keeps hinting at a Tesla electric plane.
Researchers have said the energy density of Panasonic's (T:6752) ""2170"" batteries used in Tesla's Model 3 is around 260 Wh/kg, meaning a 50% jump from the current energy density which is key to achieving a longer driving range.
Musk said last year that for electric flight to work, the energy density of batteries needed to improve to over 400 Wh/kg, a threshold which may be achieved in five years.
The electric car manufacturer also showed an image where a number of dots are clustered in line formations, sparking speculation among media and fans about what it will reveal at the event. (https://www.tesla.com/2020shareholdermeeting)
South Korean battery expert Park Chul-wan said the image may hint at ""silicon nanowire anode,"" a breakthrough technology which can potentially increase both battery energy density and battery life sharply.
Panasonic Corp (T:6752) earlier told Reuters that it plans to boost the energy density of the original ""2170"" battery cells it supplies to Tesla by 20% in five years.
Tesla is also working with China's Contemporary Amperex Technology Ltd (CATL) (SZ:300750) to introduce a new low-cost, long-life battery in its Model 3 sedan in China later this year or early next year, with the batteries designed to last for a million miles of use, Reuters reported in May. 
Tesla has said its Battery Day will take place on the same day as its 2020 annual meeting of shareholders on Sept. 22. 

A very ""limited number of stockholders"" will be able to attend both of the events due to pandemic-related restrictions, Tesla said, and a lottery will be held to select attendees.

855,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 25, 2020 09:00AM ET</span>",JPMorgan would need to pay $1 billion for full ownership of China mutual fund JV,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - JPMorgan (N:JPM) would need to pay $1 billion for full ownership of its Chinese mutual fund venture, a statement on the Shanghai United Asset and Equity Exchange showed on Tuesday, a price tag that analysts said was expensive.
JPMorgan's asset management business is to buy the 49% stake it does not already own in China International Fund Management Co (CIFM), a move which follows Beijing's decision earlier this year to fully open up the mutual fund industry to foreign companies.
The CIFM stake is priced at 7 billion yuan ($1.01 billion), according to the statement on the Shanghai United Assets and Equity Exchange, where Chinese state-owned equities are auctioned.
Fund consultancy Z-Ben Advisors said that pegged the deal at 50 times earnings, and represented a 52% premium over fair value.
""Based on numerous metrics, there is no question that this is an expensive deal,"" Z-Ben Advisors said in a note. The higher-than-expected valuation reflects the scarce opportunities for buying a Chinese fund house outright, Z-Ben said.
""Is it worth the premium? For JP Morgan they'd clearly say yes."" 
JPMorgan (N:JPM) declined to comment.
China is opening up its capital markets at a faster pace given trade tensions with the United States. Global asset managers including BlackRock (N:BLK) and Neuberger Berman applied to set up fully-owned China mutual fund units after regulators in April scrapped foreign ownership restrictions in the fund management industry.
JPMorgan, which owns 51% of CIFM, in April reached an agreement with its Chinese partner, Shanghai International Trust Co, for 100% ownership of the fund venture.
Last December, JPMorgan won Chinese regulatory approval to establish a majority-owned securities venture, and in June got a green light for China's first fully foreign-owned futures business.

856,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 25, 2020 08:50AM ET</span>","Alibaba's Ant Group files for blockbuster Hong Kong, Shanghai dual listing","By Julie Zhu
HONG KONG (Reuters) - Ant Group,  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA)'s fintech arm and China's dominant mobile payments firm, filed for a dual listing in Hong Kong and on Shanghai's Nasdaq-style STAR Market on Tuesday and could raise as much as $30 billion in what would be the world's largest IPO. 
Ant's initial public offering would be the first simultaneous listing in Hong Kong and the year-old STAR Market, boosting Hong Kong's status as an international IPO market and helping enhance STAR as a capital markets centre.
Ant, already the world's most valuable unicorn - or billion-dollar unlisted tech firm - did not disclose the size, timetable or other key details of the offering in its preliminary prospectus.
Ant declined to comment on its IPO details.
People with knowledge of the matter have previously said Ant plans to raise more than $20 billion from the dual-listing which could take place in October, valuing the group at over $200 billion. 
The offering size could even reach $30 billion if market conditions allow, said three of the people this week.
That would make it the world's biggest IPO since oil giant  Saudi Aramco  (SE:2222) raised $29.4 billion last December, which surpassed the record set by China's Alibaba Group Holding Ltd's $25 billion float in 2014. 
Ant looks to sell between 10% and 15% of its shares, one of the sources said, requesting anonymity as the details were not yet public. Ant said in its filing that it plans to sell no less than 10% of its enlarged share capital in the dual-listing. 
The company was valued at about $150 billion in its last funding round https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ant-financial-fundraising/ant-financial-raises-14-billion-in-worlds-largest-ever-single-fundraising-idUSKCN1J407Y in 2018, which brought in big-name investors such as Temasek Holdings Ltd (TEM.UL) and Warburg Pincus LLC (WP.UL).
Ant plans to use the proceeds raised to expand its user base and cross-border payments as well as enhancing its research and development capabilities. 
BOOST FOR HONG KONG 
Ant's prospectus gave investors the first look at the firm's financial health ahead of the IPO.
The company said revenue was 72.5 billion yuan ($10.5 billion) in the first half of the year, up nearly 40% compared to the same period in 2019. Profit rose nearly 12 times to 21.9 billion yuan in the same period.
The numbers underscore how Ant, 33%-owned by Alibaba and controlled by Alibaba founder Jack Ma, has remained resilient even as the COVID-19 pandemic has crippled many businesses. 
Ant has amassed a range of financial licenses including payments, online banking, insurance and micro lending to operate in China's vast financial market.
Its biggest and best-known business is Alipay, the largest player in China's 430 trillion yuan ($62 trillion) third-party mobile payments market, according to market researcher Qianzhan.
Alipay had 711 million monthly active users as of June, with payment volumes reaching 118 trillion yuan in China, Ant's filings showed. 
Alibaba set up Alipay in 2004, modelling the business on U.S. peer  PayPal Holdings Inc  (NASDAQ:PYPL), to help Chinese buyers shop online. It spun off the unit which operated the online payments platform in 2011 over the objections of shareholders ahead of its own IPO. 
It re-branded the unit https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-alibaba/alibaba-affiliate-alipay-rebranded-ant-in-new-financial-services-push-idUSKCN0I50KJ20141016 as Ant Financial in October 2014 and in May it was renamed Ant Group. 
Both Hong Kong and mainland China have been working to raise their appeal as places to raise cash. 
The float would be a boost to the city's status as a global capital markets centre as its leaders come under fire for the imposition of a national security law by Beijing criticised in the West as draconian.
Companies raised $10.3 billion via IPOs on the STAR Market in the first seven months of the year, making the bourse the second-biggest market globally for such listings, behind Nasdaq but ahead of Shanghai's main board and Hong Kong, Refinitiv data showed.
CICC,  Citigroup  (NYSE:C), JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) are sponsoring Ant's IPO in Hong Kong, while CICC and China Securities Co are leading the float's onshore leg.

Smucker Co (N:SJM) on Tuesday raised its forecast for fiscal 2021 adjusted profit, after the Jif peanut butter maker topped estimates for first-quarter sales on strong demand for its coffee, frozen sandwiches and fruit spreads. 
Shares of the Uncrustables frozen sandwiches maker rose 3% in premarket trade, with a surge in demand for packaged foods as work-from-home policies and the closure of schools have led to consumers keeping the preference they picked up during the lockdown: eating at home to dining out.
Sales in its U.S. retail consumer foods segment climbed 22%, while U.S. retail coffee business rose 23% in the quarter. 
Orrville, Ohio-based Smucker forecast fiscal 2021 adjusted earnings to be between $8.20 and $8.60 per share, and net sales to be flat or grow up to 1%.
The Folgers coffee maker had previously projected net sales to decline 1%-2% and adjusted profit per share of $7.90 to $8.30 in fiscal 2021. 

Excluding items, Smucker earned $2.37 per share, compared with Wall Street expectations of $1.67 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Net sales rose to $1.97 billion from $1.78 billion in the first quarter ended July 31. Analysts on average had expected the food processor to post net sales of $1.81 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

859,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 25, 2020 07:36AM ET</span>",U.S. Stock Market Bulls From UBS to BofA See More Gains Ahead,"(Bloomberg) -- Valuations aren’t actually that elevated. It’s “melt-up” time. Equity laggards are about to have their moment. These are just some of the reasons why bulls say U.S. shares will defy doomsayers and go higher.
The S&P 500 closed at a record 3,431.28 on Monday, buoyed by hopes for a coronavirus vaccine and expectations of continuing support from economic stimulus. While the likes of  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) have been among those expressing skepticism about the rally, strategists from  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). to RBC Capital Markets and  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C). have raised their year-end targets.
Here are some of the reasons why analysts expect more gains:
Laggards to Leaders
For UBS AG Global Wealth Management’s Chief Investment Officer Mark Haefele, it’s time for under-performing stocks to catch up with the high-flying megacaps.
“Laggards and long-term themes are likely to support the next leg higher,” Haefele wrote in a note Monday. “A large share of recent gains have come from the top six U.S. technology firms. For investors with high exposure to these stocks, we recommend rebalancing into cyclical and value stocks, which have so far lagged.”
True Value
Standard measures of valuation may not be painting an accurate picture of whether stocks are expensive or cheap, according to Leuthold Group Chief Investment Strategist Jim Paulsen.
He points to the output-gap-adjusted price-earnings ratio, which shows the S&P 500 was cheaper only at the bear-market lows of 1974 and 1982. While the gauge is “hardly scientific,” he says it has produced a superior return profile since World War II.
“With the U.S. real output gap currently at a record low, the earnings outlook for U.S. companies is probably far stronger than most currently appreciate,” Paulsen wrote. “And, if this is true, the U.S. stock market may actually be trading at a far more reasonable valuation level than traditional measures suggest.”
‘Melt-Up’
Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC). technical strategists Stephen Suttmeier and Jordan Young see gains ahead, though they caution that narrowing market breadth can be an issue and is worth watching into September.
The S&P 500 would have to breach the 3,285-3,272 level “to suggest the onset of increased volatility that often ushers in the bearish August-October period,” they said, adding that “until then, the tactical pattern favors more upside.”
If there’s a “melt-up,” they don’t rule out a move up to 3,700.

860,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 25, 2020 07:15AM ET</span>",KFC tells customers to hold off on the 'Finger Lickin' for now,"(Reuters) - Kentucky Fried Chicken is temporarily suspending its long-time advertisement slogan ""it's finger lickin' good"", calling it inappropriate in the current COVID-19 pandemic situation where personal hygiene has become top priority to stem transmission.
In an era when face masks and hand-washing have become the norm and health officials are recommending people to stop touching their faces, KFC said the slogan ""doesn't feel quite right.""
The slogan, used on and off by the Yum Brands Inc (N:YUM) owned chain for 64 years, will be paused in advertising around the globe from Monday and re-appear when the time is right, the company said in a press release.
The restaurant chain unveiled a short video clip on its KFC UK and Ireland YouTube channel on Monday, showing various KFC chicken buckets with the ""Finger Lickin'"" words blurred out from its captions.
The ad then ends with the tagline ""That thing we always say? Ignore it. For now"".
The move comes after the chain pulled down one of its advertisements in the UK featuring the catchphrase, which showed people licking their own fingers as well as those of their companions after eating its chicken.
The ad, broadcast in March, was widely criticized on social media as promoting behavior that could increase the chance of COVID-19 and the UK's Advertising Standards Authority received at least 150 complaints, according to the Drum.
It is also another example of a major company being forced to rethink names of brands and taglines, following social media backlash for being insensitive or out of touch with the times.
Consumer goods giant  Unilever  (L:ULVR) recently changed the name of its 40-year old ""Fair & Lovely"" skin cream brand, while soda maker PepsiCo (O:PEP) plans to change the name of its Aunt Jemima cake mixes after coming under social media pressure.

""We find ourselves in a unique situation - having an iconic slogan that doesn't quite fit in the current environment,"" KFC's global chief marketing officer, Catherine Tan-Gillespie, said in a statement.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Exchange operator Nasdaq Inc (O:NDAQ) has filed with U.S. regulators to change its rules to enable companies that debut on the stock market through a direct listing to raise capital, as an alternative to an initial public offering.
The move underscores a desire for an alternative route to the public markets to an IPO, for decades the avenue used by the likes of Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) and Apple Inc (O:AAPL), amid criticism by venture capital firms that investment banks underprice IPOs to help investors score big gains. 
Nasdaq made the proposed rule change in a filing submitted on Monday and which is set to be published by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Tuesday. 
Nasdaq has been working on the filing for around a year, according to a person familiar with the matter. 
The SEC already allows direct listings for companies that do not raise capital in the process. In 2018, music streaming business  Spotify Technology  SA (N:SPOT) was the first major company to go public through a direct listing.
The rival New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in June submitted an amended rule change with the SEC that would also enable companies to raise capital through a direct listing.
Nasdaq's proposal would see a company, with the help of an investment bank, set a non-binding price range in advance of the first trade on the exchange, with a fixed number of shares being sold. There is no limit on how much above the price range a company's share price could open; the stock would not open more than 20% below the range. 
Under the NYSE's June proposal, a stock would need to open within the proposed price range. 
There were 109 U.S. IPOs so far this year, as of Aug. 21, excluding special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) listings, according to IPOScoop. They have delivered an average first-day pop of 35.7%, according to Reuters calculations of IPOScoop data. 

Venture capital investors including Benchmark's Bill Gurley have criticized the IPO structure, arguing it allows banks to sell stock at a discount to their clients, who can then reap large gains when the stock begins trading.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are set to open higher Tuesday, continuing the recent record run, as China and the U.S. reaffirmed their commitment to their trade deal.
At 7:10 AM ET (1110 GMT), S&P 500 Futures traded 14 points, or 0.4%, higher, the Dow Futures contract rose 185 points, or 0.7%, while Nasdaq 100 Futures gained 7 points, or 0.1%. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.4% to hit a new 6-month high at the close Monday, while the S&P 500 added 1% and the Nasdaq Composite index climbed 0.6%, both reaching new all-time highs.
Helping the tone Tuesday were reports that top U.S. and Chinese officials had held constructive talks aimed at resolving concerns around the Phase 1 trade deal reached between the two countries in January.
China's commerce ministry said in a statement there had been ""constructive dialogue"", while the U.S. Treasury declared that ""both sides see progress"". 
Tensions have been fraught between the globe’s two economic superpowers over a variety of factors, including the spread of the Covid-19 virus, the new security laws in Hong Kong and China’s ambitions in the South China Sea.
Such issues had raised fears that the trade deal could founder as a result, particularly as hard data show that China has bought only a fraction of what it promised to buy from the U.S. in the deal it signed in January.
Adding to the positive tone was the news that the number of new U.S. coronavirus cases fell 17% last week, the fifth straight week of declines, according to Reuters data. 
In corporate news, Apple’s four-for-one stock split has resulted in changes in the makeup of the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM), Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN) and Honeywell International (NYSE:HON) are set to join the prestigious index as of Aug. 31, with  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM),  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and Raytheon Technologies (NYSE:RTX) leaving.
Exxon Mobil is the oldest continual member of the Dow, having joined in 1928 as Standard Oil. Following Exxon's exit,  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) will be the index's last remaining energy company.
The retail sector has more earnings scheduled Tuesday, with  Best Buy  (NYSE:BBY) and Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN) expected to report strong numbers, while the economic data slate includes new home sales for July as well as August consumer confidence figures.
Oil prices edged higher Tuesday, amid large production cuts in the U.S. Gulf Coast due to Tropical Storms Marco and Laura, with the latter now forecast to become a major hurricane before landfall on the south coast of the U.S.
Investors now await the American Petroleum Institute's analysis of crude oil supply, due later in the day.

The London-listed firm, already among the leading players in the global race to develop a successful vaccine, said the study would evaluate if AZD7442, a combination of two monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), was safe and tolerable in up to 48 healthy participants between the ages of 18 and 55 years.
If the UK-based early-stage trial, which has dosed its participants, shows AZD7442 is safe, AstraZeneca said it would proceed to test it as both a preventative treatment for COVID-19 and a medicine for patients who have it, in larger, mid-to-late-stage studies.
AstraZeneca shares were up about 1% at 87 pounds ($114) in early trading.
Development of mAbs to target the virus, an approach already being tested by Regeneron (O:REGN), ELi Lilly (N:LLY), Roche (S:ROG) and Molecular Partners (S:MOLN), has been endorsed by leading scientists.
mAbs mimic natural antibodies generated in the body to fight off infection and can be synthesised in the laboratory to treat diseases in patients. Current uses include treatment of some types of cancers.
U.S. infectious diseases expert Anthony Fauci has called them ""almost a sure bet"" against COVID-19, and AstraZeneca in June received $23.7 million in funding from U.S. government agencies to advance development of antibody-based treatments for COVID-19. 
""This combination of antibodies, coupled to our proprietary half-life extension technology, has the potential to improve both the effectiveness and durability of use in addition to reducing the likelihood of viral resistance,"" said Astra's executive vice president of biopharmaceuticals R&D Mene Pangalos.
Though vaccines are at the heart of the long-term fight against the pandemic, alternative treatments are also being advanced, and the United States on Sunday authorized use of recovered COVID-19 patients' plasma to treat those who are ill.

The Financial Times reported at the weekend that President Donald Trump's administration was considering a fast-tracked approval of AstraZeneca's COVID-19 vaccine before November's elections.

Southeast Asia’s second-biggest budget carrier by market value reported a net loss of 992.9 million ringgit ($238 million) in the three months ended June 30 versus net income of 17.3 million ringgit a year ago, according to an exchange filing Tuesday. Sales plunged 96% to just 119 million ringgit.
Chief Executive Officer Tony Fernandes has been in talks for joint ventures and collaborations that may result in additional investment for the beleaguered airline. Bank loans and other capital-raising proposals are also being weighed.
Airlines globally have grounded thousands of planes as countries shut borders and restricted people’s movements. According to the International Air Transport Association, the industry likely won’t recover to pre-pandemic levels until 2024.
Some signs of a recovery are at least emerging for regional aviation, with Singapore and Malaysia agreeing to form travel bubbles to allow people to move between the two countries. AirAsia, which is based in Malaysia, resumed flights in the domestic market in late April after suspending them for a month.
AirAsia’s auditor Ernst & Young said last month that the carrier’s ability to continue as a going concern may be in “significant doubt” because its current liabilities exceeded its current assets at the end of 2019 even before the pandemic. It also sounded a warning on AirAsia X Bhd., AirAsia’s long-haul arm.
South Korea’s SK Group said in June that it was in talks to buy a small stake in AirAsia, without providing further details. AirAsia has also cut the salaries of management and deferred plane deliveries in an attempt to shave costs by 30% this year.
The budget carrier is one of Airbus SE’s major customers for A320s while AirAsia X is the world’s biggest customer of Airbus A330neo planes. AirAsia X has 78 of the aircraft on order, according to Airbus’s website, and has already deferred delivery of some A330neos.

(Reuters) - Renewed optimism over a U.S.-China trade deal and a smaller-than-expected decline in German economic output fuelled gains in European stocks on Tuesday, with Frankfurt shares hitting a one-month high.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index (STOXX) rose 0.4%, extending Monday's gains, which were driven by positive updates on COVID-19 treatment efforts. 
Shares of AstraZeneca (L:AZN) rose 0.8% after the British drugmaker said it had started testing an antibody-based cocktail for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19.
Global markets got a boost as top U.S. and Chinese trade officials reaffirmed their commitment to the Phase 1 trade deal despite diplomatic rifts between the two countries.
The trade-sensitive German DAX (GDAXI) rose 0.6% after data showed Europe's largest economy contracted by a record 9.7% in the second quarter, but marked a minor upward revision from an earlier estimate of -10.1%.
A separate set of data from the Ifo Institute showed German business morale improved more than expected in August, boosting hopes that companies were recovering from the coronavirus shock.
""German manufacturing is doing pretty well and part of it is the exposure to China, and it seems pretty clear that China went into this crisis early, and also came out of it,"" said Nick Nelson, head of European equity strategy at Swiss bank UBS.

LONDON (Reuters) - Trial data for the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca (NYSE:AZN)'s possible coronavirus vaccine could be given to regulators this year but corners cannot be cut to speed up approval for emergency use, a scientist leading the trials said on Tuesday. 
The Oxford vaccine produced an immune response in its first human trials, underlining its position as one of the leading candidates in the race to combat a virus that has led to hundreds of thousands of deaths and crippled the global economy.
""It is just possible that if the cases accrue rapidly in the clinical trials, that we could have that data before regulators this year,"" Andrew Pollard, director of the Oxford Vaccine Group, told BBC Radio of progress in larger, late-stage trials. 
""Then there would be a process that they go through in order to make a full assessment of the data.""
The trials hit the headlines earlier this week when the Financial Times reported the Trump administration was considering fast-tracking the vaccine for use in the United States ahead of the Nov. 3 presidential election. 
One option being explored would involve the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) awarding ""emergency use authorization"" in October to the potential vaccine, the newspaper said. 
Pollard said the process for emergency use authorisation was well established. ""But it still involves having carefully conducted data ... and evidence that it actually works,"" he said.
The Financial Times reported that Washington was considering basing emergency approval of the vaccine on just a small UK study of around 10,000 people.
Pollard, the chief investigator of the global clinical trials of the vaccine candidate, said AstraZeneca would take the data to regulators once the scientists were satisfied with it.
He said Oxford had enrolled about 20,000 people in trials across Britain, Brazil and South Africa, with AstraZeneca leading a U.S. trial of 30,000 people.

""The size of the trials still isn't the issue here, what you need is to have enough cases accruing during the time of observation in the trials,"" Pollard said.

LONDON (Reuters) - European shares opened higher on Tuesday, with market sentiment propped up by the United States and China saying they are still committed to their Phase One trade deal, and some increased optimism around COVID-19 vaccine development.
After the STOXX 600 saw its biggest daily gain in almost two weeks on Monday, the bullish mood continued throughout the New York and Asian sessions.
Top U.S. and Chinese officials had a phone call in which they reaffirmed their commitment to the Phase One trade deal agreed in January, in a positive sign after months of disputes over the COVID-19 pandemic, China's national security law and Chinese technology firms.
The news lifted Asian currencies and stocks, with the Chinese yuan firming slightly overnight.
Market sentiment was also buoyed by a Financial Times report that the U.S. government was considering fast-tracking an experimental vaccine, developed by the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca (NYSE:AZN), to make it ready before the November elections.
A spokeswoman for AstraZeneca denied the company had discussed an emergency use authorization for its potential vaccine with the U.S. government.
The director of the Oxford Vaccine Group said on Tuesday that the vaccine in development could be put before regulators this year.
European share indexes opened higher, with the STOXX 600 up 0.4% and London's FTSE 100 up 0.3% at 0803 GMT.
The MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 49 countries, was up 0.2%. MSCI's main European Index was up 0.7%.
VACCINE TREATMENT
""It has been suggested that yesterday’s rally was as a result of optimism over a new vaccine treatment being fast tracked by October, however the reality is that anyone with an ounce of common sense will know that this outcome is highly unlikely to happen,"" wrote Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK.
""Yesterday's rebound was probably driven by nothing more than a lack of bad news, fear of missing out, and expectations of continued central bank monetary stimulus,"" he said.
Hewson added that the rebound in U.S. stocks could be called ""unbalanced"" as it is being driven by a relatively small group of big technology companies.
The dollar index fell gradually overnight, down 0.2% at 93.061 by 0803 GMT, while the euro was up 0.4% at $1.18325.
Euro zone bond yields rose for the second day in a row, with the benchmark ten-year German Bund yield at -0.468%.
Germany's final second quarter GDP was revised slightly upwards to a 9.7% contraction in April, May and June, up from 10.1%.
This record decline is much stronger than in the financial crisis more than a decade ago, and is the sharpest fall since Germany began to record quarterly GDP calculations in 1970.

Market participants are looking ahead to the U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's address at the Jackson Hole symposium - his first public appearance since the central bank's policy meeting in late July.

DUBAI (Reuters) - Etihad Airways is asking cabin crew to take up to six months unpaid leave from September as it tries to manage the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, according to an internal memo and two sources familiar with the matter.
The Abu Dhabi state carrier, which lost $758 million in the first half of the year, has been gradually resuming passenger services since June after grounding flights in March. 
In an internal memo, staff were told that the airline has more cabin crew than are required and that many are not being rostered on flights, which is not sustainable for the business.
Cabin crew can take between 10 days to six months of unpaid leave from Sept. 16, the email said. 
Etihad did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment.
The airline, which had been restructuring before the pandemic and had lost $5.62 billion in the four years to 2020, has cut thousands of jobs this year, sources have told Reuters.

Aviation has been one of the worst-hit industries during the pandemic and airlines around the world expect it to take years before travel returns to pre-pandemic levels.

Nicolai Tangen and Norges Bank, which manages the wealth fund, agreed to new contractual terms for the incoming CEO during a meeting on Monday. The revised agreement followed demands made last week by Norway’s parliament targeting potential conflicts of interest tied to Tangen’s controlling stake in AKO Capital LLP.
Read: Hedge Fund Boss Under Pressure to Divest for $1.2 Trillion Job
Norway’s political establishment has already hinted that the new CEO contract probably satisfies their demands. Finance Minister Jan Tore Sanner gave the new agreement his blessing, and said lawmakers probably would too. Several opposition parties have since said they welcomed the new terms.
The Progress Party, an ally of the minority government, called the changes “a very good answer,” even wishing Tangen good luck as CEO. The opposition Labor Party -- the country’s biggest political group -- said parliament’s signals “appear to have been taken seriously.”
According to the new terms, Tangen will:
“I’m doing this to remove any doubt about which hat I’m wearing now,” Tangen said. “I’m still strongly and deeply motivated to go into public service, and use the knowledge I have of international finance to manage the Norwegian people’s common fortune.”
Norges Bank said the new arrangements made Tangen free to start in his new job from Sept. 1, as planned. The bank also said it will take a bit longer to implement the new contractual terms, meaning they won’t all have been enacted by the time he starts.
Boiling Point
Last week, pressure on Tangen and Norges Bank Governor Oystein Olsen, who was in charge of the recruitment, reached boiling point after parliament backed criticism from Norges Bank’s watchdog. The supervisor pointed to unresolved conflicts of interest stemming from Tangen’s remaining AKO stake, as well as his firm’s use of tax havens, even after he had reduced his stake and put his holdings in a blind trust.
The head of Norges Bank’s Supervisory Council, the watchdog, didn’t immediately reply to a call seeking comment on Tuesday.
In an interview, Tangen said he’d already agreed to the new terms on Sunday. He also said the intensity of the opposition to his candidacy at no point made him want to give up.
“When you’re an asset manager, you need to be used to the fact that people don’t agree with your investments,” he said by phone. “If they do, it’s usually not a very good investment. You need to be used to, and capable of, being unpopular.”
Another important attribute of good asset managers is being able to “change your mind when things change,” he said.
The 54-year-old has repeatedly said he wouldn’t have applied for the CEO job at the wealth fund if he’d known he would need to exit AKO entirely. Since his appointment was made public in March, Tangen said he’s been through “the most intense, the most demanding, but also the most instructive” time of his life. He said the process had left him even more motivated to start the job.
Despite all the drama, Tangen said he didn’t “for one second” consider withdrawing from the process. “But I think it’s fair to say that Oystein [Olsen] owes me a beer,” he said.

The deal will lift Itochu’s stake in FamilyMart to 65.7% from 50%, allowing the trading company to begin the process of delisting the convenience store operator from the first section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange and take it private, the company said in a statement Tuesday.
The transaction, announced in early July, had faced criticism from activist investors. Itochu had offered 2,300 yen for the FamilyMart shares it did not already own, but some investors said the convenience store operator’s full value wasn’t reflected in the offer price, which represented a premium of 31% at the time. Funds such as RMB Capital and Oasis Management demanded that Itochu either raise its offer or that FamilyMart pay out a special dividend to shareholders.
FamilyMart directors had said they supported Itochu’s tender offer, and that shareholders should make their own decision. Shares of the convenience store franchiser had traded above 2,300 yen after the Itochu offer was announced, until about two weeks ago.
FamilyMart shares rose 1.7% to 2,295 yen on Tuesday.
Both companies have said they thought combining resources would help FamilyMart move more quickly to meet challenges as it pursues digitalization, a payments business and overseas expansion. The convenience store market in Japan is saturated and dominated by three majors — 7-Eleven, FamilyMart and Lawson — making business fiercely competitive. FamilyMart is the country’s second-largest convenience store franchiser, with more than 15,000 locations.
The coronavirus pandemic has also hit the convenience store industry as fewer people venture out and about in high-density areas where most stores are located. Convenience store sales in Japan fell for the fifth straight month in July, according to the Japan Franchise Association.
Japan’s trading companies have been increasing their stakes in the country’s biggest convenience store operators as a way to diversify business away from the volatile commodities business. In 2016, Mitsubishi Corp. paid 144 billion yen to purchase a controlling stake in Lawson Inc.

Investing.com - European stock markets pushed higher Tuesday, helped by German growth data not being as bad as feared as well as by positive comments after trade talks between the U.S. and China. 
At 3:40 AM ET (0740 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.7% higher, having earlier hit a new month high, the CAC 40 in France rose 0.6% and the U.K.'s FTSE index was up 0.9%.
Germany's economic output fell by a record 9.7% in the second quarter of 2020 at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, the latest economic figures showed Tuesday, an improvement on the original release showing a drop of 10.1%. 
“Details of the 2Q GDP report show the severity of the crisis in all its dimensions,” said analyst Cartsen Brzeski at ING, in a research note. “But the good thing is that now the worst is finally behind us.”
The more recent improvement should be reflected in the Ifo institute's business climate index for August, due to be released at 4 AM ET (0800 GMT).
Also helping the tone were reports that top U.S. and Chinese officials had held constructive talks aimed at resolving concerns around the Phase 1 trade deal reached between the two countries in January.
China's commerce ministry said in a statement there had been ""constructive dialogue"", while the U.S. Treasury declared that ""both sides see progress"". Hard data show that China has bought only a fraction of what it promised to buy from the U.S. in the deal it signed in January, largely because the pandemic crushed demand for imports such as oil and liquefied natural gas.
""This is consistent with market expectations of the Phase 1 deal staying healthy and likely to hold, even as U.S.-China tensions flare up along non-trade dimensions - technology, access to capital, geopolitics,"" Reuters reported  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) analysts as saying in a research note.
In corporate news, Aveva (LON:AVV) stock rose 1.6% after the information technology company said it was buying OSIsoft for $5 billion in a mostly cash deal to expand its position in industrial software.
SAS (ST:SAS) soared 7.7% after the Stockholm-based airline said it signed a 3.3 billion Swedish kronor ($375.3 million) revolving credit facility after posting a net loss in the third quarter of fiscal 2020 due to the coronavirus pandemic.
Oil prices were mixed Tuesday, with disruptions to production operations in the Gulf of Mexico and at refineries on the coast still distorting price movements. Tropical Storm Marco was downgraded to a depression by the National Hurricane Center overnight, but Laura was upgraded to a hurricane, expected to make landfall on Thursday.
The American Petroleum Institute’s estimate of crude oil supplies last week are due later in the day.
U.S. crude futures traded 0.2% lower at $42.53 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract rose 0.1% to $45.69. 
Elsewhere, gold futures rose 0.1% to $1,940.20/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.3% higher at 1.1820.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - A federal judge on Monday blocked Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) from shutting down an Epic Games tool that is relied upon by hundreds of other app makers but had become the subject of an antitrust battle between the companies.
The ruling safeguards ""Fortnite"" creator Epic's computer graphics software Unreal Engine, which it offers through an affiliate business and which hundreds of games and other apps use to power their apps on Apple's iPhones. 
""Epic Games and Apple are at liberty to litigate against each other, but their dispute should not create havoc to bystanders,"" Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers (NYSE:ROG) wrote in a ruling late on Monday.
The legal battle arose after Apple this month removed Epic's ""Fortnite"" game from Apple's App Store and an affiliated account, effectively blocking distribution of Unreal Engine, when Epic rolled out its own method of in-game purchases in ""Fortnite"" rather than using the required Apple system that charges commission of between 15% and 30%. 
Epic then alleged in a lawsuit and social media campaign that Apple has engaged in anticompetitive behavior by abusing its dominance in the market for iPhone apps, marking the highest-profile challenge to app store business.
Epic had sought to reverse its punishments by Apple until the broader case could be decided. 
Gonzalez Rogers said ""the current predicament (with ""Fortnite"") appears of its own making"" and refused to order its reinstatement. But she allowed Unreal Engine to continue powering iPhone apps, saying that Apple's actions against Epic's affiliates had been too severe because they had not breached the iPhone maker's policies as ""Fortnite"" had.
During a terse exchange with Apple counsel Richard Doren at a hearing on Monday, the judge said she saw ""no competition"" to Apple's App Store on the iPhone.
""The question is, without competition, where does the 30% (App Store commission) come from? Why isn't it 10? 20? How is the consumer benefiting?"" she asked.
Doren replied that consumers had choices when deciding to buy an Android device or an iPhone. 
""The competition is in the foremarket,"" he said, reiterating an argument that has been central to Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook's defense during Congressional antitrust hearings.
Gonzalez Rogers replied that there was ""plenty of economic theory"" to show that switching brands imposed costs on consumers.

She at one point muted Doren in the virtual proceedings. Doren later said that Apple would prove at trial that ""people switch all the time"".

The deal has no major impact on Finnair's operating result for the third quarter of 2020, it said.
Finnair plunged to a second-quarter loss and said it would make a similar loss this quarter, despite operating more flights.
Finnair raised 501 million euros last month from an oversubscribed rights issue and has also received state and bank guarantees for a 600 million euro loan.

Investing.com - European stock markets are set to open higher Tuesday, helped by German growth data not being as bad as feared and by yet another record closes on Wall Street, as well as by positive comments after trade talks between the U.S. and China. 
At 2:10 AM ET (0600 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.7% higher, the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. rose 0.3%, while CAC 40 futures in France climbed 0.6%.
Germany's economic output fell by 9.7% in the second quarter of 2020, the latest economic figures showed Tuesday, an improvement on the original release showing a drop of 10.1%.
Also helping the tone were reports that top U.S. and Chinese officials had held constructive talks aimed at resolving concerns around the Phase 1 trade deal reached between the two countries in January.
China's commerce ministry said in a statement there had been ""constructive dialogue"", while the U.S. Treasury declared that ""both sides see progress"". Hard data show that China has bought only a fraction of what it promised to buy from the U.S. in the deal it signed in January, largely because the pandemic crushed demand for imports such as oil and liquefied natural gas.
""This is consistent with market expectations of the Phase 1 deal staying healthy and likely to hold, even as U.S.-China tensions flare up along non-trade dimensions - technology, access to capital, geopolitics,"" Reuters reported  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) analysts as saying in a research note.
On Monday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.4%. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite rose 1% and 0.6%, respectively, to close at all-time highs.
These indexes were helped by signs the U.S. is stepping up efforts in its fight against the coronavirus pandemic, with the aggressive authorization of experimental treatments to fight the virus.
The news surrounding the coronavirus has been relatively positive in the U.S., with the number of new cases falling 17% last week, the fifth straight week of declines, according to Reuters data. 
However, the number of cases globally has soared past 23 million, amid new outbreaks in Europe and Asia, including the first documented instance of human re-infection in Hong Kong. 
Turning back to Europe,  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) announced Tuesday plans to merge the business of its subsidiary Neue Aargauer Bank with that of Credit Suisse, establishing a single brand in Canton Aargau, Switzerland.
The Swiss bank aims to  generate cost savings of around 100 million Swiss francs ($109.7 million) a year from 2022 onward.
Oil prices were mixed Tuesday, as large production cuts in the U.S. Gulf Coast due to Tropical Storms Marco and Laura competed with rising coronavirus cases in Asia and Europe for attention.
Investors now await the American Petroleum Institute’s prediction of crude oil supply, due later in the day.
U.S. crude futures traded 0.1% lower at $42.57 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract rose 0.2% to $45.73.

The move, announced on Tuesday, is the latest stage in the revamp of the lender's Swiss retail business. The overhaul forms part of an group-wide 400 million franc savings package unveiled at the end of July.
""The changes to Credit Suisse's branch network across Switzerland, including branches in Canton Aargau, are expected to be implemented by the end of 2020,"" Switzerland's second-biggest bank said in a statement. 
""With a goal of 109 locations – compared to 146 at present – Credit Suisse will continue to have a strong regional presence in the future."" 
Savings would be achieved both through headcount reductions as well as lower general expenses related to branch closures and the merging of subsidiary Neue Aargauer Bank with Credit Suisse (Schweiz), it said.
It will introduce a new digital offering in October as it shifts focus onto digital banking and a more complex branch service for others with stronger advisory needs.
Anticipated restructuring costs of around 75 million francs were expected to be booked within a year, as the programme is completed, it said, and fall under the group-wide 300 million - 400 million franc restructuring costs announced in July.
Further details on its new digital plan will be presented in September.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Qantas Airways Ltd (AX:QAN) announced plans to cut up to 2,500 more jobs by outsourcing its Australian ground handling operations to lower costs as it braces for a A$10 billion ($7.17 billion) revenue hit due to the pandemic this financial year.
The job cuts flagged on Tuesday are on top of 6,000 across its workforce announced in June, which would take the total job losses to nearly 30% of its pre-pandemic staffing.
Qantas' head of domestic operations Andrew David said outsourcing ground handling jobs at the country's biggest airports would save an estimated A$100 million each year in operating costs. 
""It would match our ground handling services with fluctuating levels of demand,"" David told reporters at a briefing. ""We know an external party can turn our aircraft at 40% lower cost than we can using our resources.""
It would also allow the airline to avoid investing A$100 million in equipment like tugs and bag loaders over the next five years by outsourcing the work to a specialist ground handler, Gareth Evans, Chief Executive of Jetstar, Qantas' budget arm, said. 
The executives did not name the firms that could be involved in the outsourcing, but major ground handlers in Australia include dnata, Swissport and Menzies Aviation. 
Qantas shares were up 1.7% on Tuesday afternoon, compared with a 0.2% rise in the broader market (AXJO).
As part of a union agreement, Qantas said it would also have to offer the opportunity for the 2,000 ground handlers at its main brand to bid for the work, though it will not have to do so at Jetstar. 
The airline said it would complete its review over the next few months. Most of its ground handling employees have been stood down from work for months and are receiving government aid due to the decline in travel demand.
Transport Workers' Union National Secretary Michael Kaine, whose union represents the ground handlers, said in a statement the announcement of job losses was ""utterly devastating"".

886,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 25, 2020 01:15AM ET</span>",Facebook blocks group critical of Thai monarchy amid government pressure,"By Patpicha Tanakasempipat
BANGKOK (Reuters) - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) blocked access within Thailand to a group with 1 million members that has criticised the country's king, but said it was planning a legal challenge to the government's demand that it block the group.
The move comes amid near daily youth-led protests against the government led by the former military junta chief and unprecedented calls for reforms of the monarchy. 
The ""Royalist Marketplace"" group was created in April by Pavin Chachavalpongpun, a self-exiled academic and critic of the monarchy. 
On Monday night, the group's page brought up a message: ""Access to this group has been restricted within Thailand pursuant to a legal request from the Ministry of Digital Economy and Society.""
Pavin, who lives in Japan, said Facebook had bowed to the military-dominated government's pressure.
""Our group is part of a democratisation process, it is a space for freedom of expression,"" Pavin told Reuters. 
""By doing this, Facebook is cooperating with the authoritarian regime to obstruct democracy and cultivating authoritarianism in Thailand."" 
Pavin's new group of the same name already had over 455,000 members on Tuesday. 
Facebook said on Tuesday it was planning to legally challenge the Thai government after being ""compelled"" to block access to the group. 
""Requests like this are severe, contravene international human rights law, and have a chilling effect on people's ability to express themselves,"" a Facebook spokesperson said. 
""We work to protect and defend the rights of all internet users and are preparing to legally challenge this request."" 
Thailand's lese majeste laws, which forbid defaming the king, with penalties of up to 15 years in prison, is often the basis for such requests to block or remove content on social media platforms. 
Earlier this month, Thailand's digital minister accused Facebook of not complying with requests to restrict content, including insults to the monarchy.
On Aug. 10, he gave Facebook 15 days to comply with court takedown orders or face charges under the local Computer Crime Act, which carries a fine of up to 200,000 baht ($6,367.40) and an additional 5,000 baht ($159.18) per day until each order is observed.
Digital ministry spokesman Putchapong Nodthaisong said on Monday that Facebook cooperated before the deadline because it understood the context of Thai society. 
Putchapong did not comment on Facebook's plan for legal action when asked by Reuters on Tuesday. 

The ministry last week filed a separate cybercrime complaint against Pavin for creating the group.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - An Australian court overseeing a criminal cartel case against  Citigroup  Inc (N:C) and  Deutsche Bank  AG (DE:DBKGn) on Tuesday declined a prosecution request to delay proceedings, raising the chances the long-running matter will proceed to trial this year.
In the country's biggest white collar criminal case, a regulator has accused the investment banks of colluding over a A$2.5 billion ($1.8 billion) 2015 share issue to withhold unsold shares and keep the stock from falling. Their client, Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd (AX:ANZ), is also defending the case.
But the matter, which has nine defendants including the financial giants and their staff and former staff, has been crawling through the lower court in Sydney since the charges were laid in mid-2018 as defence lawyers question prosecution witnesses to determine the parameters of the complex case.
The ruling that the parties must begin a case management hearing on Nov. 24, not Dec. 15 as requested by the prosecution, gives the matter a chance of moving to the Federal Court, where a trial would take place, before the end of the year.
""We've reached the point where I have to say enough's enough,"" Magistrate Jennifer Atkinson told the Downing Centre Local Court in a short administrative hearing.
""It's not fair to people to leave it too much longer. It needs to leave this court,"" she added.
Prosecution lawyer Shanaka Jayasuriya told the court the later date would help all parties involved because ""the reality is that organising nine separate case conferences is a challenge (and) some of the clients are located overseas"".
The matter is being closely watched by financial markets participants around the world because it could influence how capital raisings are conducted.
None of the defendants has entered a formal plea but all have said they will plead not guilty to the charges which potentially carry prison terms.

Investing.com – Asian stocks were mostly up on Tuesday morning, boosted by a record run in the U.S. markets overnight over high hopes for a COVID-19 treatment.
Cambridge, MA-based  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) said via a press release on Monday that it was in “advanced exploratory talks with the European Commission to supply 80 million doses of mRNA-1273, Moderna’s vaccine candidate against COVID-19, as part of the European Commission’s goal to secure early access to safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines for Europe.”
The announcement comes on the back of the U.S.’ Food and Drug Administration (FDA)’s emergency use approval on Sunday for a potential COVID-19 treatment using blood plasma from patients who have recovered from the virus.
“A steady flow of progress with COVID-19 treatments/vaccines is delivering the latest boost to risk appetite,” OANDA senior market analyst Edward Moya said in a note.
But in the same note, Moya warned that “market breadth however does not support the surge to record high territory for U.S. indexes.”
Japan’s Nikkei 225 jumped 1.79% by 11:17 PM ET (4:17 AM GMT).
South Korea’s KOSPI rose 1.41%, ahead of the Bank of Korea setting its monetary policy on Thursday. Although the country reported 280 COVID-19 cases as of midnight Monday, down from the 397 cases reported as of midnight Saturday it ordered the closure of most schools in Seoul and the surrounding areas earlier in the day.
Down Under, the ASX 200 was up 0.50%. The Commonwealth Bank of Australia provided a bleak picture of the country’s economic recovery from COVID-19, warning that the current recession will extend into a third quarter, the longest slump since 1982-83, and unemployment will remain elevated in 2021 due to a tepid recovery.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index edged down 0.17%, reversing earlier gains. Although the city recorded only nine new cases on Monday, researchers from the University of Hong Kong (HKU) also said that a man in his 30s was reinfected with COVID-19, almost five months after his initial infection, and the first case of COVID-19 reinfection globally.
China’s Shanghai Composite inched up 0.07% and the Shenzhen Component was up 0.52%. U.S. officials, including U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, spoke with Chinese Vice Premier Liu He in a “regularly scheduled call,” with a U.S. Trade Representative’s Office statement saying that both sides saw progress made on resolving issues in the phase one trade deal between the two countries.

CHICAGO (Reuters) - Delta Air Lines (N:DAL) is set to furlough 1,941 pilots in October, the carrier said in a memo to employees on Monday that noted the fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic and plunging air travel demand.
U.S. airlines have warned they will need to furlough tens of thousands of workers once $25 billion in U.S. government stimulus funds run out in September. The aid, which covered employees' pay, was meant to help them weather the pandemic and preserve jobs until a recovery, but travel remains depressed. 
""We are six months into this pandemic and only 25% of our revenues have been recovered. Unfortunately, we see few catalysts over the next six months to meaningful change this trajectory,"" Delta's head of flight operations John Laughter said in the memo.
He said the airline is ""simply overstaffed.""
Atlanta-based Delta had originally estimated a surplus of 2,558 pilots but reduced the number of involuntary furloughs following early retirement and voluntary departure programs, a spokeswoman said.
But there were still roughly 11,200 active pilots on Delta's roster, Laughter said, with only about 9,450 needed for the summer 2021 schedule, which the carrier expects will be the peak flying period for the next 12-18 months.
The Air Line Pilots Association, which represents Delta's pilots, said it was ""extremely disappointed"" in the decision.
Pilots are the only unionized work group at Delta, which last month said furloughs could be avoided if pilots agreed to a 15% cut to minimum pay.
U.S. airline unions, however, have been reluctant to negotiate pay cuts, having only recently recouped wages lost after the 2001 Sept. 11 attacks and a string of bankruptcies and mergers that followed.
Peers such as American Airlines (O:AAL) have said they are trying to keep as many pilots as possible on board due to the costly and timely training required to bring them back in a recovery. 
Airlines and unions have been lobbying Washington to extend another $25 billion in aid to protect jobs through March, but talks are at a standstill.

Delta also announced on Monday the retirement of Chief Operating Officer Gil West, who helped lead the integration of Delta and Northwest after joining the company in 2008.

Virgin Atlantic agreed the deal with shareholders and creditors in July to secure its future beyond the coronavirus crisis. 
The airline, which is 51% owned by Richard Branson's Virgin Group and 49% by U.S. airline Delta, said it remains confident in the restructuring plan and is on track to finalise its solvent recapitalisation in the first week of September.
Tuesday's vote of affected trade creditors includes nearly 200 suppliers that the airline owes more than 50,000 pounds to. It needs 75% support of the overall outstanding value of money owed at a hearing at London's High Court.
If successful, another UK court hearing will be held on Sept 2 to approve the plan, and a procedural hearing is scheduled for Sept 3 in the United States.
Should the creditors fail to support the plan, the judge can still rule that it is in their interests for it to go ahead.
Virgin Atlantic has had to close its base at London's Gatwick Airport and cut more than 3,500 jobs to contend with the fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic, which has grounded planes and hammered demand for air travel.
Global airline body IATA has said that the industry will not return to pre-crisis levels until 2024.
Although the likes of Germany and the United States have given bailouts to major carriers, Virgin Atlantic agreed a private-only restructuring deal after Britain said state support would only be considered after all other avenues had been exhausted.

Rumo SA is poised to sell 235 million new shares at 21.75 reais apiece, the people said, asking not to be named as the information has yet to be made public. If an additional 82.25 million shares are fully sold, the total raised could reach about 6.9 billion reais, according to calculations based on the prospectus.
Rumo didn’t immediately respond the request for comment.
Controlled by energy and infrastructure conglomerate  Cosan  (NYSE:CZZ) SA, Rumo owns railways that connect Brazil’s agricultural heartland with the nation’s largest ports. In May, it signed an extension of a concession for the Malha Paulista network until 2058, with an estimated 6.1 billion-real investment. Proceeds from the offering will go to renewal fees and associated projects.
Banks running the deal were Bradesco BBI, BTG Pactual, Itau BBA, BB Investimentos, JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), Safra,  Citigroup  (NYSE:C),  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS),  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) and XP (NASDAQ:XP) Investimentos.
In 2019, Rumo won a concession to operate a 955 mile-stretch of the Norte-Sul railway, which will be the spine of a planned network connecting farming states like Mato Grosso with ports. It will spend about 2.7 billion reais to complete the line.
Cosan is considering listing other subsidiaries, including Raizen, as part of a corporate reorganization. Gas and energy unit Compass has filed a request for an initial public offering.

892,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 24, 2020 08:55PM ET</span>",Key Hyundai affiliate aims to muscle into electric vehicle market as longtime suppliers turn to outsiders,"By Hyunjoo Jin and Joyce Lee
SEOUL (Reuters) - As Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) accelerates the shift to electric cars, Hyundai Motor <005803.KS>'s loyal suppliers have increasingly turned to ""outsiders"" for parts - but now the South Korean carmaker's own supply company, Mobis, is plunging into the game.
 Hyundai Mobis  (KS:012330) is in talks with two global automakers to supply electrified parts, its executive told Reuters, as it hopes to boost volume and lower prices.
The move is a direct response to companies such as Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) and Tesla muscling in with suppliers with whom Hyundai had worked for decades.
""We were not able to supply to other companies because we were busy with keeping up with Hyundai's growth. Now this has changed,"" said Ahn Byung-ki, senior vice president of electric powertrain business at Hyundai Mobis. 
""If we increase outside sales, overall prices will drop. This will benefit everyone - us, global companies and Hyundai,"" said Ahn, who previously developed eco-friendly cars at Hyundai Motor.
Hyundai Mobis, in which Hyundai Motor Group chairman Chung Mong-koo is the biggest individual shareholder, gets more than 90% of its revenue from the mothership. 
Ahn said reducing electric vehicle (EV) costs is key to competing with cheaper gasoline cars without subsidies, especially as Chinese rivals undercut Hyundai, and Tesla accelerates the industry's shift to EVs.
He said Mobis hoped to win orders from a couple of global automakers as early as this year, marking its first deal to supply electrified powertrains, although it has supplied other parts of EVs or gasoline cars to Fiat-Chrysler and others.
Hyundai suppliers can leverage Hyundai's longtime experience with developing eco-friendly cars, he said, which puts them ahead of European peers who have focused on diesel.
Hyundai Motor and its affiliate Kia Motors ranked third in global battery electric vehicle sales last year, behind Tesla and Renault-Nissan, according to researcher LMC Automotive. 
Hyundai Motor Group's heir and de facto leader, Euisun Chung, recently said Hyundai is aiming to have more than 10% of EV global market share in 2025.
Logistics affiliate  Hyundai Glovis  Co Ltd (KS:086280), which counts Euisun Chung as its biggest shareholder, has also expanded customers from Hyundai to Tesla and Volkswagen to transport vehicles across continents. 
(GRAPHIC: Hyundai suppliers seek to diversify on change - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/xklpynkejvg/index.html)
SEEKING SURVIVAL
Like many of Korea's family-owned conglomerates, or chaebol, Hyundai Group is deeply invested in vertical integration, with affiliates making key parts and even steel. Family members, aides and others close to the company founded key suppliers.
After years of breakneck growth, however, Hyundai-Kia's production volume began trending down in 2016, hitting suppliers and moving them to rely less on Hyundai. 
""As growth slowed, Hyundai told suppliers to survive on their own,"" said Lee Hang-koo, senior researcher at Korea Institute for Industrial Economics & Trade. 
Hyundai supplier Hanon Systems (KS:018880), which supplies parts to Tesla Model 3 and Volkswagen's ID3, generates more than half of its revenue from non-Hyundai customers.
Myoung Shin Co Ltd, founded by a former confidant of Hyundai's legendary founder Chung Ju-yung planned to manufacture EVs for Chinese startup Byton after acquiring GM's (N:GM) closed factory in Korea, creating potential competition with Hyundai, a key customer. An affiliate is also supplying hot-stamping parts to Tesla for the Model 3's body. 
But the pandemic hit Byton hard, delaying Myoung Shin's plan to start pilot production of Byton's M-Byte model this year, a person familiar with the matter said, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter.

(Reuters) - Shares of Salesforce.com (N:CRM), Amgen (O:AMGN) and Honeywell International (N:HON) each surged over 3% in extended trade on Monday after it was announced they would join the Dow Jones Industrial Average as of Aug. 31.
 Exxon Mobil  (N:XOM),  Pfizer  (N:PFE) and Raytheon Technologies (N:RTX), which S&P Dow Jones Indices said would leave the 30-component Dow as part of the changes, each fell more than 1%.
S&P Dow Jones Indices, which manages the Dow, said the shakeup was a result of Apple's (O:AAPL) four-for-one stock split, which will take effect the same day. 
The drop in Apple's stock price resulting from its split will reduce its weight within the Dow, along with the overall weight of the technology sector in the Dow. 
The index is weighted based on the share prices of its components, not on each company's overall market value. Adding cloud computing heavyweight Salesforce.com reduces the decline of tech's weighting in the Dow. 
""The announced changes help offset that reduction. They also help diversify the index by removing overlap between companies of similar scope and adding new types of businesses that better reflect the American economy,"" S&P Dow Jones Indices said in a press release.
Exxon Mobil is the oldest continual member of the Dow, having joined in 1928 as Standard Oil Co (New Jersey). Following Exxon's exit,  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) will be the Dow's last remaining energy company.
Trading at prices of $217, $245 and $165, respectively, following the announcement, Salesforce, Amgen and Honeywell will have greater weight within the Dow than the companies they are replacing. Exxon last traded at $41.55, Pfizer at $38.22 and Raytheon (NYSE:RTN) was last at $60.06.

Following the changes, Unitedhealth Group (N:UNH) will become the most heavily weighted stock in the Dow, followed by  Home Depot  (N:HD) and then Amgen. Apple, currently the most heavily weighted stock, will recede to 17th place.

The stipulation, in a letter from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to Vancouver-based Northern Dynasty Minerals (NYSE:NAK) Ltd, could delay final permit approval for the mine. The company described the request as routine.
Shares of Northern Dynasty lost nearly 40% of their value on Monday following the announcement by the Army Corps, which said the mine would cause ""unavoidable adverse impacts to aquatic resources.""
The administration of Republican President Donald Trump had moved closer last month to approving the mine's permit, reversing a decision by former Democratic President Barack Obama.
But a prominent group of Republicans, including Trump's son Donald Trump Jr. and Fox News host Tucker Carlson, have publicly voiced opposition, saying the mine would destroy areas where they enjoy fishing and hunting.
Alaska's two U.S. senators, Dan Sullivan and Lisa Murkowski, the powerful chair of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, came out against the mine on Monday evening. The two Republican senators said in separate statements that the mine, as currently proposed, would cause too much environmental damage. 
""With the Pebble Mine, there's no way you could clean up the damage. The fish would be gone forever,"" said Andrew Sabin, a metals magnate and conservationist who said he has privately lobbied Trump against the mine in recent weeks.
Salmon fishers in Alaska's Bristol Bay pulled in $309.6 million last year, an all-time high, with more than 44 million salmon caught across the region, according to state data. 
Monday's move guarantees any final decision will come after the U.S. presidential election on Nov. 3, when Trump will face former Vice President Joe Biden, who is opposed to the mine.
The Pebble Mine would produce 70 million tons of gold, molybdenum and copper ore a year and create a pit 1,970 feet (600 meters) deep in Alaska's Bristol Bay watershed.
The Army Corps is effectively giving Northern Dynasty about three months to specify how it would preserve acreage equal to the area that would be harmed by the mine's construction.
For its part, Northern Dynasty said it plans to ""preserve enough land so that multiples of the number of impacted wetland acres are preserved."" The company said the White House had ""nothing to do with the letter"" from the Army Corps.
The White House on Monday referred all requests for comment to the Army Corps, which reiterated the stipulations in the letter it sent to Northern Dynasty.
Environmentalists and other groups were quick to pounce on the move, saying the entire project should be canceled.
""It is impossible for Pebble to mitigate the devastation this mine will have on our Native cultures,"" said Alannah Hurley of the United Tribes of Bristol Bay, which represents 15 area American Indian tribal governments. 
Northern Dynasty on Monday launched an advertising campaign targeting Trump and his administration officials to coincide with the first day of the Republican National Convention.

Rejecting the Pebble Mine after extensive review by federal, state and local regulators would politicize the permitting process and slow the U.S. economic recovery, Northern Dynasty said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Monday dismissed a lawsuit accusing Denmark's  Danske Bank  A/S (CO:DANSKE) and four former top executives of defrauding shareholders by hiding and failing to stop widespread money laundering at its former Estonian branch.
U.S. District Judge Valerie Caproni in Manhattan said shareholders in the proposed class action failed to sufficiently plead that the bank improperly reported revenue derived from money laundering or downplayed its supervision failures.
She also said the plaintiffs, led by four pension funds in New York and Massachusetts, failed to show that Danske acted recklessly or with conscious disregard that its statements were false and misleading.
""They allege in a conclusory way that defendants and employees of (Danske) received reports contradicting public statements, and fail to connect any of those reports to specific representations by specific persons,"" Caproni wrote.
The plaintiffs had sought damages for investors who lost money in Danske's American depositary shares from Jan. 9, 2014 to April 29, 2019.
They sued four months after Danske said in September 2018 that an internal probe had uncovered about 200 billion euros ($236 billion) of payments made from 2007 to 2015 through its Estonian branch, with many payments appearing suspicious.
Lawyers for the plaintiffs did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Danske's lawyers did not immediately respond to similar requests.
Claims against former Chief Executive Thomas Borgen, former Chairman Ole Andersen and two former chief financial officers were also dismissed.
Authorities in several countries began investigating the suspicious payments made through the Estonian branch, and Estonia ordered Danske to exit the country. The bank has also faced investor litigation in Denmark.

The case is Plumbers & Steamfitters Local 773 Pension Fund vs Danske Bank A/S et al, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 19-00235.

896,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 24, 2020 06:09PM ET</span>","They Beat Covid, But Debilitating Effects and Economic Costs May Linger for Years","(Bloomberg) -- Before Daniela Alves caught Covid-19 in March, the 31-year-old Londoner regularly worked overtime to accelerate her career as a mobile app designer. Now, she struggles with client meetings, and says persistent fatigue has halved her productivity.
“I was a beast before, but now things are different,” Alves says over Zoom, pausing frequently to catch her breath or cough. “I can’t physically do it, and I’m approaching life differently.”
Alves said she needed three months off work even after experiencing a “mild” infection that didn’t require hospitalization. Covid-19’s lingering effects count her among an expanding population of so-called long-haulers -- survivors left with debilitating conditions who represent another insidious dimension of the pandemic.
It’s now known that SARS-CoV-2 will leave a portion of the more than 23 million people it’s infected with a litany of physical, cognitive and psychological impairments, like scarred lungs, post-viral fatigue and chronic heart damage. What’s still emerging is the extent to which the enduring disability will weigh on health systems and the labor force. That burden may continue the pandemic’s economic legacy for generations, adding to its unprecedented global cost -- predicted by Australian National University scholars to reach as much $35.3 trillion through 2025 as countries try to stop the virus’s spread.
More Stories:
“The bottom line is that the physical, long-term health consequences are very serious for people’s welfare, and in economic terms,” said Hannes Schwandt, an assistant professor of education and social policy who studies well-being and economic outcomes at Northwestern (NYSE:NWE) University in Evanston, Illinois. “But, we don’t know enough about it yet.”
While it’s unclear how many survivors become long-haulers, a Covid-19 symptom study in the U.K. with more than 4 million participants found 1 in 10 people are sick for a least three weeks. People with mild cases of the disease are more likely to have a variety of “strange” symptoms that come and go over a longer period, according to Tim Spector, professor of genetic epidemiology at King’s College London, who is leading the study.
‘Weirder It Gets’
“The more we learn about coronavirus, the weirder it gets,” he said.
The still-evolving clinical picture, dearth of patient follow-up, and incomplete data on the number of people afflicted by Covid-19 make it difficult to predict the pandemic’s long-term health and economic consequences, according to Christopher J. Murray, director of the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington in Seattle.
“There’s enough out there to suggest it’s appreciable, and this is something we’re becoming interested in trying to measure,” said Murray, who has studied the global burden of disease for almost 30 years.
That information will be critical for anticipating and funding future health-care needs, said Thomas File, president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America.
‘Significant Burden’
“If you look at the intermediate-term consequences right now, we’re already seeing it” on the lungs, heart, neurological and psychological systems, said File, who is also chair of infectious diseases at Summa Health, a hospital system in Akron, Ohio. “This is going to have a significant burden on our health-care system for years to come.”
The economic impact will be much greater if younger survivors endure decades of coronavirus-related disability, said Olga Jonas, a former economic adviser at the World Bank who studies the impact of contagions at Harvard University in Boston. Polio, a paralyzing disease, would have led to an estimated $215 billion in treatment costs in the U.S. from 1955 to 2015 had vaccines not become widely available, a 2006 study found.
There has been little recognition so far of Covid-19’s ill-effects on younger adults, said Hannah Wei, a 30-year-old long-hauler in Canada, who helps other sufferers through survivor support group Body Politic. An analysis of responses from 640 patients collected by the group in April and May found “recovery is volatile, includes relapses, and can take six or more weeks.”
Although all respondents experienced symptoms consistent with Covid-19, 48% were either denied testing or not tested for another reason. That can makes obtaining financial assistance for rehabilitation and disability services more difficult, Wei said.
‘Especially Neglected’
“In the beginning of the pandemic, a lot of my age cohort weren’t the ones being tested, so we’ve been especially neglected from the system and not recorded on official numbers,” said Wei, who caught Covid-19 in March. “Now we’re seeing a lot of these people become long-haulers.”
Even if such cases are identified, there’s still no guarantee the economic consequences will be adequately quantified, said Janet Currie, an economics professor at Princeton University. For example, employment surveys favored by economists don’t routinely ask if people have disabilities, she said.
Also, the long-term economic effects of Covid-19 will ripple well beyond those who caught the coronavirus, Currie said. Mental health problems emanating from lockdowns will sap work performance and productivity, health-care disruptions may exacerbate other medical conditions, and people needing to provide care for others will have less time for paid work.
In Limbo
There are also those like Kyle Merryman, who is in limbo over his own classification.
The 39-year-old U.S. Iraq-war veteran developed Covid-like symptoms in January. By the end of April he’d visited the emergency room eight times with symptoms including shortness of breath and blurry vision. Due to the timing of his illness, Merryman wasn’t tested for Covid-19, and an antibody test in June came back negative. Still, he has no other explanation for how he went from being completely healthy to unable to work.
He was recently diagnosed with postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome -- a problem with the automatic nervous system. The condition, which may develop after a viral illness, often causes heart palpitations, chest pain and brain fog, according to the Cleveland Clinic.
“I’m really not sure what my future holds,” said Merryman, who had to take leave from a technology job in Florida and move in with his mother in Texas. “My illness has already put a big financial strain on my family and me.”

897,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 24, 2020 05:50PM ET</span>","TikTok sues Trump administration over U.S. ban, calls it an election ploy","By Echo Wang and Jonathan Stempel
(Reuters) - TikTok and one of its employees on Monday separately sued U.S. President Donald Trump's administration over his executive order banning transactions in the United States with the popular short-form video-sharing app, calling it a pretext to fuel anti-China rhetoric as he seeks re-election.
Culver City, California-based TikTok and its Chinese parent ByteDance Ltd rejected what they called the White House's position that it was a national security threat, saying they had taken ""extraordinary measures to protect the privacy and security of TikTok's U.S. user data.""
They also described Trump's call in his Aug. 6 executive order for a TikTok ban as a means to further his alleged ""broader campaign of anti-China rhetoric"" ahead of the Nov. 3 U.S. presidential election, where Trump is seeking a second term.
""We do not take suing the government lightly,"" TikTok said in a blog post. ""But with the Executive Order threatening to bring a ban on our U.S. operations ... we simply have no choice.""
Patrick Ryan, a technical program manager at TikTok, sued the Trump administration over concerns that he and his 1,500 colleagues, including many on employment visas, will lose their jobs next month if Trump’s order is enforced. 
""These are not decisions that belong to the government,"" Ryan said in an interview. ""It's not okay to even consider.""
Alex Urbelis, a lawyer representing Ryan in the lawsuit in San Francisco federal court, said the order suffered from ""unconstitutional vagueness"" and deprived TikTok employees of due process.
The White House referred a request for comment to the U.S. Department of Justice, which declined to comment on the company's lawsuit and did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Ryan's case.
TikTok and ByteDance are seeking a permanent injunction to block Trump from enforcing his Aug. 6 order. They allege the Trump administration violated their constitutional right to due process by banning the company without opportunity to respond to accusations.
They also allege Trump lacked proper legal authority to issue the order, saying he misused the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, which lets the president regulate international commerce during a national emergency.
Trump had in May 2019 invoked that law to stop alleged efforts by foreign telecommunications companies to conduct economic and industrial espionage against the United States.
The lawsuit filed in Los Angeles federal court names Trump, the U.S. Department of Commerce and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross as defendants.
Amid growing distrust between Washington and Beijing, Trump had for weeks complained that TikTok was a national security threat that might share information about users with the Chinese government.
His Aug. 6 executive order called for banning transactions with the app after 45 days.
Trump issued a separate executive order on Aug. 14 giving ByteDance 90 days to divest TikTok's U.S. operations and any data TikTok had gathered in the United States.
Reuters reported last week that TikTok had been preparing a legal challenge. 
ByteDance had acquired Shanghai-based video app Musical.ly in a $1 billion transaction in 2017, and relaunched it as TikTok the following year.
TikTok, best known for short videos of people dancing that are popular among teenagers, had 92 million monthly users in U.S. as of June and 689 monthly users globally as of July, according to the lawsuit.
The Trump administration has said Americans should be cautious in using TikTok. Under a law introduced in 2017 under President Xi Jinping, Chinese companies have an obligation to support and cooperate in China's national intelligence work.
But TikTok said Trump's Aug. 6 was not rooted in genuine national security concerns or supported by the emergency he had declared a year earlier.
It called the order ""a gross misappropriation of IEEPA authority and a pretext for furthering the President's broader campaign of anti-China rhetoric in the run-up to the U.S. election."" 
ByteDance has been in talks to sell TikTok's North American, Australian and New Zealand operations to companies including  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) and  Oracle Corp  (NYSE:ORCL).
Those assets could be worth $25 billion to $30 billion, people familiar with the matter have said.
Before buying TikTok, ByteDance had not sought advance approval from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which reviews acquisitions for potential national security risks.

CFIUS later opened an investigation and on July 30 issued a letter stating it found national security risks associated with the purchase. But it ""repeatedly refused"" to engage with ByteDance's proposals to address concerns, including a nonbinding letter of intent to sell to Microsoft presented earlier July 30, according to the lawsuit.

900,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 24, 2020 05:20PM ET</span>",U.S. judge overseeing criminal case against Halkbank will not recuse himself,"By Ezgi Erkoyun
ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkish state lender Halkbank has lost a bid to have the U.S. judge overseeing a criminal case accusing it of helping Iran evade American sanctions recuse himself.
U.S. District Judge Richard Berman in Manhattan said in an order on Monday that Halkbank's recusal motion had no substantive merit, rejecting claims by the bank that he was not impartial.
Halkbank co-defendant Reza Zarrab unsuccessfully made a similar bid to recuse Berman four years ago, the order noted.
Zarrab, a wealthy Turkish-Iranian gold trader, was convicted in 2018 for helping Iran evade sanctions. Berman also oversaw that case.
""Haklbank's recusal motion is a belated rerun of the Zarrab recusal motion, supplemented by 1,014 additional pages of exhibits and two purported expert declarations,"" the judge wrote.
U.S. prosecutors have accused Halkbank and bank executives of using money servicers and front companies in Iran, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates to evade sanctions.

They said improper transactions included letting revenue from oil and gas sales be spent on gold, and facilitating sham food and medicine purchases.
Halkbank pleaded not guilty on March 31 to bank fraud, money laundering and four conspiracy charges.
A trial date has been set for March 1, 2021.

901,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 24, 2020 05:18PM ET</span>",China’s Banks Hire Tens of Thousands in Latest Rescue Mission,"(Bloomberg) -- China’s mega banks are ramping up their recruitment of fresh graduates as a record number enter the labor market, joining other state-owned firms in boosting employment even as lenders deal with plunging earnings and ballooning bad debt.
The four biggest state banks, led by Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd., this month kicked off their autumn campus hiring, instead of in November as in previous years. China Construction Bank (OTC:CICHF) Corp. plans to add 16,000 graduates this year, up from 13,000 last year. Bank of China Co. will increase its hiring by 15% to more than 10,000, according to their advertisements. Agricultural Bank of China (OTC:ACGBF) Ltd. already hired 4,500 people during the spring round.
“This is in direct response to the government’s call to protect jobs,” said Tang Jianwei, a Shanghai-based analyst at Bank of Communications Co.’s research institute. “Even though the big banks are facing pressure on their own earnings, they still need people to develop the business. Also it’s important for them to assume social responsibility.”
China’s largest banks have already been leaned on by Beijing to prop up the economy. They’ve been told to pump cash out to small and medium-sized businesses and forgo profits by lowering interest rates and providing relief on trillions of yuan of troubled loans. Most recently, the government doubled down on pressure to get the major state-owned financial groups to cut salaries.
Together, the four biggest banks employ 1.6 million people and Construction Bank’s hiring plans alone approach the combined staff additions made by the largest U.S. and European banks in this year’s first half. Chinese lenders are mostly looking to hire for customer service, wealth management, and information technology, according to job ads on their websites.
Representatives for ICBC, AgBank, Construction Bank and Bank of China declined to comment.
Yet the tens of thousands of new jobs are but a drop in the bucket. The record 8.7 million of fresh graduates face the bleakest job prospects in decades as the global pandemic has pummeled domestic demand and exports. While inching down recently, surveyed urban unemployment hit a record at the height of China’s virus outbreak in February. Unemployment for those of prime graduate age, 20 to 24, hovered at about 20% in July, according to the country’s statistics bureau.
A report by Zhaopin.com, one of China’s biggest recruiting websites, showed that more than a quarter of recent graduates were still looking for a job as of June after hunting for one year, a period during which most would have typically landed jobs in the past.
The government has repeatedly pledged support for jobs and rolled out measures such as increasing recruitment of post-grads, strengthening support for more flexible forms of work for graduates and promoting entrepreneurship among young people. The country’s other state-owned firms have vowed to provide at least a million jobs for the most vulnerable groups, including the newly graduated.
That has done little to help Crystal Wu, who graduated in July from one of the nation’s top universities with a degree in journalism. In her search, she found herself competing against people who already had work experience and at places receiving thousands of resumes rather than the normal few hundred. At the same time, with the travel ban, many students have dropped plans for study overseas, further tightening the jobs market.
“I knew it would be a tough market but this is even worse than I expected,” she said. Wu has opted for doing an internship at a non-profit in Beijing, but has also spent about 20 yuan joining a WeChat group run by a recruitment agency sharing tips on how to get a job at a bank. She prefers a policy lender such Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank or China Development Bank.
Finance is a coveted job. The average annual salary for non-private financial industry employees stood at about 131,000 yuan ($19,000), the third highest among 19 sectors tracked by the statistics bureau and more than 40% higher than the overall level.
Combined earnings at China’s more than 1,000 commercial banks slumped the most in at least a decade in the second quarter as bad loans hit a record 2.7 trillion yuan. The banking regulator said over the weekend that Covid-19 is a centennial catastrophe and that financial industry will need to step up further to get the economy fully back on track.
Globally, the biggest U.S. and European banks added 19,000 people to their payrolls in the first half of the year as demand for loans and other services surged during the pandemic and planned staff cuts were largely put on hold. Eight of the top 15 firms increased headcount this year through June, while only four reduced it with  HSBC Holdings  Plc (LON:HSBA) having the biggest reduction.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq reached new record closing highs on Monday as optimism over potential medical advances in the war against the coronavirus pandemic pushed all three major U.S. stock indexes higher.
The benchmark S&P 500 reclaimed its February closing high last week, confirming a bull market and the fastest recovery from a bear market trough on record.
The blue-chip Dow, while leading Monday's gains, remains nearly 4.2% below its all-time high, and down 0.8% year-to-date. The Nasdaq and the S&P have gained 26.8% and 6.2%, respectively, since the final closing bell of 2019.
Of note, the Dow Transports index, often considered a barometer of U.S. economic health, handily outperformed the broader market.
""There's been a broadening in this rally and the what's reflected in the transports,"" said Chuck Carlson, chief executive officer at Horizon Investment Services in Hammond, Indiana. ""(Higher) volume is accompanying this expanding breadth, and those are all bullish things.""
Markets worldwide were given a boost by new developments in the global race to battle the coronavirus, including an announcement from the Food and Drug Administration that it had given emergency authorization for the use of plasma from recovered patients as a treatment option. 
However, the World Health Organization expressed skepticism about the treatment due to ""low quality"" data.
The Trump administration is considering fast-tracking an experimental COVID-19 vaccine being developed by AstraZeneca (NYSE:AZN) Plc and Oxford University in hopes it could be deployed in the United States before Americans head to the polls in November.
""There's an element of that news helping the 'reopening trade,' which is a euphemism of economically sensitive stocks performing better,"" Carlson added.

On Capitol Hill, Democrats and Republicans remained at loggerheads over funding levels and unemployment benefits.

Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co gave the Dow its biggest lift, rising 6.4%.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 2.52-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.26-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

Investing.com -- Investors cling to the ""accentuate the positive"" mantra despite an ongoing viral pandemic that has caused havoc in global economies.
On Monday, positive news – however incremental – on possible treatments for Covid-19 sent stocks soaring to new records for the S&P 500 and NASDAQ Compositeand lifted the Dow Jones Industrial Average more than 378 points. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) reached above $500 for the first time with just days to go until its four-to-one stock split.
Pharmaceutical makers rose after the Food and Drug Administration granted emergency authorization for therapeutic plasma as a treatment for patients hospitalized with Covid and after the government suggested it may fast-track AstraZeneca PLC ADR (NYSE:AZN)'s coronavirus vaccine.
Even beaten down airline stocks got a boost after the Environmental Protection Agency green-lighted the use of an antiviral spray.  American Airlines Group  (NASDAQ:AAL) jumped 10% after saying it would use the spray in its passenger cabins.
Retailers feature in the tail-end of earnings season, while energy stocks are in the spotlight as two storms head toward the U.S. Gulf Coast.
Here are three things that could affect the markets tomorrow:
1.  Best Buy  one of the retail winners
Electronics retailer Best Buy Co Inc (NYSE:BBY) has been among the winners in the sector as stay-at-home orders created demand for laptops and other gadgets for learning and working. The company is expected to report earnings per share of 99 cents on revenue of $9.6 billion, according to analysts tracked by Investing.com. That would be an increase from 67 cents per share the previous quarter.
The stock is already up 33% this year and hit another record on Monday, trading at $119.48. Raymond James raised its price target to $135, highlighting its strong fulfillment capabilities and ability to gain market share.  
2. Nordstrom an example of the other side of the retail sector
Expectations are already low for department store  Nordstrom Inc  (NYSE:JWN) heading into its earnings report on Tuesday, with analysts estimating a per-share loss of 1.50 on revenue of $2.4 billion.
Sales were better than expected when it reported its previous quarter in May, but the longer-term trend has seen shoppers turning away from traditional stores like Nordstrom and Macy’s Inc (NYSE:M) in favor of  Target  Corporation (NYSE:TGT) and other chains and, of course, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN). Shares of Nordstrom are down 62% this year, though they traded up 7% on Monday.
Last week Target and fellow big-box retailer Walmart Inc (NYSE:WMT) reported big gains in revenue, further cementing the line between the sector's haves and have nots.
Also due out on Tuesday are earnings from Urban Outfitters Inc (NASDAQ:URBN) and Children's Place.
3. Energy sector in focus as storms barrel toward Gulf Coast
A basement-dweller among S&P sectors for years, energy got a brief chance to shine on Monday as the top performer of the 11 in the index, rising 2.5%. The main driver appears to be two storms headed to the Gulf Coast region, where much of the U.S.'s energy businesses operate.
Tropical Storm Marco isn't expected to be as intense as the storm that is expected to become Hurricane Laura by landfall later this week, but it's unusual for two storms to hit within days of each other and basically along the same route. Oil and chemical facilities in the area are shutting down ahead of the storms. Bloomberg reported it could reduce capacity in the oil sector by 1 million barrels a day.
Of course less capacity means oil prices rise, even in the wake of questionable demand. Crude Oil WTI Futures, the U.S. benchmark, rose 0.14% on Monday as of 3:41 PM ET, at around $42.40, while Brent Oil Futures crude, the international standard, rose 1.34%, at $45.53.

906,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 24, 2020 03:50PM ET</span>",New York probing whether Donald Trump and the Trump Organization manipulated asset values,"By Jonathan Stempel
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The New York state attorney general is investigating whether Donald Trump and the Trump Organization improperly manipulated the value of the U.S. president's assets to secure loans and obtain economic and tax benefits, and said Trump's son Eric has been uncooperative in the civil probe.
The disclosure was made in a filing on Monday with a New York state court in Manhattan, where Attorney General Letitia James is demanding that the Trump Organization, Eric Trump and others comply with subpoenas from her office.
Lawyers for the attorney general said the subpoenas were issued as part of her ""ongoing confidential civil investigation into potential fraud or illegality,"" adding there has been no determination that any laws were broken.
Alan Garten, chief legal officer for the Trump Organization, where Eric Trump is an executive vice president, said the company has tried to cooperate with James, a Democrat, as the Republican Trump seeks a second term in office.
""The Trump Organization has done nothing wrong,"" Garten said. ""The NYAG's continued harassment of the company as we approach the election (and filing of this motion on the first day of the Republican National Convention) once again confirms that this investigation is all about politics.""
James said she began her probe after Donald Trump's former personal lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen said in Congressional testimony that the president's financial statements inflated some asset values to save money on loans and insurance, and deflated other asset values to reduce real estate taxes.
She also said Eric Trump was ""intimately involved"" in one or more transactions being reviewed, and had ""no plausible basis"" to refuse to testify pursuant to a subpoena.
Four properties are being probed, with a particular focus on a 212-acre (85.8 hectare) property in northern Westchester County, north of New York City, called the Seven Springs Estate.
James is examining an apparent $21.1 million tax deduction for Seven Springs for 2015 from the donation of a ""conservation easement,"" following Donald Trump's two-decade failure to build a golf course or residential housing on the property.
Other properties being probed include 40 Wall Street in downtown Manhattan, the Trump National Golf Club in Los Angeles, and the Trump International Hotel and Tower in Chicago.
The attorney general said the latter property, which towers a quarter-mile over the Chicago River, has been ""omitted"" from Donald Trump's ""Statement of Financial Condition"" since 2009.
James said ""significant amounts"" of subpoenaed materials have been produced but there is an impasse over other materials.
""For months, the Trump Organization has made baseless claims in an effort to shield evidence from a lawful investigation into its financial dealings,"" James said. ""They have stalled, withheld documents, and instructed witnesses, including Eric Trump, to refuse to answer questions under oath.""
In separate litigation, Donald Trump for a year has been fighting to block Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance from enforcing a subpoena seeking eight years of his tax returns, in connection with a criminal probe.

A federal appeals court will hear Trump's arguments on Sept. 1, after a judge refused to void Vance's subpoena. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled last month that Trump does not deserve immunity from Vance's probe.

907,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 24, 2020 03:36PM ET</span>",Texas Oil Refineries Shutter Ahead of Double Storm Set to Pummel,"(Bloomberg) -- Oil and chemical facilities located along the Texas Gulf Coast are shuttering, securing equipment or running through emergency protocols ahead of a rare double storm set to rip through the region this week.
Some of the largest U.S. refineries are winding down in advance of Tropical Storms Marco and Laura, which could become a major hurricane before landfall, potentially shutting in more than 1 million barrels a day of capacity. Oil operators in the Gulf of Mexico have already shut in more than half of their output. The last time two storms hit the Gulf together was more than six decades ago.
READ: Rare Double Storm Blow Menaces U.S. Gulf With Stronger Laura
Oil and gasoline prices rallied on the disruptions, as fears that the shuttering of the key refineries would mean less availability for oil products. Gasoline futures jumped as much as 7.4% in the day, while the the spread between the prompt and second-month contracts, a closely watched indicator for supply and demand, rallied to as much as 58.8%.
Motiva Enterprises LLC is shutting both its 607,000 barrel-a-day oil refinery and chemical plant in Port Arthur, Texas, according to people familiar with the matter and a regulatory filing.  Valero Energy  Corp (NYSE:VLO). is also shutting its 335,000 barrel-a-day Port Arthur facility, sources said. Oil major Total SE is cutting crude runs by more than 50% at its 225,500 barrel-a-day refinery there. Port Arthur Mayor Thurman Bartie plans to a issue a mandatory evacuation for the city beginning at 6 a.m. local time tomorrow, according to a a Beaumont TV station tweet.
A Motiva official could not immediately be reached for comment. A Valero spokeswoman said the company is monitoring the storms and assessing protocols but did not specifically comment on the shutdown. Total declined to comment on operations.
Meanwhile, at  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM)., officials are readying production units for a possible shutdown at its 369,000 barrel-a-day Beaumont refinery, sources said. An Exxon spokesman said the company is making preparations for any severe weather associated with the storms, though its downstream operations are normal.
At LyondelBasell Industries N.V., which has a refinery in Houston, a spokeswoman said it is “assessing refining operations, securing equipment” and ensuring adequate supplies. Shell (LON:RDSa) said its onshore operations remain normal, though it is one of the many companies that evacuated some personnel from offshore platforms as it shuts in production.

908,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 24, 2020 03:30PM ET</span>","Tesla, automakers urge FTC to seek appeal after defeat in Qualcomm case","By Stephen Nellis
(Reuters) - A group of tech companies and automakers, including Tesla Inc (O:TSLA),  Ford Motor Co  (N:F), Honda Motor Co Ltd (T:7267) and  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn), on Monday urged the U.S. Federal Trade Commission to seek an appeal after its loss in a case against chip supplier  Qualcomm Inc  (O:QCOM).
Earlier this month a U.S. appeals court reversed a lower-court decision against Qualcomm, which makes technology for connecting devices to mobile data networks. The court also vacated an injunction that would have required Qualcomm to change its patent licensing practices.
Qualcomm was fighting a May 2019 decision by U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh in San Jose, California, in a case brought by the FTC. Koh sided with the FTC, writing that Qualcomm’s practice of requiring phone makers to sign a patent license agreement before selling them chips “strangled competition” and harmed consumers.
Automakers have increasingly put chips in vehicles to connect them to the internet, which requires them to sign patent agreements for communications standards such as 5G. The companies had previously argued that connected car prices could go up if Qualcomm won its case.
Qualcomm won its appeal of that ruling before the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in an Aug. 11 ruling by a three-judge panel. In a letter sent Monday, the automakers, as well as Qualcomm rivals  Intel Corp  (O:INTC) and MediaTek Inc (TW:2454), urged the FTC to seek an ""en banc"" rehearing of the case by the full appeals court.
""If allowed to stand, the panel’s decision could destabilize
the standards ecosystem by encouraging the abuse of market power acquired through collaborative standard-setting,"" the group said.

An FTC spokeswoman declined to comment.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Shareholders of Far Point (N:FPAC), the blank-check company backed by U.S. hedge fund Third Point (NYSE:TPRE) LLC, on Monday approved the proposed $2.6 billion acquisition of Swiss payments company Global Blue. 
The vote caps months of wrangling between Third Point and the private equity owners of Global Blue, which Far Point had agreed to acquire in January but has since seen its business suffer due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Holders of roughly 67.7% of Far Point shares voted in favor of the deal. Just over 50% support was required to green light the deal. 
Investors with 48.7 million shares opted to redeem their stock to reclaim the initial $10 per share investment made at the time of the Far Point initial public offering in 2018. 
Global Blue processes payments made by international travelers on luxury good purchases at airports and has been hit by the global decline in air travel.
The deal was thrown into doubt in May when Far Point changed its recommendation to shareholders and asked them to vote against the deal. 
Then in July private equity firm Silver Lake, which owns Global Blue together with Partners Group Holding AG, offered a string of concessions to Far Point, including an offer not to issue a pre-transaction dividend of 154 million euros.
A compromise was announced on Aug. 16, with Silver Lake and Partners Group agreeing to take a smaller cash payout in the deal and instead receiving additional shares in the new Global Blue company. 
Far Point is a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) which raised $550 million through an initial public offering (IPO) in 2018 to merge with an unspecified technology company. 
Upon closing of the deal, Global Blue will become a publicly listed company on the New York Stock Exchange.

Louis Vuitton owner LVMH agreed last year to buy Tiffany in its biggest acquisition yet, betting it could restore the lustre of the U.S. jeweller by investing in spruced-up stores and new collections.
Under the deal terms, Tiffany and LVMH set Aug. 24 as the first deadline to complete, but with the proviso that one of the parties could push back that deadline as far as Nov. 24, according to a Tiffany filing to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission submitted earlier this year.
Tiffany is exercising the option to apply Nov. 24 as the ultimate deadline, according to the source. 
An LVMH spokesman declined to comment. Tiffany was not immediately available to comment.
The deal between LVMH and Tiffany has yet to receive the regulatory approvals it requires, in particular from the European Union.
Since the acquisition was agreed, LVMH deliberated about whether to renegotiate the deal, in part on the grounds of the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic on Tiffany's business, people familiar with the matter told Reuters in June. 

But in the end LVMH decided not to seek a re-negotiation, the people familiar with the matter said.

(Reuters) - Video-conferencing company  Zoom Video Communications  Inc (O:ZM) said on Monday it had restored service to its U.S. users after a partial outage left many unable to log in to work meetings or attend school classes remotely.
The San Jose, California-based company has experienced a surge in usage during the coronavirus pandemic, as millions of people turn to it for work meetings, school, social events including weddings and to otherwise stay connected while isolating themselves. Many schools that turned to remote instruction have used Zoom for classes.
Outage tracking website Downdetector.com showed nearly 17,000 incidents of people reporting issues with Zoom earlier in the day.
""We have resolved the issue causing users to be unable to start and join Zoom Meetings and Webinars. Users are now also able to sign up for paid accounts, upgrade, and manage their service on the Zoom website. We are currently monitoring to ensure that these services are operational,"" Zoom said on its website. (https:// The company did not provide details on the cause of outage. Zoom's stock has risen more than eight-fold since its initial public offering last year and four-fold so far in 2020, but it was down 2.9% after falling as much as 5.4% in earlier Monday. Zoom competes with Cisco Systems Inc's (O:CSCO) Webex,  Microsoft Corp 's (O:MSFT) Teams and Alphabet Inc's (O:GOOGL) Google Meet platform for paying customers, particularly enterprises, while offering a free version to customers.  Zoom had 300 million daily meeting participants in April, the latest figures disclosed. Even as its usage has soared, Zoom has come under fire over privacy and security issues, including incidents of ""Zoom bombing"" in which uninvited users entered and disrupted meetings. It has since rolled out major upgrades, including end-to-end encryption for video calls. Although a California company, Zoom has big research and development centers in China with hundreds of employees, according to a filing it made to the U.S. government. ""For sustained growth to continue, it (Zoom) will have to show investors that it can be relied on to ensure its core customers don't drift towards the likes of Microsoft Teams, Google Meet and Cisco's Webex,"" said Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets commentator at  Hargreaves  Lansdown (LON:HRGV).  ""As Zoom fatigue sets in and the pandemic eases, it's even more important that the company demonstrates its systems are secure, if it's to be seen as a long-term player in this competitive market,"" Streeter added. Users took to Twitter to complain about the outage. 
""Zoom having a world wide outage for the first day of school, so 2020!"" Twitter user Anthony Slaughter wrote.

917,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 24, 2020 12:29PM ET</span>",Exclusive: RingCentral Becoming the Other Pandemic Communications Bet,"By Christiana SciaudoneInvesting.com --  Zoom Video Communications  Inc (NASDAQ:ZM) may be the obvious Covid-19 winner on everyone's lips, but there's another communications bet you may be missing: RingCentral (NYSE:RNG).
The Belmont, California-based company provides cloud-based communications and is considered the leader in unified communications as a service in terms of revenue and subscriber seats. Say what? 
Basically, RingCentral allows businesses to connect office, remote, and mobile employees under one phone system, regardless of their location -- remember that Avaya phone on your desk in that big office you haven't seen since March? RingCentral in October signed a deal to partner with Avaya to provide cloud-based services, versus using on-premises components. Good thing, too, considering most office workers are still working remotely.
""We think the future is humongous for the industry,"" said RingCentral Founder and Chief Executive Officer Vlad Shmunis in an interview over the company’s new video offering this past week. ""We don't want to overheat people's expectations,"" but annual revenue of between $5 billion and $10 billion ""doesn't seem to be that undoable.""
The company has matched or beat profit and revenue estimates for the past seven years. Earlier this month, RingCentral reported a 29% year-over-year increase in revenue, to $278 million, and raised total revenue guidance to between $1.135 and $1.143 billion, representing annual growth of 26% to 27%. That's up from previous guidance for a range of $1.116 to $1.125 billion and annual growth of 24% to 25%. 
Shmunis is inclined to be optimistic about his own product, but it’s not just him: All but one of RingCentral’s 20 analysts rate the shares a buy. Investors have taken note, too, more than doubling the stock price in the past year. 
""There are some really, really wonderful things that are happening at RingCentral,"" said Jeff Kvaal, an analyst at Wolfe Research. ""It's not hard to see how they could grow at least 30% for the next three, four, five, seven years in a row.""
To do that, RingCentral has recently signed exclusive deals with Atos, Avaya and Alcatel, representing some 180 million seats of an estimated total of 400 million in the world. Right now, RingCentral has 2 million ""seats,"" which is akin to the number of software licenses it has sold. 
Not that RingCentral is alone. Now that it has added video, its client, Zoom, has also become a rival. A key difference, though, is that Zoom is consumer-based, while RingCentral is business-to-business. The Campbell, California-based company 8x8 competes more directly but is older and reports less than half the annual revenue that RingCentral does.  
There's nothing worse than a glitchy call, RingCentral has invested a lot to maintain quality, Shmunis said. ""It's an ongoing effort,"" he said. ""It's a very, very real problem.""
The gap in quality between RingCentral and its competitors is widening, Shmunis said. 
""The nice thing about this is that you know that enterprise voice is an established market; it's not going away,"" Kvaal said.  ""You know what you are chasing.

918,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 24, 2020 12:20PM ET</span>",Hedge funds in long haul to tackle lack of Black money managers,"By Maiya Keidan
LONDON (Reuters) - When the death of George Floyd forced companies to reflect on why there were so few Black people in their senior ranks, top banks and private equity firms pledged to do better. 
But one corner of the finance world - the hedge fund industry - made fewer public statements. 
Hedge funds are mostly small firms employing people who first made their names in banking. They say their relatively small size and the talent pool they usually hire from makes rapid progress increasing ethnic diversity challenging.
""Those who land in hedge funds are those who have been successful within the banking system in general, so the onus is really on banks creating the talent that will become hedge fund managers,"" said Alain Nkontchou, co-founder of Enko Capital who worked on JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM)'s proprietary trading desk and at BlueCrest.
Black staff in the industry said there had been little progress in hiring and promoting Black people in 20 years. 
A 2018 report by New Financial found the asset management industry in London had just 12 Black fund managers.   
""I hoped we'd be further on today than we are,"" said Marcus Gibbs, head of operations for Europe at an American hedge fund platform, who began working in the industry in 2001 and said he is regularly the only Black person in the room at industry events.
In the United States, 2019 regulatory data showed 8.9% of hedge fund firms were owned by ethnic minorities, including Hispanic, Black, Asian and Native Americans.
""I'd like to see more Black faces in different areas across the hedge fund and asset management community,” said Ansumana Bai-Marrow, chief compliance officer at Cairn Capital.
""I don't see any Black money managers, people making investment decisions, or Black salespeople.""
INVESTOR CONCERNS
Hedge fund industry consultants said that since Floyd's killing some hedge fund investors  - particularly among U.S. pension funds - are asking about diversity.
""In the past, maybe 5% of our clients would engage us on this, now it's more like a quarter,"" said Chris Redmond, head of manager research at consultancy Willis Towers Watson (NASDAQ:WLTW), which advises investors on hedge funds.
""Investors are asking who is on our list of hedge funds who have had good racial and gender diversity."" 
Albourne Partners, another adviser to hedge fund investors, also said more clients wanted to know about diversity.
Albourne launched a survey on Aug. 17 asking hedge funds for data on employee and ownership composition, including ethnicity, gender and sexuality, which the consultancy can use to provide information for investors. 
""We have seen increased concern and awareness from our clients on this issue over the last few months,"" Albourne CEO John Claisse said.
INDUSTRY EXPERIENCES
Reuters asked 30 London-based hedge funds for data on the number of Black staff they employ.
Some funds said they did not disclose diversity data while 11 funds declined to comment, including Lansdowne Partners, Winton Group and Brevan Howard.
TT International Asset Management said that of 89 TT employees, four were Black and one of the four was involved in managing money. The firm also said it plans to start unconscious bias training.
A spokeswoman for Man Group, Europe's largest hedge fund, said the company does not disclose diversity data but runs a Black employees network and supports #talkaboutblack, a campaign to improve diversity in the City of London.
Black people working at hedge funds told Reuters they have faced an array of negative experiences in the industry.
""I'm going to a lunch, I'm wearing a suit like everyone else and someone comes to me and asks me where the cloakroom is,"" said one employee at a fund who did not allow him to speak publicly.
Another senior Black person at a hedge fund who did not wish to be named remembered being repeatedly asked by a colleague to fix his computer problems.
""The guys of my generation are broadly tired. We've seen all of this stuff ... when you're in a conference with your peers and some guy comes up to you and says how do I get to x and y,"".
Daryl Wright, executive board member and head of product & investment management at Lumyna Investments, a platform for hedge funds and asset managers, said the problem was an unconscious association between Black people and negativity. 
""I think that's really what comes into some of the issues we see in the hiring processes, promotions and the way people get treated day to day in the industry.""
Senior hedge fund industry figures said while change has to be led from the top, it needs to start at the bottom. 
""It's quite difficult to address that underrepresentation when there is no middle layer or senior layer to start with,"" said Jonathan Sorrell, president of Capstone Investment Advisors.
Sorrell helped to launch a programme last week where eight hedge funds, including CQS, Man Group, Brevan Howard and TT International, joined more than 80 firms in the asset management industry in committing to each hire at least one Black intern. It aims to boost the number of Black portfolio managers in the long-term. 
Hedge fund industry group AIMA said it is engaging with Black professionals and with hedge fund leaders who want to take action specifically on Black representation. 
For Gibbs, the hope is that change will unfold much faster than it has done since he started out. 

""Now is the time to act,"" he said.

CHICAGO (Reuters) - The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said on Monday it has granted emergency approval for American Airlines (O:AAL) to use a disinfectant against the coronavirus on certain surfaces that lasts for up to seven days, and is studying whether it could be effective in places like schools.
EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler said at a news briefing that SurfaceWise2, made by Allied BioScience Inc, is the first long-lasting product approved by the agency to help fight the spread of the novel coronavirus.
American Airlines will begin spraying its airplane cabins with the disinfectant in its home base of Texas after the state filed the request for emergency approval. The carrier hopes to eventually use it across its entire fleet, including its American Eagle (NYSE:AEO) regional partners. 
The spray does not eliminate the need for cleaning, officials said.
Southwest Airlines (N:LUV), also based in Texas, has been using a two-step process in its cabins that involves an EPA-approved disinfectant spray followed by a separate antimicrobial spray that coats surfaces for at least 30 days.
Reuters first reported on Sunday emergency approval of SurfaceWise2 for use by American and by Texas-based Total Orthopedics Sports & Spine's two clinics for up to a year.

Airlines have rolled out deeper cleaning and disinfecting of airplanes and airport facilities in an effort to convince people that it is safe to resume flying during the pandemic.

Investing.com -- Airlines are up as we cling to any reason to hope the new normal will die and be replaced by the old normal ASAP.
American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) will start spraying airplane cabins with a disinfectant that has proved to fight Covid-19 for up to seven days, and could ease the public's fears over the spread of the virus while traveling.
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency approved Allied BioScience's disinfectant, SurfaceWise2, for Texas-based customers.   
American Airlines rose 8.2%, United Airlines Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:UAL) was up 8% and Delta Air Lines Inc (NYSE:DAL) rose 7.8%.
SurfaceWise2 may eventually be used in offices, schools, gymnasiums and other high-traffic areas.
“SurfaceWise2 creates an invisible barrier on surfaces, which physically breaks down and kills virus cells,” said Dr. Charles Gerba, a leading infectious disease expert, American Airlines said in a statement. “This helps protect passengers and crew members against the transmission of coronavirus via surfaces, particularly on high-touch areas such as seats, armrests, tray tables and overhead bin doors.”

Investing.com --  Odonate Therapeutics  (NASDAQ:ODT) sank more than 31% after announcing results from its Contessa Phase 3 study of tesetaxel in breast cancer patients. 
The safety profile of tesetaxel is what's pulling shares lower, according to Seeking Alpha.
According to Bloomberg, the shares fell because the tesetaxel combination study in patients with metastatic breast cancer showed a more muted benefit compared with capecitabine.
Shares are down by half since mid-June.
Contessa met the primary endpoint of improved progression‑free survival (PFS) as assessed by the Independent Radiologic Review Committee (IRC). Median PFS was 9.8 months for tesetaxel plus a reduced dose of capecitabine versus 6.9 months for the approved dose of capecitabine alone, an improvement of 2.9 months. The risk of disease progression or death was reduced by 28.4% for tesetaxel plus a reduced dose of capecitabine versus the approved dose of capecitabine alone.
Tesetaxel is an investigational, orally administered chemotherapy agent that belongs to a class of drugs known as taxanes, which are widely used in the treatment of cancer. Tesetaxel currently is the subject of three studies in breast cancer, including Contessa.
Contessa is a multinational, multicenter, randomized, Phase 3 study of tesetaxel in patients with metastatic breast cancer.

The project -- which has known deposits of copper, gold and other metals -- is located in an area that drains into Bristol Bay, home to the world’s most productive wild salmon fishery. The plan has drawn opposition from powerful Republicans including Donald Trump Jr.
Conservationists, local activists and fishing operations have fought the project for years, but blocking it would be a reversal for an administration that has allowed a review of the plan to proceed.
Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Mike Kozak put his rating and price target under review for the stock, citing Pebble uncertainties. He noted that the next step for the company will be a letter the U.S. Army Corps will publish on Monday, outlining its proposal to mitigate the project’s wetlands impacts.
Northern Dynasty shares were down 46% as of 10:06 a.m. in Toronto, the steepest drop since at least 1994 when Bloomberg records begin. The shares more than tripled this year through Friday.
The company said Monday in a statement that it launched an advertising and outreach campaign targeting “the Trump Administration, the Republican Party, its delegates and influencers to coincide with the Republican National Convention kicking off Tuesday.” The campaign includes television ads to influence people in the party and others in “the conservative movement.”

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened the week higher as the number of new infections of Covid-19 across the U.S. fell to its lowest in two months, strengthening hopes that the worst of the pandemic's effects on the economy are past.
According to Johns Hopkins data, there were only 34,567 new cases on Sunday. While that reflects the usual dip reported at weekends due to delays in data compilation, it's less than half the peak rate of new infections seen two months ago.
By 10:15 AM ET (1415 GMT) the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 210 points or 0.8% at 28,140 points. The S&P 500 was also up 0.8%, as was the Nasdaq Composite.
Megacap stocks were again outperforming, with Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) stock rising 3.7% on the back of a report by The Wall Street Journal that implicitly confirmed the strength of its lobbying power. The paper reported that CEO Mark Zuckerberg had lobbied actively for U.S. measures against ByteDance, the Chinese owner of video-streaming app TikTok that is one of its biggest competitors in the social media marketplace.
In addition, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock rose 2.6%, shrugging off news that Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) has lent its support to Epic Games, the owner of Fortnite, which is suing to uphold its rights not to pay 30% commissions to the iPhone maker on in-app purchases made through its App Store.
However, it wasn't all one-way traffic. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock finally gave way to gravity, dropping as much as 6% in the first 15 minutes of trading before stabilizing to trade down 3.1%. Zoom Video  (NASDAQ:ZM) stock meanwhile fell 1.6% after reports of an outage affecting its operations in the Eastern and Central time zones. The outage comes at a bad time for the video-conferencing company, which is an important part of the virtual learning programs being offered by schools where Covid-19 has stopped them resuming in-person classes. 
In biotech  Novavax  Inc (NASDAQ:NVAX) stock fell another 10.4% after the company said it would only have interim data from the stage 2 clinical trial of its experimental Covid-19 drug by December, effectively ruling out any chance of it being fast-tracked before the election on Nov. 3.  Moderna  Inc (NASDAQ:MRNA) stock fell 2.5% despite announcing a preliminary contract to sell millions of doses of its Covid-19 drug to the European Union.
AstraZeneca ADRs (NYSE:AZN), by contrast, rose 2% on the back of a report by the Financial Times that the administration is looking to fast-track authorization of its experimental drug, being developed jointly with Oxford University. President Trump had tweeted in frustration on Sunday at unnamed officials in the Food and Drug Administration whom he accused (without providing evidence) of delaying drug approvals so as to hinder his re-election chances.

The inquiry concerns accounts held between 2003 and 2014 on which Belgian prosecutors received information last year from French authorities, who have also conducted their own investigations into the bank and French customers.

The New Jersey-based company said the drug substance will be made at its commercial gene therapy manufacturing facility in Harmans. 
Catalent would supply the so-called viral vector, which is a genetically modified harmless virus designed to trick the human body into producing certain parts of the coronavirus. These proteins, in turn, prompt the immune system to develop an arsenal for any real COVID-19 infections.
There are no approved vaccines for COVID-19, and AstraZeneca is among the companies leading the race to develop a safe and effective option. 
AstraZeneca has signed multiple manufacturing and supply deals globally, including in the United States, Britain, South Korea and Brazil, resulting in a target to make over 2 billion doses of the experimental vaccine.
Catalent struck a deal with AstraZeneca in June to provide vial-filling and packaging capacity at its manufacturing facility in Anagni, Italy and prepare for supplying hundreds of millions of doses of the vaccine from this month, and potentially through until March 2022.

Japan's largest pharmaceuticals company has been selling 
its over-the-counter (OTC) assets worldwide as it seeks to refocus its business and reduce debt following a $59 billion acquisition of  Shire  Plc (LON:SHP) last year. 
Takeda CEO Christophe Weber said via an online briefing the company had decided to sell the Japanese OTC unit because it would be difficult for Takeda to keep investing in OTC businesses while trying to develop new drugs for more serious diseases. 
""My responsibility is to make sure that we don't destroy value (for OTC businesses) but create value, and to create value we need to grow businesses and it's not good to keep business and not invest sufficiently into that,"" said Weber. 
Takeda Consumer Healthcare Company, known for its Alinamin line of energy drinks, is valued at 242 billion yen ($2.29 billion) and the sale price will be determined after calculating its debt and other factors, Takeda said.
Blackstone was among the final bidders for the OTC unit, Reuters reported in June, along with Bain Capital, CVC Capital Partners and Taisho Pharmaceutical Holdings Co Ltd.
Takeda said proceeds from the sale would boost its net profit by 105 billion yen. The transaction is expected close by March 31, subject to regulatory closing conditions, it said. 
Blackstone said in a statement the acquisition of Takeda's OTC unit would be its second in Japan, following the acquisition of Ayumi Pharmaceutical Corp, a maker of anti-rheumatism drugs, in March 2019 in an deal worth $1 billion.

De Beers has finally decided to cut the price of its diamonds in a bid to spark sales after the coronavirus pandemic paralyzed the industry.
De Beers, the world’s No. 1 producer, told customers that it is cutting prices for larger stones by almost 10% at its sale starting this week, according to people familiar with the situation, who asked not to be identified as the details are private.
A spokesman for De Beers declined to comment.
The  Anglo American  (LON:AAL) Plc unit, along with Russian rival Alrosa PJSC, had previously tried to defend the value of the gems as the pandemic hammered the sector. With jewelry stores closed, cutters and polishers stuck at home and global travel at a standstill, the entire diamond industry ground to a halt.
In the second quarter, De Beers and Alrosa sold a combined $130 million in rough diamonds, down from $2.1 billion a year earlier.
De Beers lowered the price of rough diamonds bigger than 1 carat, a size that would normally yield a polished gem of about 0.3 carat in size, the people said. The company held the price of smaller stones as there is very little demand for them and lowering prices by a similar amount would be unlikely to spur demand, they said.
Before the price cut, De Beers had made major concessions to their normal sales rules -- allowing customers to renege on contracts and view diamonds in alternative locations. Still, smaller rivals were selling at a 25% discount, eating into the company’s market share.

Foxconn (TW:2317) (TW:2354) and Pegatron (TW:4938) are known as contractors for several phone manufacturers including Apple (O:AAPL). It was not immediately clear which companies they would work with in Mexico. 
According to two of the sources, Foxconn has plans to use the factory to make Apple iPhones. However, one of the sources said, there had been no sign of Apple's direct involvement in the plan yet.
Foxconn is likely to make a final decision on a new factory later this year, and work will commence after that, the two people said, adding there was no certainty the company would stick to the plan.
Apple spokesman Josh Rosenstock declined to comment.
Pegatron is also in early discussions with lenders about an additional facility in Mexico mainly to assemble chips and other electronic components, said the people, who declined to be identified as the talks are confidential. Pegatron declined to comment. 
Foxconn has five factories in Mexico mainly making televisions and servers. Its possible expansion would underscore a broader and gradual shift of global supply chains away from China amid a Sino-U.S. trade war and the coronavirus crisis.
The plans come as the idea of ""near-shoring"" gains ground in Washington. The Trump administration is exploring financial incentives to encourage firms to move production facilities from Asia to the United States, Latin America and the Caribbean.
Brandishing a new deal locking in free trade with the world's biggest consumer market, Mexico also has geography, low wages and time zones in its favor. Despite the global recession and concerns about the business climate under President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, government data shows foreign investment largely holding up so far this year. 
""The company indeed has contacted the (Mexican) government,"" a third source said about Foxconn, adding the talks were at an early stage and rising cases of coronavirus in Mexico were a major concern for the possible investment.
Taipei-headquartered Foxconn, formally called  Hon Hai  Precision Industry Co Ltd, said in a statement that while it continued to expand global operations and is an ""active investor"" in Mexico, it had no current plans to increase those investments.
Reuters in July reported Foxconn planned to invest up to $1 billion to expand a factory in India where it assembles Apple iPhones.
Foxconn Chairman Liu Young-way told an investor conference in Taipei on Aug. 12 the world was split into ""G2"" - or two groups - following Sino-U.S. tensions, saying his firm was working on ""providing two sets of supply chain to service the two markets.""
""The world factory no longer exists,"" he said, adding that about 30% of the company's products were now made outside China and the ratio could increase.
Foxconn unit Sharp (OTC:SHCAY) has said it is stepping up television production in Mexico. Sharp last year said it would set up a plant in Vietnam to shift part of its China production. It said it had no further information to give.
China's Luxshare Precision Industry Co (SZ:002475) is also considering building a facility in Mexico this year to offset the tariff war between the world's two largest economies, the two sources said. 
It was not immediately clear which product lines were being considered by Luxshare, which according to media reports is a leading manufacturer of Apple Airpods. Luxshare did not respond to a request for comment.
The Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in Mexico, which represents Taiwan's government in the country, said it had heard Foxconn was interested in building another factory in Ciudad Juarez, in the northern border state of Chihuahua.
""Pegatron, I also understand, wants to move a production line from China to Mexico,"" the office's Director General Armando Cheng told Reuters. He said he did not know details of either company's plans.
""Mexico is one of the ideal countries for companies considering readjusting their chain of suppliers,"" Cheng said.
The scale of investment by Asian electronics contract manufacturers, and the employment they would create in Mexico, are not yet clear.
Promised investment in new manufacturing capacity has not always materialized.
In 2017, U.S. President Donald Trump said Foxconn would build a $10 billion plant employing 13,000 people making LCD panels in the state of Wisconsin. 
Those plans have shifted dramatically. In 2019 the company downgraded the size of the planned factory. In April, Foxconn said it would make ventilators at the plant in partnership with  Medtronic  (NYSE:MDT). 
STRETCHED SUPPLY CHAINS
Coronavirus ground cross-Pacific supply chains to a standstill, stranding automobile, electronics and pharmaceutical components from China, exacerbating firms' concerns about having their productive base an ocean away from American consumers.
Additionally, the newly implemented United States-Mexico-Canada trade deal requires more locally sourced inputs for tariff-free exports to the United States.
Mexico has spoken to a host of foreign companies in an effort to lure business from Asia to capitalize on the trade deal and was preparing to speak to Apple about relocating manufacturing, Economy Minister Graciela Marquez told Reuters in July. 
She said she had not spoken to Foxconn, Pegatron and Luxshare directly. A senior government official said those companies were among others interested in investing in Mexico. 
The government did not respond to a request for further comment prior to publication. 
Despite the potential and solid investment figures, many investors see Lopez Obrador squandering a historic opportunity.
""It could have been a tidal wave,"" said Eduardo Ramos-Gomez, a partner at Duane Morris & Selvam, a law firm working with Taiwanese and Chinese companies looking at Mexico.
Critics cite Mexico's poor handling of the pandemic - it is third in global deaths – along with Lopez Obrador's meddling in private investment decisions such as the cancellation of a $1-billion brewery by U.S. firm Constellation Brands (N:STZ), the scrapping of a major airport project and pressure on energy companies. 
The government has denied such decisions were anti-business.
Regardless, Mexico's appeal is attracting some.
Samuel Campos, an executive managing director of real estate brokerage Newmark Knight Frank, said his company is currently helping two Chinese companies, one in the autos sector and the other in manufacturing, relocate to an industrial cluster in Mexico. 
Campos said electronics, medical and automotive firms in Asia are likely to help drive investments into Mexico in the fourth quarter this year.
For Alan Russell, chief executive and chairman of Tecma Group, a company managing factories in Mexico, manufacturers in China that want to keep market share in North America have few choices. 

""They're going to have shorten their supply chain and be more regional,"" he said. ""It seems the virus has tipped the scale.""

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are set to open with strong gains Monday, after the number of new Covid-19 infections across the U.S. fell to its lowest in two months and the Trump administration took an aggressive stance on fast-tracking treatments for the virus, potentially allowing a quicker economic recovery.
At 7:05 AM ET (1105 GMT), S&P 500 Futures traded 27 points, or 0.8%, higher, the Dow Futures contract rose 269 points, or 1%, while Nasdaq 100 Futures gained 105 points, or 0.9%. These indexes are on course for a fifth straight month of gains.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Sunday said that it had issued ‘emergency use approval’ for the use of blood plasma from recovered patients as a Covid-19 treatment option.
The Financial Times also reported that the White House is considering by-passing normal U.S. regulatory standards to fast-track an experimental coronavirus vaccine from the U.K. for use in America before November’s election.
Over the weekend President Donald Trump expressed frustration at the slow pace of approval for coronavirus treatments, linking the FDA to the “deep state” conspiracy theory.


Figures from Johns Hopkins meanwhile showed the number of new infections on Sunday fell to below 35,000, the lowest since late June.
The tech sector has led the rebound in equities for months as the coronavirus crisis accelerated reliance on the Internet for commerce, and this rally has further to run, according to analysts at investment bank J.P. Morgan.
""In contrast to the dot-com bubble, the current rally has been supported by strong earnings delivery,"" J.P. Morgan's equity strategists said in a note on Monday. ""In addition to resilient earnings growth, tech has healthy balance sheets and strong cash flow generation, again in contrast to the 2000 episode.""
The economic data slate is largely empty Monday, and investors are going to focus on Thursday’s speech by Federal Reserve Chair Jay Powell at the Jackson Hole conference, looking for indications on how the central bank will try to manage the long-term economic recovery.
Oil prices edged higher Monday, as Hurricane Marco and tropical storm Laura wrought havoc in the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico, leading to over 58% of offshore oil production in the region being shut down.
U.S. crude futures traded 0.8% higher at $42.66 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract rose 0.7% to $45.25.

CHICAGO (Reuters) - Delta Air Lines (N:DAL) has doubled its staffing to handle revamped pre-flight ""pit stops"" for deeper cleaning and wants to ensure that tray tables and restroom door handles are germ-free with a new testing process, an executive told Reuters.
Airlines' efforts to reassure travelers of their safety during the pandemic have spurred a behind-the-scenes scramble to complete the enhanced cleaning that they are promising without sacrificing turnaround times, a cornerstone of profitability, once more passengers take to the skies.
""We've done quite a lot of change to our turn process,"" the head of Delta's new Global Cleanliness division Mike Medeiros said in an interview detailing the airline's strategy for ""turns"" -- the time a plane spends on the ground between flights.
Depending on the aircraft's size, Delta is deploying at least eight pre-flight cabin cleaners, up from three to five previously, and has adopted a new ""pit stop mentality"" based on industrial engineering studies into the extra resources required for cleaning each plane type, he said. 
After cleaners spray with disinfectant and wipe down high-touch surfaces, a flight attendant and gate agent walk the cabin together to inspect. If the cabin is not up to par, they call back the cleaners.
""Even if that means taking a delay to the flight,"" said Medeiros, who is among managers who receive daily cleanliness reports in their inbox based on customer surveys taken after every flight. 
""As important as (being) on-time is to our company, we know that cleanliness, particularly in this environment but also going forward, will be just as important,"" he said.
Delta's average clean time for its domestic fleet is now 20 minutes, up from 10 minutes to 15 minutes previously depending on the aircraft size, but it aims to speed up the procedure to protect its turn times once schedules are heavier by adding resources.
To verify levels of cleanliness, Delta is purchasing ATP test kits that measure the amount of bacteria on airplane and airport surfaces. The kits cannot test for COVID-19. 
It has already purchased 30 of the hand-held units, which cost about $1,000 each, to test the effectiveness of its cleaning program. The plan is to buy the tests for all of its global airport bases, though details are still being developed.
Among large U.S. rivals, American Airlines (O:AAL) said it has doubled the strength of its cabin cleaning crews but has not had to add extra time to its turns given lighter passenger loads and fewer scheduled flights. 
United Airlines (O:UAL) said it has added some extra time to its cleaning process but not workers given the lighter loads. 
Southwest Airlines (N:LUV), whose low-cost model depends on quick turns, has not added staffing and said this month it was scaling back some pre-flight cleaning with a view to preserving an average 45-minute turn once its schedule ramps up. It is still using an electrostatic and an anti-microbial spray that kill viruses and shield surfaces for 30 days, as well as a broad-spectrum disinfectant for lavatories and tray tables before every flight, but is not wiping down seat belts or arm rests. 
All of the airlines are eyeing new cleaning technology. United, for example, is testing ultraviolet sanitation deployed by drones and hand-held wands for airport and aircraft surfaces. Delta is rolling out antimicrobial LED light technology by Vital Vio in all its aircraft restrooms that will continuously prevent the growth of bacteria, fungi, mold and yeast. 
The airline is also in talks with  Boeing Co  (N:BA) and Airbus SE (PA:AIR) on developing touchless restrooms and is studying a UV light that would sterilize lavatories when they are not in use, Medeiros said.

Last week Delta said it would continue blocking middle seats through Jan. 6. Southwest is limiting seating capacity through October, while American and United are selling all seats. Beyond the jet, Delta is looking at bipolar ionization to improve air filtration at its airport facilities, including jetways. Airplanes already use hospital-grade HEPA that refresh air every two to four minutes. ""We're not afraid of adding costs to the business, but it has to add value,"" said Medeiros. ""If people are fearful or uncomfortable, travel won't come back in the near term.""

A KBA spokesman said on Monday the investigation involved petrol engines that Porsche, Volkswagen's (DE:VOWG_p) luxury sports vehicle unit, produced for the European market before 2017.
Porsche had confirmed a newspaper report on Sunday that it had informed the authorities after internal investigations uncovered suspected irregularities.
German prosecutors fined Porsche 535 million euros ($632 million) last year for lapses that allowed the company to cheat diesel emissions tests, but manipulation has not yet been proven for petrol engines.
A Porsche spokesman on Sunday said the issues relate to vehicles developed several years ago, adding there were no indications that current production was affected. The carmaker is working closely with authorities, he added.
Bild am Sonntag weekly had reported that the investigation was focused on engines developed between 2008 and 2013, including those of the Panamera and 911 models, with suspected illegal changes to hardware and software that could affect exhaust systems and engine components.
The paper also said that apart from discussions with employees, evidence was also being sought in the minutes of company meetings and hundreds of thousands of emails.

(Reuters) - Motiv Power Systems, which provides chassis and software systems for medium-duty trucks and buses, said on Monday it had secured $15 million in additional funding from GMAG Holdings Corp to fund technology and scaling up its manufacturing operations.
The latest funding follows a $60 million funding round last October led by GMAG, Motiv's main investor, and recreational vehicle maker  Winnebago Industries Inc  (N:WGO). Motiv has provided chassis for customers like Aramark (N:ARMK) and electrifies the E-450, a medium-duty truck made by  Ford Motor Co  (N:F).
Motiv's latest funding brings its total capital raised to $95 million.
Vehicle makers are scrambling to produce electric medium- and heavy-duty trucks with sufficient range for commercial customers seeking to switch away from traditional combustion engines.
While the electric passenger vehicle market has been dominated by Tesla Inc (O:TSLA), shipping and freight companies are still waiting for viable models to put into service.
The race to production for commercial electric vehicles was given fresh impetus in June when the California Air Resources Board (CARB) approved a groundbreaking policy to wean its trucking sector off diesel fuel by requiring manufacturers to sell a rising number of zero-emission vehicles, starting in 2024.
Major fleet operators have been looking to electrify for some time, but the CARB ruling ""makes it easier for them to persuade their internal constituents that they have to move quickly,"" Motiv Chief Executive Matt O'Leary told Reuters.
Motiv uses batteries from BMW (DE:BMWG) for its chassis, but the heart of its product is a software operating system and the electronics to operate the electric vehicle.

943,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 24, 2020 06:10AM ET</span>",StockBeat: AstraZeneca Gets a Booster Shot From Trump Report,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- Europe’s stock markets opened the week strongly, ostensibly on optimism about the rapid deployment of at least one vaccine to bring the Covid-19 pandemic under control.
The benchmark Stoxx 600 rose 1.7% to 371.24, a level that still leaves it nearly 2.5% below its post-pandemic high. In contrast to U.S. markets, which have regained momentum as a second wave of Covid-19 infections has faded, European stocks have plateaued in recent weeks as the reopening of the economy has prompted fears of another wave – even though infection rates have remained well below U.S. levels.
The Financial Times reported at the weekend that President Donald Trump is preparing to bypass normal drug authorization procedures to ensure that the vaccine being developed jointly by AstraZeneca (NYSE:AZN) and the University of Oxford can be made available before the U.S. elections on November 3rd.
The story came as the Food and Drug Administration issued emergency use authorization of convalescent plasma for treating Covid-19 patients. FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn said that the measure isn’t a full approval and the agency hasn’t finished evaluating evidence as to its effectiveness and safety.
Trump on Sunday had vented on Twitter against ‘deep state’ interests at the Food and Drug Administration who he claimed were slowing down the approvals process in order to stop him getting re-elected.  It’s unclear who he was referring to. Hahn was appointed by Trump himself.
Either way, AstraZeneca’s stock in London got a predictable boost from the news, rising 3.1% on a day when Europe’s main indexes were all up by more than 1.5%.
But for AstraZeneca, as for many other pharma and biotech companies racing to develop a cure for the coronavirus, the market now seems inoculated against its own hype.
AstraZeneca’s stock peaked over a month ago, at a level nearly 7% higher. Italy’s  DiaSorin  (LON:0GZX) stock remains over 20% below its May peak, Biontech (F:22UAy) stock listed in Germany is almost 30% down from its peak in July, despite a steady stream of positive trial results for the drug it is developing together with  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE).  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) stock in the U.S. is off 30%, not helped by the sight of company insiders heading for the exit within days of it dumping new shares on the public market, while  Novavax  (NASDAQ:NVAX) stock is languishing 24% below its peak.
In most of these cases, share prices peaked within days of July 16, when the U.S. hit what is – so far- its highest daily number of new infections at over 77,000. As confidence has grown that there will be no return to generalized lockdowns, the premium that the market has put on vaccine has fallen.
By that logic, the stocks could all rebound smartly if the reopening of schools in Europe and North America, combined with the onset of colder weather, turn case numbers higher again.
But the sector could live to rue the overt politicization of the drug approval process in the longer term. A poll by Yahoo and YouGov last month indicated that only 40% of U.S. adults would definitely take a vaccine that was approved in the current circumstances.
The risk of approving a vaccine that is either ineffective, or downright unsafe, is arguably small, but it is very clearly real. That would be a disaster as regards the containment of Covid-19. But discrediting the principle of vaccination, at a time when it is already under threat from so much unfounded conspiracy theory, would carry untold risks for public health for years to come."

Using metrics like one-year forward price-to-earnings ratio for equities and spreads for developed- and emerging-market credit, only a handful of assets including some currencies and EM bonds are currently inexpensive, according to John Normand, head of cross-asset fundamental strategy.
“The fairly valued ones are DM and EM credit plus Asian equities,” he wrote in a note last week. “The expensive ones are most other equities plus DM bonds and gold.”
The findings are part of JPMorgan’s assessment of asset valuations after relatively rapid rallies from the depths of Covid-19-fueled selloff. A multi-asset portfolio would be around fair value when factoring in both growth and quantitative easing, and fair-to-rich if gauged versus prior periods coming out of recessions, Normand found in separate analysis of shorter-term measures.
Risk premium metrics in many of the markets tend to revert to the mean over a period of years rather than weeks or months, so they’re useful to strategic rather than tactical investors, according to Normand.
Some assets, like developed-market bond yields, might not necessarily conform to those long-term mean-reversion patterns, he said. “Others (like P/Es in Tech and therefore the S&P 500) are undergoing structural re-rating only partly related to the monetary policy environment.”

946,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 24, 2020 05:55AM ET</span>",Global dividend plunge to be worst since financial crisis,"By Marc Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - The coronavirus crisis will see the world's biggest firms slash dividend payouts between 17%-23% this year or what could be as much as $400 billion, a new report has shown, although sectors such as tech are fighting the trend.
Global dividend payments plunged $108 billion to $382 billion in the second quarter of the year, fund manager Janus Henderson has calculated, equating to a 22% year-on-year drop which will be the worst since at least 2009. 
All regions saw lower payouts except North America, where Canadian payments proved to be resilient. Worldwide, 27% of firms cut their dividends, while worst affected Europe saw more than half do so and two thirds of those cancel them outright.
""2020 will see the worst outcome for global dividends since the global financial crisis,"" Janus Henderson said in a report published on Monday.
""We now expect headline global dividends to fall 17% in a best-case scenario, paying $1.18 trillion... Our worst-case scenario could see payouts drop 23% to $1.10 trillion."" (Graphic: Global dividends total since 2009 - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/bdwpkzddevm/Pasted%20image%201598005728376.png) 
A break down of the various sectors showed some big differences too.
Banks and other financial firm that have been ordered by the European Central Bank to stop paying dividends accounted for half of the 45% reduction in Europe's Q2 dividend drop to $77 billion.
Miners and oil firms were hit badly by the broad slump in commodity prices and consumer discretionary companies saw their operations hard hit by government lockdowns too, resulting in much lower payments.
In contrast, tech and telecoms and healthcare firms' dividends were relatively unaffected, with dividends up 1.8% and 0.1% respectively on an underlying basis. (Graphic: Banks, retailers and media dividends slammed but tech powering on - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/gjnpwayedpw/Pasted%20image%201598005233292.png) 
That big tech resilience has also helped Microsoft (O:MSFT) and Apple (O:AAPL) power their way into the top ten of world dividend payers for the first time this year. That list is still topped by Nestle (S:NESN). 
""Dividend trends are reflecting the trends in society and the stock market at the moment,"" said Janus Henderson's head of global equity income, Ben Lofthouse.
""Probably we are going to see increases from parts of the tech sector,"" he added. ""There are a lot of very strong balance sheets in that area.""
Going forward, he said, some key factors will determine how strong the recovery in dividends will be. 
The most obvious is the path of the coronavirus, but there is also what U.S. firms do later this year and whether Europe's banks get the green light early next year to restart their payments.
""The big question for the U.S. is what will happen in the fourth quarter. If many companies make significant cuts to their dividends, payouts will be fixed at a lower level until towards the end of 2021.""

(Reuters) - European stocks bounced from a two-week low on Monday as signs of progress in developing a COVID-19 treatment offset fears about a resurgence in virus cases across the continent that could risk stifling an economic recovery.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index (STOXX) rose 1.3%, mirroring gains for Asian markets after the U.S. health regulator said on Sunday it authorized the use of blood plasma from patients who have recovered from COVID-19 as a treatment.
Spain's  Grifols  (MC:GRLS), one of the world's top producers of treatments based on human plasma, gained 3%.
AstraZeneca Plc (L:AZN) jumped 2.5% after the Financial Times reported the Trump administration was considering fast-tracking an experimental COVID-19 vaccine being developed by the company.
""The weekend's vaccine news is at the fore,"" said Keith Temperton, an analyst at Lombard Forte. ""But we're in this mid-summer volume vacuum, where the path of least resistance is higher.""
Oil and gas companies (SXEP) led the surge in Europe, gaining from a rise in crude prices as storms closed in on the Gulf of Mexico, shutting more than half its oil production. [O/R]
Technology (SX8P), mining (SXPP) and chemical (SX4P) companies also rose nearly 2%.
British telecoms company BT Group (L:BT) jumped 4.3% after a media report that its board was preparing to defend it against takeover approaches from rivals and buyout firms.
The gains in European equities come after a lacklustre week that saw data pointing to a stalling business recovery in the euro zone amid a surge in coronavirus cases. 
A UK government data showed on Friday the reproduction ""R"" number of COVID-19 infections had risen and may now be above 1, indicating a risk that the overall epidemic is growing.
Similarly, Germany, France and Spain have seen a surge in virus cases, with their leaders looking at tightening travel restrictions.
""The way we're looking at the COVID narrative seems to be changing. The market is looking at a better situation in terms of hospitalisation and death rates,"" Temperton said.

Shares in British Airways-owner IAG (L:ICAG) dropped 0.5% and Air France (PA:AIRF) dipped 0.4% after the UK government said travellers to France are required to self-certify that they are not suffering coronavirus symptoms or have been in contact with a confirmed case within 14 days preceding travel.

U.S. futures indicated gains on Wall Street ahead, raising the prospect of record highs for the S&P 500.
Markets latched onto an announcement from the U.S. Food & Drug Administration for an ""emergency use authorisation"" which will allow the use of blood plasma from patients who have recovered from COVID-19 as a treatment for the disease.
""Whenever there is any news that is seen as something that is helping the battle against coronavirus it gives a boost to sentiment,"" said Shane Oliver, Sydney-based chief economist at AMP (OTC:AMLTF).
Equity market sentiment was also supported by a Financial Times report that the Trump administration is considering by-passing normal U.S. regulatory standards to fast-track an experimental coronavirus vaccine from the UK for use in the United States before the presidential election in November. 
Yet rising infection numbers in various parts of the world, especially Europe, cast a cloud over the latest gains, analysts said.

Looming large over this week was an address by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell at the Kansas City Fed Jackson Hole symposium, where he will speak on the Fed’s monetary policy framework review. 
""Fed chair Powell will speak (virtually) on the Fed’s Policy Framework Review, and we see a possibility for the Fed to shift to an average inflation target or at the least change its wording regarding inflation overshooting the target,"" SEB's Lina Fransson said in a note to clients. 
The risk-on mood also filtered through to fixed-income markets with safe-haven German bond yields ticking up after falling for six consecutive sessions last week, the longest decline since January. [GVD/EUR]

The euro was at $1.1800 after falling 0.5% on Friday following disappointing manufacturing activity data.

Storms bearing down on the Gulf of Mexico, shutting more than half its oil production, helped push up crude oil futures. Brent rose 26 cents to $44.61 a barrel and U.S. crude climbed 24 cents to $42.58. [O/R] Gold recovered from early losses to trade 0.4% higher at $1,947.20 an ounce.

Aug 5 (Reuters) - Blackstone Group (NYSE:BX) Inc BX.N said on Wednesday it agreed to acquire genealogy provider Ancestry.com Inc from private equity rivals for $4.7 billion, including debt, placing a big bet on family-tree chasing as well as personalized medicine.
Ancestry.com is the world's largest provider of DNA services, allowing customers to trace their genealogy and identify genetic health risks with tests sent to their home.
Blackstone is hoping that more consumers staying at home amid the COVID-19 pandemic will turn to Ancestry.com for its services.
""We believe Ancestry has significant runway for further growth as people of all ages and backgrounds become increasingly interested in learning more about their family histories and themselves,"" David Kestnbaum, a Blackstone senior managing director, said in a statement.
The deal is Blackstone's first acquisition out of Blackstone Capital Partners VIII, the largest-ever private equity fund that raised $26 billion from investors last year.
Ancestry.com has more than 3 million paying customers in about 30 countries, and earns more than $1 billion in annual revenue. Launched in 1996 as a family history website, it harnessed advances in DNA testing and mobile phone apps in the following two decades to expand its offerings.
Blackstone is buying Ancestry.com from private equity firms Silver Lake, Spectrum Equity and Permira. Singapore's sovereign wealth fund GIC, another Ancestry.com investor, said it will continue to maintain a significant minority stake in the company.
The acquisition's price tag represents a significant jump to Ancestry.com's valuation from four years ago, when Silver Lake and GIC invested in the Lehi, Utah-based company at a $2.6 billion valuation.

""We generate a high free cash flow that allows us to not only finance our dividend but to direct capital to other purposes,"" Narasimhan told the Swiss newspaper Neue Zuercher Zeitung.
Still, ""acquisitions have slowed recently from a structural perspective"" during the pandemic, he said. 
Narasimhan, a U.S. citizen who took over two years ago as CEO, acknowledged disappointment that Novartis' existing medicines had not proven more useful against COVID-19. For instance, the company, like others, abandoned a trial of its older malaria medicine hydroxychloroquine after it failed to help patients in scientific studies.
Moreover, he said Novartis had hoped to be faster in developing new drugs against COVID-19 and could have potentially profited from more cooperation with smaller biotech companies. ""We concentrated more on our own in-house activities - and learned a lesson from it,"" he said.
Many of the medicines that Novartis is supplying for patients stricken with COVID-19 come from its Sandoz generics unit. For now, Narasimhan said Novartis is not interested in selling Sandoz, but rather continuing work to boost its sales and profit margins squeezed by U.S. price pressure.
""We believe at this time that we can do this best with Sandoz within the Novartis group,"" he told the newspaper.
Novartis' share price has fallen 15% this year, compared to peer Roche Holding AG (OTC:RHHVF)'s 2% rise.
Beyond recent legal settlements in corruption cases that topped $1 billion, Narasimhan believes safety problems that emerged with new eye medicine Beovu have cost Novartis shares 10% of their value.

""Challenge No. 1 was Beovu's launch,"" he said.

Investing.com - European stock markets posted strong gains Monday, amid optimism after U.S. authorities signed off a new potential Covid-19 treatment, while BT Group (LON:BT) soared on takeover speculation.
At 3:40 AM ET (0740 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 1.4% higher, the CAC 40 in France rose 1.8% and the U.K.'s FTSE index was up 1.4%.
The U.S. Food and Drugs Administrations on Sunday said that it had issued ‘emergency use approval’ for the use of blood plasma from recovered patients as a treatment option for certain patients suffering from the effects of the Covid-19 virus.
Sentiment was also boosted by a Financial Times report that the U.S. administration is considering by-passing normal U.S. regulatory standards to fast-track an experimental coronavirus vaccine from the U.K. for use in America ahead of the presidential election. AstraZeneca (NYSE:AZN), the company developing this potential vaccine, gained 2.2%.
This comes as the global death toll from the coronavirus surpassed 800,000 over the weekend, with the U.S., Brazil, Mexico and India leading the rise in fatalities. 
Turning back to Europe, BT Group (LON:BT) stock soared 6.9% after the telecoms giant approached Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) to update its defense strategy from potential suitors, Sky News reported over the weekend. 
BT shares have been hurt after slashing its dividend, making it more vulnerable to a takeover, although the group has yet to receive an approach.
Elsewhere, Bunzl (OTC:BZLFY) stock rose 4% after the distribution and outsourcing company reinstated its dividend and posted a rise in pretax profit for the first half of 2020. Balfour Beatty (OTC:BAFYY) climbed 2% after the construction and engineering group said a joint venture it is involved in has received the contract to expand Hong Kong International Airport.
On the flip side,  Old Mutual  (LON:OMU) dropped 1.5% after the Johannesburg-based insurer posted a first-half loss with the coronavirus pandemic dragging South Africa’s economy deep into recession.
Oil prices edged higher Monday, as storms shut down more than half the Gulf of Mexico's oil production.
Hurricane Marco and tropical storm Laura wrought havoc in the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico, leading to over 58% of offshore oil production in the region being shut down.
However, the uncertainty surrounding the Covid-19 virus and the impact it will have on global growth continue to weigh on the crude demand outlook.
U.S. crude futures traded 0.7% higher at $42.63 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract rose 0.6% to $45.20. 
Elsewhere, gold futures rose 0.3% to $1,953.15/oz, continuing a second consecutive week of losses. EUR/USD traded 0.1% higher at 1.1810.

LONDON (Reuters) - Global education publisher  Pearson  (L:PSON) has appointed Andy Bird as its next chief executive, turning to a media veteran who helped build Walt  Disney 's (N:DIS) consumer digital business to see it through its latest transformation. 
Pearson said Bird was due to start his new job on Oct. 19, with current boss John Fallon remaining in the role until that date. Fallon, who had been due to step down this year, will then quit the board while remaining as an advisor until the end of the year. 
The British company, the world's biggest education publisher, has cut thousands of jobs and restructured over recent years to sell textbooks and courseware online, after a rapid move to digital sales sparked repeated profit warnings. 
""Because of (Bird's) experience and skills, he is extremely well placed to continue the transformation of Pearson, leading it to a new era of growth and enhancing value for all our shareholders,"" Chairman Sidney Taurel said. 
Earlier this year Pearson maintained its dividend payout to shareholders even as many major British companies were forced by the COVID-19 crisis to reduce their payouts, as the pandemic helped accelerate a shift to digital learning as schools and colleges shut.
Bird, who was chairman of Walt Disney International until 2018, is currently a non-executive director at Pearson and was appointed to the board on May 1.
 Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) said the appointment was likely to be taken positively but challenges remain. 

Bird will purchase shares in the company worth $3.75 million. His pay package which includes salary, a cash allowance and participation in an incentive plan, will need to be approved by shareholders at a special meeting, and his appointment remains conditional on that approval.

955,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 24, 2020 02:40AM ET</span>",Exclusive: ByteDance investors seek to use stakes to finance TikTok bid,"By Echo Wang and Joshua Franklin
(Reuters) - ByteDance investors are in talks to use their stakes in the Chinese technology firm to help finance their bid for its popular short-video app TikTok, according to people familiar with the matter.
ByteDance has been in talks to divest TikTok's North America, Australia and New Zealand operations to potential acquirers, including  Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT) and  Oracle Corp  (N:ORCL). President Donald Trump has ordered the Chinese company to sever ties with the social media app in the United States, citing concerns over the safety of the personal data it handles.
Some ByteDance investors, including investment firm General Atlantic, are vying to own large stakes in the TikTok assets for sale, the sources said. Under their restructuring plan, Microsoft or Oracle could receive a minority stake in the assets, the sources added.
The TikTok assets for sale could be worth between $25 billion and $30 billion, the sources said. To help fund their bid, the ByteDance investors are discussing exchanging some or all of their stakes in the Chinese company with equity in the TikTok assets, according to the sources. 
The ByteDance investors' plan faces long odds and significant hurdles, the sources said. Trump administration officials have said they expect a major U.S. company to lead the TikTok deal and ringfence the app technologically from ByteDance. A U.S. government panel, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), has to sign off on any deal that ByteDance reaches. 
Nevertheless, the push by some ByteDance investors for a bigger role in the TikTok deal underscores their efforts to give the Chinese company more options and avert a fire sale. Some of them had to convince ByteDance's founder and CEO Yiming Zhang to let go of TikTok, the sources said.
Microsoft remains the lead bidder for the TikTok assets because of its deep pockets and technical capacity to design new algorithms for TikTok that will be separate from ByteDance and its Chinese short video app Douyin, according to the sources.
Microsoft is working on a blueprint on how TikTok would be separated operationally from ByteDance after a deal is reached, which the Redmond, Washington-based company has said it hopes to ink by Sept. 15, the sources added. CFIUS would then monitor the implementation of the deal under a lengthy transition period, according to the sources.
The sources requested anonymity because the matter is confidential. TikTok and General Atlantic declined to comment, while ByteDance, Microsoft and Oracle did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
As relations between the United States and China deteriorate over trade, Hong Kong's autonomy, cybersecurity and the spread of the novel coronavirus, TikTok has emerged as a flashpoint in the dispute between the world's two largest economies.
While TikTok is best known for its anodyne videos of people dancing and going viral among teenagers, U.S. officials have expressed concerns that information on users could be passed on to China's communist government.
Trump has said he would support an effort by Microsoft to buy TikTok's American operations if the U.S. government got a ""substantial portion"" of the proceeds, but has also said there are other credible buyers such as Oracle. 
CRACKDOWN ON CHINESE-OWNED APPS
The White House has stepped up its efforts to purge what it deems ""untrusted"" Chinese apps from U.S. digital networks. Beyond TikTok, Trump has also issued an order that would prohibit transactions with Tencent Holding Ltd's (HK:0700) messenger app WeChat.
Earlier this year, Chinese gaming company  Beijing Kunlun Tech  Co Ltd (SZ:300418) sold Grindr LLC, a popular gay dating app it bought in 2016, for $620 million after being ordered by CFIUS to divest. ByteDance acquired Shanghai-based video app Musical.ly in a $1 billion deal in 2017 and relaunched it as TikTok the following year. ByteDance did not seek approval for the acquisition from CFIUS, which reviews deals for potential national security risks. Reuters reported last year that CFIUS had opened an investigation into TikTok. 
TikTok said last week it planned to file a lawsuit against an Aug. 6 executive order by Trump prohibiting transactions with the app and ByteDance.

ByteDance was valued at as much as $140 billion earlier this year when one of its shareholders, Cheetah Mobile (N:CMCM), sold a small stake in a private deal, Reuters has reported. The start-up's investors include Japan's SoftBank Group Corp (T:9984).

957,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 24, 2020 01:54AM ET</span>","A $91 Billion Asset Manager Dumps Exxon, Chevron on Climate","(Bloomberg) -- Norwegian life insurer Storebrand ASA has beefed up its climate policy, leading it to exit oil giants  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM). and  Chevron  Corp. (NYSE:CVX) and accelerate a full divestment from coal.
The move by the Oslo-listed company, which has about $91 billion under management, is another illustration of how investors are adjusting to the risks of climate change, putting pressure on fossil-fuel producers.
Storebrand has sold its holdings in Exxon and Chevron, chemicals giant BASF SE (OTC:BASFY) and miner Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO) Group for their lobbying efforts against the Paris Agreement and climate regulation, it said in a statement. It also quit ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) and Husky Energy (OTC:HUSKF) Inc because of their investments in polluting oil sands.
The lobbying assessment is based on the companies’ official positions, the organizations they’re a member of and how much resources they’ve invested in climate work, Jan Erik Saugestad, the head of Storebrand Asset Management, said in an interview. Although Exxon and Chevron have joined the global Oil and Gas Climate Initiative, they’ve set no firm targets for cuts across their emissions, as opposed to European rivals.
More oil divestments could follow, Saugestad said. European oil majors like BP (NYSE:BP) Plc, Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) Plc and Norway’s own Equinor ASA (NYSE:EQNR) can’t “rest easy and continue with business as usual,” he said.
The new policy also bans companies that get more than 5% of their revenues coal, a target Storebrand earlier planned to reach by 2026.
Small Divestment
Divestments as a result of the new policy were completed this year, Saugestad said, declining to be more specific. At a total of $47 million (almost half related to Exxon and Chevron alone), they represent a small share of Storebrand’s assets.
“The most important for us is to send a clear signal that we expect that the companies will cooperate with us,” Saugestad said. “In a global context, we’re quite a small player. But we’re also in a leading global position on sustainable investments.”
Storebrand has been at the forefront of a campaign to put pressure on Brazil to protect the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) forest, bringing together funds with more than $4.6 trillion in assets. It’s also removed all oil investments from its Swedish unit.

BEIJING/HONG KONG (Reuters) - Some of China's largest banks are set to post their first drop in first-half profits since the global financial crisis, hit by a surge in bad debt and higher loan-loss provisions due to the coronavirus pandemic, analysts and official data indicate.
The big five state banks including Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) (SS:601398), China Construction Bank (OTC:CICHF) (CCB) (SS:601939), and Bank of China (BoC) (SS:601988) kick off their earnings season on Aug. 28.
""Banks had it easy in the past, but now many signs indicate they're under great pressure,"" said Hong Hao, head of research at BoCom International. ""The pandemic has hit small businesses hard ... the balance sheets won't be pretty.""
Chinese commercial banks overall posted a 9.4% fall in first half net profit, while the six biggest posted a 12% profit fall from a year ago, according to China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (CBIRC) data.
China's cabinet said in June that authorities would push financial institutions to sacrifice 1.5 trillion yuan ($212 billion) in profit this year to support companies of all kinds by lowering lending rates and fees, and deferring loan payments.
The banking regulator has asked some state lenders to fully recognise bad loans on balance sheets and increase buffers for covering souring debt in the first half of the year, which will weigh on profits, two bankers from one of the lenders told Reuters.
In a rare move, some leading brokerages in China cancelled their forecasts for first-half bank earnings. One analyst, speaking to Reuters, cited uncertainties about ""profits each bank may sacrifice for the real economy"".
Some smaller banks are also being pushed by the regulator to take measures such as slashing bankers' salaries to shore up their balance sheets and face the ""tough days"", bankers have said previously.

In recent state media interviews, CBIRC chairman Guo Shuqing urged banks to set aside more cash as loan-loss buffers, and come up with ""realistic"" profit plans.
China's banking industry is expected to dispose of 3.4 trillion yuan ($490 billion) of bad loans in 2020 to contain financial risks in an economy weakened by COVID-19, the official Xinhua News Agency reported on Aug 13. 
The CBIRC and the banks did not immediately respond to requests for comment, but the regulator said in a Saturday statement that the banking sector has sacrificed more than 870 billion yuan in profit in the first seven months of 2020.
China's economy returned to growth in the second quarter after a deep virus-induced slump at the start of the year, but analysts say the recovery remains fragile. Regulators have been urging lenders to offer cheap loans and lend more to small businesses in order to support employment and growth.
""It's highly likely that banks will keep implementing some of the fiscal and monetary stimulus policies to counter the impact of COVID-19 in the second half of 2020,"" said Zhang Chi, rating director of Fitch Bohua, the rating agency's China unit.

""Lower interest rates, fee cuts, a lending push and loan payment forbearance measures will continue to squeeze the net interest margin of lenders.""

962,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 23, 2020 06:15PM ET</span>",EPA to OK American Airlines use of surface coating to fight COVID-19,"By David Shepardson and Tracy Rucinski
(Reuters) - The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is set to announce on Monday it will issue an emergency exemption to the state of Texas permitting it to allow  American Airlines Group  Inc (O:AAL) to use a new surface coating that kills coronaviruses for up to seven days, sources briefed on the matter said.
EPA officials said the agency would approve the emergency exemption requests under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) to allow the use of SurfaceWise2 — a product manufactured by Allied BioScience Inc - by both American Airlines and Texas-based Total Orthopedics Sports & Spine's two clinics for up to a year.
American Airlines declined to comment.
The announcement comes as airlines are struggling to convince people that it is safe to resume flying. EPA officials said the product was aimed at providing added protection in public spaces that could increase consumer confidence in resuming air travel.
EPA officials said the surface coating inactivated viruses and bacteria within two hours of application and kept working against them for up to seven days.
The EPA will allow the product's use at American Airlines airport facilities in Texas and on planes with flights originating in the state, the officials said, without providing more details. The initial application and any reapplication must occur in Texas.  
Allied BioScience plans to pursue a non-emergency approval by submitting additional data to meet the EPA’s registration requirements as an antiviral surface coating. If approved, the product would become available for purchase by the public, EPA officials said.
EPA officials emphasized the product was not a replacement for routine cleaning and disinfection. Facilities must continue to get regular cleanings.

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said it may be possible for a person to get COVID-19 ""by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes."" But the virus is believed to be spread primarily by close contact.

(Reuters) -  Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT) on Sunday said in a court filing that Apple Inc's (O:AAPL) threat to cut off the creator of ""Fortnite"" from Apple's developer tools would hurt Microsoft's gaming business, as well as other game developers.
The filing came in a dispute between Apple and Epic Games. Apple removed Epic's titles from its App Store after the game maker violated the iPhone maker's in-app payment rules.
Epic says that Apple has also threatened to cut off its access to Apple tools needed to maintain ""Unreal Engine,"" software that many game developers license to create better graphics. Microsoft said the move would hurt at least one of its own game titles called ""Forza Street"" that uses the engine for the iOS version of the game.
Kevin Gammill, Microsoft's general manager of gaming developer experiences, said Microsoft has an ""enterprise-wide"" license to Unreal Engine and that Apple's move would hamper it and other gaming firms' ability to make games with the technology for Macs and iPhones.
""If Unreal Engine cannot support games for iOS or macOS, Microsoft would be required to choose between abandoning its customers and potential customers on the iOS and macOS platforms or choosing a different game engine when preparing to develop new games,"" Gammill wrote.
Nicholas Penwarden, Epic's vice president of engineering, said in filing on Sunday that multiple Unreal Engine users - including at least one automotive design firm - have contacted the company with worries their projects will be disrupted.
Epic is seeking a court order to stop Apple's termination of its developer accounts. Apple has said that it will reverse its moves if Epic resubmits a version of ""Fortnite"" that complies with its payment rules. 

On Friday, Apple said in a filing that Epic unilaterally decided to break its rules after following them for more than a decade, calling Epic's removal from the App Store a ""self-inflicted wound.""

965,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 23, 2020 12:45PM ET</span>",Box Office: Russell Crowe's 'Unhinged' off to decent start as U.S. theaters slowly reopen,"By Rebecca Rubin
LOS ANGELES, (Variety.com) - After months-long cinema closures, the U.S. box office has opened to the most significant degree since pre-pandemic times.
Movie theaters in Florida, Texas, Georgia and other parts of the country that were able to safely reopen welcomed the first major theatrical premiere since March: Solstice Studios' ""Unhinged,"" a thriller starring Russell Crowe. The film played in 1,823 venues in North America, marking the widest release yet since the pandemic hit.
""Unhinged"" pocketed more than $4 million over the weekend, a promising result given the challenging environment. In normal times, that figure wouldn't be much to crow about. However, only a fraction of the nation's 6,000 movie theaters are currently in business -- and major markets like New York, California and New Jersey are still closed without a set date to reopen. The biggest ticket sales for ""Unhinged"" came from drive-ins in Los Angeles, San Francisco and Sacramento, as well as multi-screen theaters in Dallas, Houston, Chicago, Atlanta and Orlando. Solstice plans to expand the film to more than 2,300 cinemas in North America by next weekend.
""All things considered, this is a subdued opening,"" said David A. Gross, who runs movie consultancy FranchiseRe. He gives Solstice credit for taking a bold move in being the first new movie to open. On one hand, it doesn't have much competition among ticket buyers. But on the other, studios and exhibitors have yet to determine how eager audiences will be to return to the movies.
For their part, movie theaters have taken rigorous and expensive steps to ensure customers feel safe. They are keeping space between seats, limiting the number of tickets sold per movie and encouraging people to buy tickets online to reduce contact. They've also made hand sanitizer more readily available and ensured theaters will be cleaned more regularly. And patrons will be required to wear masks.
Solstice's head of distribution Shari Hardison says the company's goal is to hit $30 million at the box office by the end of its theatrical run in North America. After its performance this weekend, that is a benchmark she feels will be easily attainable. ""Unhinged"" cost $33 million to produce, not including marketing or distribution fees.
""We have a lot of stairs to climb, but the first steps are encouraging,"" she said.
Solstice president and CEO Mark Gill repeated a mantra that many in the movie business are looking to during the global heath crisis: ""Slow and steady wins the race.""
Given the sparse amount of movie theaters currently in operation and the potential that audiences could still feel uneasy being indoors (where the virus is said to spread faster), film distributors aren't expecting their films to have splashy opening weekends. Instead, they are counting on any given film to have a lengthier run on the big screen than it might normally have.
""We are pleased and relieved to see moviegoers took the first step to return to theaters this weekend,"" Gill said. ""As we have seen around the world -- and the light release schedule in the coming month suggests -- the movie will have a long run.""
Elsewhere, ""The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge on the Run"" collected another $550,000 from 326 locations in Canada, bringing its total haul to $2 million. The animated adventure based on the Nickelodeon cartoon isn't playing in U.S. theaters. It is expected to launch on premium video-on-demand next year before landing on the streaming service CBS All Access.
In the U.S., a number of indie films continued to populate drive-in theaters. This weekend, IFC Films launched ""Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA),"" a biographical drama starring Ethan Hawke as Nikola Tesla and Kyle McLaughlin as Thomas Edison. It generated $42,000 from 108 theaters, averaging out to $389 per location.
Dave Franco's thriller ""The Rental,"" also from IFC, again pulled in solid receipts. The movie amassed $108,000 from 105 theaters this weekend, boosting its domestic tally to $1.5 million.

Another new weekend release, teen drama ""Words on Bathroom Wall,"" made $462,050 from 925 screens. The film received an ""A"" CinemaScore from audiences and holds an 82% on review aggregation site Rotten Tomatoes -- two factors that its backers, Roadside Attractions and LD Entertainment, hope will point to positive word-of-mouth.
The process of restarting the exhibition industry has been delayed in many parts of the country as the virus continues to surge, but Warner Bros. is expecting a significant rollout for Christopher Nolan's sci-fi epic ""Tenet"" on Sept. 3. The weekend prior, Disney and Fox's superhero thriller ""The New Mutants"" is touching down in domestic theaters. Though the box office might be slow to reach pre-pandemic levels, analysts are optimistic that moviegoing will return.
""This weekend is the first step,"" Gross said. ""The next couple of weeks will show us a lot more. The rebuilding process is going to take nine to 18 months. Our belief in the long-term success of the theatrical business is unshaken.""

Britain introduced the digital services tax in April after slow progress in global negotiations over how to tax tech giants, many of which are U.S. companies. 
The tax is expected to raise about 500 million pounds ($654 million) a year for Britain's public finances.
That represents only a fraction of the 200 billion pounds in extra debt the country has racked up since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.
The tax is also a potential impediment to a post-Brexit bilateral trade deal between Britain and the United States.
France and other countries have adopted or are considering similar taxes.
No one was immediately available for comment at Britain's finance ministry. 
The Mail on Sunday quoted a finance ministry representative as saying: ""We've been clear it's a temporary tax that will be removed once an appropriate global solution is in place, and we continue to work with our international partners to reach that goal.""

Storms Marco and Laura are poised to become hurricanes and make back-to-back landfalls along the central Gulf Coast by mid-week. It is rare to have two simultaneously spinning in the Gulf and has raised concerns of double-barrel hits to coastal communities.
However, neither storm is expected to become a major hurricane, and their potential tracks cover a wide area of the Gulf Coast, said forecasters. 
 Murphy Oil Corp  (N:MUR) and BHP (AX:BHP) on Saturday were evacuating some workers and Royal Dutch Shell Plc (L:RDSa) began shutting oil and gas production at most of its offshore operations. Murphy was making plans for possible production cuts, the company said. 
 BP  Plc (L:BP) and  Chevron  Corp (N:CVX) began production shutdowns on Friday. Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY), the third largest Gulf of Mexico offshore producer, said it was implementing weather-related procedures.
Producers halted 240,785 barrels per day of oil production and 119 million cubic feet per day of natural gas output before noon on Saturday, said regulator U.S. Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement. 
Crews were evacuated from six production and four drilling rigs. Another seven drilling vessels were moved out of the storms' paths, BSEE reported. 
Storm Marco on Saturday was packing 65 mile per hour (100 km/h) winds, and was expected to become a Category One hurricane before making landfall in southeast Louisiana on Monday. Storm Laura is expected to become a Category One hurricane and reach the northern Gulf Coast a day or two after Marco. 
""We don't see the intensity and strengthening risk,"" said Matt Rogers (NYSE:ROG), president of Commodity Weather Group, which advises energy and agricultural firms. The prospect of either becoming a damaging, Category Three storm is just 10%, he said. 
Unlike Hurricane Harvey, which struck the region three years ago, neither is expected to linger inland, he said, reducing risk of coastal flooding. 
Helicopters on Saturday were crisscrossing the Gulf of Mexico, ferrying workers off platforms in precautionary measures, said Tony Hermans, base manager at Bristow Galliano heliport in southern Louisiana. Scheduled evacuations will be completed by Sunday, he said. 
U.S. Gulf of Mexico offshore wells account for 17% of total U.S. crude oil production and 5% of total U.S. natural gas production. The region along the Texas to Mississippi coasts also accounts for 45% of total U.S. petroleum refining capacity. 

Louisiana Offshore Oil Port, a major oil export and import terminal, reported it had begun implementing weather procedures.

Porsche has informed Germany's automotive watchdog KBA, the Stuttgart prosecutor's office, as well as U.S. authorities of suspected illegal changes to hardware and software that could affect exhaust systems and engine components, the paper said.
""Porsche is regularly and continuously reviewing technical and regulatory aspects of its vehicles,"" a Porsche spokesman said. ""As part of such internal examinations Porsche has identified issues and has, just like in the past, proactively informed authorities.""
The spokesman said that the issues relate to vehicles developed several years ago, adding that there were no indications that current production was affected. The carmaker is working closely with authorities, he said.
BamS, not citing where it obtained the information, said that engines developed between 2008 and 2013 were the subject of the investigation, including those of the Panamera and 911 models.

The paper also said that apart from discussions with employees, meeting protocols and hundreds of thousands of emails were being examined in search of evidence, adding KBA has launched an official investigation.

The announcement, which confirms what people with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters in December, was announced on the website of the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (CBIRC) on Saturday.

The deal comes as China's government looks to open up its financial market to foreign firms, offering potentially rich rewards for international fund managers and others in the broader financial sector.
Top global financial players have long sought to increase their presence in the relatively fast-growing Chinese economy, and in October last year China scrapped some restrictions on foreign banks' operations in the country.
Two months later France-based Amundi, Europe's largest asset manager, and Bank of China Wealth Management won approval from Chinese regulators to set up a joint venture, while banks including UBS (S:UBSG) and JPMorgan Chase (N:JPM) have won approval to set up majority-owned China ventures.

973,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 22, 2020 06:55AM ET</span>",Point/Counterpoint: The Case for Gilead,"By Geoffrey Smith and Christiana Sciaudone
Investing.com -- It's been a rough week for Gilead.
The Federal Drug Administration shocked the pharmaceutical maker and its shareholders when it rejected an expected blockbuster arthritis drug until more data about its effects was available. Analysts said it could delay the drug, filgotinib, into next year.
Gilead does have a promising Covid-19 treatment, remdesivir, that is expected to drive as much as $3.5 billion in revenue. And it has its HIV treatments that still make up the bulk of sales. But the short-term case for Gilead shares is hard to argue.
Investing.com's Geoffrey Smith writes about the upside for Gilead, while Christiana Sciaudone explains the bear case. This is Point/Counterpoint.
Bull Case: Setback means the stock is priced attractively
Gilead (NASDAQ:GILD) is that it is a company with a well-established track record of solid growth and decent shareholder returns that, after the latest setback, is now priced attractively.
Moreover, the knee-jerk decline in response to Wednesday’s news about filgotinib is overdone. The company still has a chance to address the FDA’s concerns, and the U.S. regulator’s decision need not stop it being approved in other jurisdictions such as Europe, where it has already received a positive if non-final opinion from a key committee.
At Thursday’s closing price, the shares yielded over 4%, and regular buybacks over the years have generally juiced shareholder returns by a couple more percentage points.
There is no obvious short-term risk to that record. Revenue from remdesivir, the investigational antiviral drug that some (but not all) studies indicate results in speedier recovery from the Covid-19 virus, has started to flow as of July 1 (it gave away all its stockpiles to the U.S. government in the first half).
At over $2,400 per five-day course for Medicare and $3,120 per course for private healthcare companies, that will soon add up, given that over 40,000 Americans are still being diagnosed every day for the virus, and hospitalizations run above 10% of cases in most districts. Depending on how the virus progresses, revenue of more than $2 billion in the rest of 2020 is quite realistic. RBC analyst Brian Abrahams says as much as $3.5 billion is possible.
Moreover, on the assumption that the medical establishment finally does get Covid-19 under control, its still-potent stable of antiviral drugs for HIV, as well as its hepatitis drug will soon overcome the dip in revenue caused by vulnerable patients staying away from their doctors’ clinics in the first half of the year.
Longer-term, the company also has a powerful and growing degree of optionality on a range of oncology drugs, as illustrated by this month’s agreement with immunotherapy specialist Tizona, which gave it the option to buy Tizona out for a total consideration of $1.55 billion. Such deals aren’t risk-free, as the failure to get filgotinib approved so far shows, but its partner in that project, but are still a rational, risk-adjusted approach to renewing the portfolio.
Bear case: A company forced to rest on its laurels
Gilead is a company forced to rest on its laurels, especially now that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said, ""Not yet!"" to what was supposed to be its big new blockbuster drug.
Filgotinib should have been a billion-dollar smash hit and it still might, just not any time soon. 
“There’s really no way to sugarcoat this very surprising development,” Barclays analysts said in a note. They cut their peak sales estimate for the drug to about 527 million euros from 1.3 billion euros, Bloomberg reported. “This is essentially the bear-case scenario playing out.”
The expectations for filgotinib were high. While it takes five to 10 years to bring a drug to market, once there, it could see $5 billion in peak revenue, said Hartaj Singh, managing director at Oppenheimer who specializes in biotechnology. Singh has a buy rating on the company, seeing it as cheap for what it has to offer in the long-term, but he said he sees how short-term investors may not see things the same way.  
""This is a product that, even if it gets approved, will grow very, very slowly for the next three to five years,"" Singh said in a telephone interview. 
Also, consider that AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV) already has a Janus kinase inhibitor drug out on the market to treat rheumatoid arthritis, Rinvoq, for adults with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis, according to a June 4 article on DocWire News. 
And let's look at Gilead's current stale stable of treatments. HIV treatments represent the bulk of Gilead's sales, with $8.1 billion of $10.7 billion in revenue in the first half coming from that segment. Where's the future? 
Most analysts agree that the Foster City, California-based company isn't all that. While 10 say buy, 11 say hold and one says sell. 
A potential bright spot should be Veklury, previously known as remdesivir, which received emergency use authorization from the FDA for treatment of Covid-19. But the data is still uncertain, and it will take a while to figure out its efficacy. 
A way out for Gilead could be some kind of partnership. In June, AstraZeneca (NYSE:AZN) was said to make an approach to merge with Gilead.  
Combining AstraZeneca's worldwide heft and focus on more primary-care diseases with Gilead's hyper focus on infectious diseases could yield benefits, Singh said. Their combined focus on oncology has little overlap and could also yield an oncology powerhouse.
But AstraZeneca has a high valuation without an attractive pipeline (kind of like Gilead) and current Gilead shareholders would stand to benefit little, Singh said. 
In short, there are no near-term benefits to buying Gilead. Traders seeking a faster return will want to look elsewhere.

975,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 21, 2020 08:50PM ET</span>",Factbox: What's at stake in California's November gig worker ballot measure,"By Tina Bellon
(Reuters) - After a California appeals court on Thursday halted a law requiring the reclassification of ride-hail drivers of Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc and  Lyft  Inc (NASDAQ:LYFT) as employees, the decision over gig worker benefits and pay will likely be left to voters.
Here is a look at the main points of Proposition 22, the ballot measure California voters will decide on Nov. 3:
- HOW DO GIG WORKERS DIFFER FROM TRADITIONAL EMPLOYEES?
Most government regulations and safety net benefits including minimum wage, health insurance, sick pay, workers' compensation and unemployment insurance are attached to an employment relationship.
Gig economy companies Uber, Lyft, GrubHub (NYSE:GRUB) Inc, DoorDash Inc and Postmates save money by not paying costly benefits and offloading some of the traditional employer-side responsibilities to their workers.
Gig workers in turn enjoy the flexibility to work whenever they want. The companies say the majority of workers use their services to supplement income from other full or part-time jobs that offer benefits. 
- WHO SPONSORED THE BALLOT MEASURE?
Uber, Lyft, DoorDash, Instacart and Postmates began working on a ballot measure in August 2019, when California lawmakers were readying a bill that makes it harder for companies to classify workers as independent contractors, instead of employees. 
The law, Assembly Bill 5 (""AB5""), was implemented in January with broad support from organized labor and requires companies to classify workers as employees if they controlled how workers do their jobs, or the work is part of their normal business.
Uber, Lyft, DoorDash, Instacart and Postmates have argued the law does not apply to them. They are spending more than $110 million to support Proposition 22. 
- WHAT DOES PROPOSITION 22 ENTAIL?
The ballot measure would enshrine drivers' current contractor status, albeit with some added benefits.
Under the proposal, gig workers would receive guaranteed pay equal to 120% of minimum wage; 30 cents per mile compensation for expenses; health care subsidies on a sliding scale to drivers who work at least 15 hours a week and are enrolled in a health plan; occupational accident and injury insurance.
The ballot also includes anti-discrimination and sexual harassment protections for drivers and mandates the companies to conduct criminal background checks of app-based drivers.
- WHY DO THE COMPANIES SUPPORT THE MEASURE?
The companies say roughly 80% of all drivers work less than 20 hours per week. Being forced to reclassify workers as employees would threaten the companies' business models and force them to reduce driver numbers by up to 90%.
An employee-based model would likely also increase the cost of these services for consumers and potentially result in longer wait times, the companies say.
- WHAT DO OPPONENTS SAY?
Opposition to Proposition 22 mainly comes from organized labor and many California lawmakers who say the companies' proposal would create a new underclass of workers.
Drivers would only receive minimum pay during the time they actually have a passenger in the car, but studies and city data have shown drivers spend roughly a third of their time waiting for a new trip request or driving to a new passenger.
Labor groups also say the companies underestimate the cost of owning and operating a ride-hail vehicle, rendering the 30 cents per mile compensation insufficient. 

Critics also say the health care stipend and occupational accident insurance fall short of regular sick leave and workers' compensation. Workers would also not be entitled to unemployment insurance under the companies' plan - one of the costly benefits that has come into focus during the coronavirus pandemic.

976,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 21, 2020 08:50PM ET</span>","Wall Street Week Ahead: No elk or trout, but Fed's virtual retreat may stoke market's 'animal spirits'","By David Randall and Karen Brettell
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors could get a hint from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell next week about how aggressively the U.S. central bank will try to manage the long-term recovery from the coronavirus pandemic.
Powell will discuss the Fed's monetary policy framework review - a review it has been undertaking for nearly two years into how it conducts monetary policy - on the opening day of the Kansas City Fed's annual symposium on Thursday.
Since the 2007-2009 financial crisis, Fed chiefs have used their keynote speaking appointment at the conference - not being held this year in the hunting and fishing resort of Jackson Hole, Wyoming, for the first time in nearly four decades because of the pandemic - to signal important shifts in monetary policy or the economic outlook. 
The market backdrop this time around could hardly be less dramatic. Spurred by Fed buying of assets, stocks have recovered their entire pandemic-related losses and are trading around record highs, while bond yields have been near record lows. 
""The stock market is telling you there is asset price inflation occurring when there is still a lot of underlying weakness in the economy. I think the Fed is unlikely to view that as a signal of success on policy and, therefore, decide there is nothing more to do,"" said Tony Rodriguez, chief fixed income strategist at Nuveen.
A major question - particularly ahead of the Fed's September policy meeting - is whether the central bank will shift its inflation targets to an average, which would allow inflation to run higher than previously expected before interest rates are raised. 
""We fully expect that they are going down the path of average inflation targeting,"" said Bob Miller, head of Americas Fundamental Fixed Income at BlackRock (NYSE:BLK).
'RIGHTLY CONCERNED'
Investors have been increasing their bets on inflation in reaction to the roughly $9 trillion in stimulus measures from central banks worldwide. Gold, a popular hedge against inflation and a falling U.S. dollar, is up 28% for the year to date and near record highs, while the dollar has fallen close to two-year lows. 
Benchmark 10-year Treasury yields hit near record lows of 0.504% earlier this month, before backing up to 0.638% after a rash of Treasury supply.
Real yields for the notes, which show yield returns after adjusting for expected inflation, dropped this month to a record low of minus 1.11%.
The shift to looking at an average measure of inflation would be a ""big deal"" and help the central bank avoid the same negative interest rate policies adopted by central banks in Europe and Japan, Miller said.
The Fed is trying to spur inflation over the next several years in order to prevent a deflationary spiral as the global economy struggles to right itself from the COVID-19 shock.
""The Fed is rightly concerned about the unstable economic recovery so far and the degree to which we still need to absorb the job losses over the last five months,"" said Gene Tannuzzo, deputy global head of fixed income at Columbia Threadneedle.
An average inflation target would allow inflation to make up for the periods in which it fell below the Fed's target. The Fed, like most central banks, shoots for 2% inflation but has failed to meet that target for most of the past decade. With interest rates near historic lows, the central bank has fewer ways to help stimulate the economy. 
Minutes from the Fed’s July meeting released on Wednesday showed that one tool to keep borrowing costs low - yield curve control - was likely off the table for now, but some think that the Fed could shift some of its buying to longer-dated debt. 
    Investors will also likely be looking for signs that the Fed is exploring additional ways to support the global economy should a stimulus package fail in Congress, Rodriguez said.

    ""If we get to a point where there is no stimulus package and no additional unemployment support, then the Fed will definitely feel like they have more to do,"" Rodriguez said.

SEATTLE (Reuters) - Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co said on Friday it is developing a hand-held wand that emits ultraviolet light to neutralize bacteria and viruses, part of a suite of methods to disinfect flight deck surfaces and controls, as well as surfaces throughout the cabin.
Concerns by airline workers and passengers about the spread of COVID-19 has fueled a rush by companies to roll out new technology for aircraft sanitization. 
The wand would eliminate the need for using alcohol or other disinfectants that could damage sensitive electronic equipment, Rae Lutters, chief engineer for Boeing's ecoDemonstrator program, told a media briefing. 
Boeing is looking at licensing the technology and hiring third-party companies in the fall to begin manufacturing the wands for commercial use, it said. 
Boeing has been working on the technology with 13 different airlines. Kevin Callahan, a Boeing technical fellow leading testing of the wand prototype, cited ""very strong interest"" as carriers think about restoring confidence in flying as the COVID-19 pandemic subsides.
Under heightened cleaning practices, many airlines have started using electrostatic disinfectants, which kill viruses on contact, as well as an anti-microbial spray that forms a coating for 30 days. 
Boeing is also testing an anti-microbial coating for aircraft surfaces.

The third largest U.S. bank has so far sued a dozen firms after an ""operational error"" that caused it to transfer $900 million of its own funds to Revlon creditors one day after the troubled cosmetics company was sued over its restructuring tactics.
Several hundred million has already been returned the bank, Citi said in an emailed statement. But it has had to take legal action to recover over $500 million from lenders who are refusing to return the payment.

U.S. business activity snapped back to the highest since early 2019 in August, according to IHS Markit surveys, as companies in both manufacturing and services sectors saw a resurgence in new orders.
Another report showed U.S. home sales rose at a record pace for a second straight month in July and home prices hit all-time highs.
The unexpectedly sharp increases in Markit's indexes extend a pattern of choppy U.S. economic data this week - including weekly jobless claims - that paint a picture of a fitful recovery from the COVID-19 recession.
""It's not surprising to see a pickup in manufacturing as the economy has started to reopen, even though pockets of the country have pulled back on their reopenings,"" said Lindsey Bell, chief investment strategist at Ally Invest. ""It’s an encouraging sign and it supports the upside we have seen in the markets.""
Apple Inc (O:AAPL) rallied over 5% as its market value continued to swell after the most valuable publicly listed company in the world crossed the $2 trillion milestone this week. The iPhone maker boosted the S&P 500 and Nasdaq more than any other company on Friday.
Bets that technology-focused companies including Apple and Amazon.com (O:AMZN) will emerge stronger from the pandemic set the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq on track to close out the week higher.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The Singapore-registered company that says it is close to buying English soccer club Newcastle United admits it doctored photos of former U.S. President Barack Obama in marketing materials used to publicize the newly formed group.
Bellagraph Nova Group (BN Group) also said some of the information in those materials was released prematurely or contained errors after Reuters found inconsistencies when speaking to firms and persons BN Group says it is involved with. 
Speaking on behalf of BN Group's principals, Nereides Antonio Giamundo de Bourbon, head of investor relations, acknowledged that the company had altered photos of Obama to make it look as though he had attended a meeting with its executives in Paris.
His admission came on Wednesday in response to questions from Reuters.
BN Group has now removed the photos from its website.
However, Bourbon denied that the company had deliberately made any false claims about certain aspects of its business. 
The company, which says it had a turnover of $12 billion last year and describes itself in marketing materials as the ""world's fastest growing conglomerate"", has said on its website and in press releases that it is headquartered in Paris.
No company called Bellagraph Nova Group is registered in France, according to official online records checked by Reuters on Friday. Reuters could not find any company by that name at the address it has given - 10 Place Vendome - when a reporter visited on Tuesday. 
A receptionist at an office rental business operated by Regus in the building said BN Group has used its space but its staff were not always present. Bourbon maintained to Reuters that BN Group had a permanent office in Place Vendome.
In addition, the group, which was incorporated in Singapore last month, has said financial technology firm - Hydra X - is one of the entities in its global empire and that it is implementing a trading system for the Singapore Exchange (OTC:SPXCY).
Hydra X has denied both those claims. The Singapore Exchange has also denied Hydra X is implementing a trading system.
'PHOTOSHOP PICTURE'
BN Group's website and press releases in recent weeks have featured photos of Obama with the firm's owners, Singaporean businessmen Terence and Nelson Loh, and Evangeline Shen, a Chinese jewellery merchant and former  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) banker.
While Shen and the Lohs had photos taken with Obama at a charity event they sponsored in Singapore on Dec. 14, BN Group's Bourbon said some of the photos published in press releases on its website and sent to media had been edited to make it look as though Obama was in a private meeting. 
""We are serious people ... the only ambiguous thing has been the photoshop picture,"" he said. ""There wasn't any malicious aim behind it."" 
Shen declined to be interviewed for this story. The Loh cousins did not respond to requests for comment.
The charity event where the photos of Obama were taken was sponsored by Novena Global Lifecare, a Singapore healthcare company founded in 2010 by the Loh cousins.
The photographer who took the pictures confirmed to Reuters that they were taken at the gala event in Singapore.
Obama's office and the Obama Foundation did not respond to requests for comment about the photos or the BN Group.
The company grabbed global headlines on Aug. 15 when it announced it had submitted a takeover bid for one of England's most high-profile soccer clubs, adding that it had enlisted the help of Newcastle legend and former England Captain Alan Shearer as well as another former player, Michael Chopra, in its bid. 
The surprise announcement adds to years of speculation over the future of Newcastle United, which has been the subject of several fruitless takeover bids, including a $390 million Saudi-backed deal that collapsed last week.
If BN Group's bid is accepted, the English Premier League would then carry out its owners and directors test which involves looking into the backgrounds of the people involved to assess their suitability to own a soccer club.
Newcastle United declined to comment on the bid or BN Group. The club's owner, Mike Ashley, did not respond to requests for comment.
Shearer's management told Reuters he was not involved in the takeover bid. Chopra, who on Aug. 14 retweeted a picture of himself at the offices of BN Group, did not respond to a request for comment.
HYDRA X
A firm called Bellagraph Nova Pte Ltd - which lists the Lohs and Shen as its three directors and shareholders - was incorporated in Singapore on July 20 and is registered to an office above a row of shops in the city-state. 
BN Group has said on its website and in marketing materials that it is a French company with an office in Paris at 10 Place Vendome, an exclusive square home to the Ritz Paris hotel and luxury stores such as Chanel and Louis Vuitton.
Reuters found no record of any company registered in France called Bellagraph Nova Group on the online database of the Registries of the Commercial Courts, the French state agency that holds company information.
Singapore-based Hydra X is one of the entities BN Group has said in marketing materials sent to Reuters on Monday is part of its global conglomerate of 23,000 employees.
It said in those materials that Hydra X was ""designing and implementing"" a trading system for the Singapore Exchange.
When contacted for comment, Hydra X and the exchange denied this. Bourbon said there had been a mistake in translating the company's description in its marketing documents.
Hydra X said BN Group was not a shareholder. It said in an emailed statement to Reuters that it was privately owned, predominantly by individual investors, and that it shared no legal or beneficial owners with the BN Group, nor was part of, or a subsidiary, of the BN Group. 
Hydra X said it had entered ""into a joint venture with a related entity"" of BN Group to build technology solutions unrelated to financial technology. It declined to name the entity.
Bourbon maintained to Reuters that Hydra X was owned by BN Group and was in the process of merging into the group. He said sharing further details would break non-disclosure agreements.
""Sometimes the marketing moves faster than the process,"" he said.
NETX LISTING
BN Group's official Instagram account also says one of its entities, a robotics company called NETX, is listed in Singapore and on New York's Nasdaq exchange.
Reuters found no record of a company called NETX on those exchanges. Bourbon said they had announced the listings ""prematurely"" but they were underway.
Without elaborating further, the Singapore exchange referred Reuters to a filing in which a company listed on its junior bourse, bought by the Loh's investment company DORR Group last month, has proposed to change its name to NETX later in August. 
Nasdaq did not respond to requests for comment.
BN Group's modest Singapore office - on the top floor of a four-storey building above a pet shop and an Indian restaurant - is also the address of Novena Global Lifecare and other firms it owns such as a fine wine merchant and an investment manager.
When Reuters visited the office on Thursday, there was nobody at the reception desk. In the hallway stood a dormant, shoulder-height robot like the ones used in online marketing campaigns for NETX.
A woman, who came out of a glass-walled meeting room to speak to Reuters, said neither the Lohs nor Shen were present.

Bourbon said the Singapore-registered Bellagraph Nova company at that address was the parent firm. ""We started from Singapore but we are moving all our realty to Europe.""

985,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 21, 2020 01:45PM ET</span>",Fed Has Used Only a Fraction of Its Main Street Lending Facility,"(Bloomberg) -- The Federal Reserve has used only a fraction of the $600 billion in an emergency lending program for small and medium businesses struggling with the Covid pandemic, according to a congressional watchdog report.
Eligible lenders participating in the Main Street program have issued $496.8 million in loans, of which $472 million is Federal Reserve money, or about 0.07% of the central bank’s lending capacity as of Wednesday, according to the report issued Friday.
“The Main Street Lending Program has seen modest initial activity thus far,” according to a monthly report from the Congressional Oversight Commission, the panel in charge of overseeing the Treasury Department and Federal Reserve responses to the coronavirus pandemic.
“Some of the Main Street Lending Program’s modest activity may be because some businesses accessed the Small Business Administration’s (SBA) Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), while others are able to rely on existing credit lines or other sources of liquidity,” the report said.
The watchdog panel noted several other reasons why businesses may not be seeking the funding: only 160 of the 522 lenders registered with the program have publicized that they are accepting loan applications with new customers; businesses are unfamiliar with the program; and that the eligibility rules are complex and may exclude some businesses that wish to participate.
The Fed has defended the lending levels for Main Street program, saying that there isn’t huge demand for loans currently but that it could consider re-evaluating the eligibility requirements as conditions change.
Later Demand
Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren, whose bank manages the lending facility, told the panel earlier this month that the program will likely see more demand from small and mid-size businesses if the pandemic continues dragging down the economy.
The program buys up to 95% of individual loans made under it by private banks to businesses.
Interest rates on the loans, set at the London interbank offered rate plus 3 percentage points, may be attractive to high-risk borrowers, but companies that have fared relatively well through the pandemic may be able to access cheaper financing elsewhere, Rosengren said.
The oversight commission was created at the insistence of congressional Democrats during negotiations that led to approval of the $2.2 trillion CARES Act stimulus package in March.
The oversight panel has four members: Democratic Representative Donna Shalala of Florida; GOP Senator Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania; Bharat Ramamurti, a former aide to Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts; and GOP Representative French Hill of Arkansas.
Members have said the lack of a chairman has hampered the panel’s ability to establish a strategy for policing the $500 billion in bailout money. Joseph Dunford, a former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, withdrew from consideration for the post.

(Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) on Friday said its longtime executive and consumer chief Jeff Wilke plans to retire after more than two decades with the company, a decision that appeared to take him out of line to succeed CEO and founder Jeff Bezos.
Dave Clark, 47, another Amazon veteran who has run the retailer's supply chain and delivery operations, will step into Wilke's role, the company said in a filing. Wilke aims to retire in the first quarter of next year to explore personal interests, he said in a note to staff that was shared with Reuters.
Wilke, 53, is Amazon's second-highest ranking officer along with Andy Jassy, who is chief executive of the company's cloud computing division. That made Wilke a contender to take over the top job from Bezos, 56, if he were to leave. Amazon declined to comment on succession plans.
Bezos, who became the world's richest person as Amazon's stock soared, said in another note to staff that Wilke's ""legacy and impact will live on long after he departs.""
Wilke joined Amazon as vice president in 1999 when the young company still sent corporate workers to help pack orders during the holiday shopping season. Now, he oversees a range of businesses including online and physical stores and the loyalty club Prime, which helped make Amazon the world's largest internet retailer.
Wilke said in his note that he does not have a new job and is ""as happy with and proud of Amazon as ever,"" but he wants to move on and step aside for others.
Clark, who will take over, currently is Amazon's senior vice president of worldwide operations. He built out the company's air cargo fleet and last-mile service that now delivers more packages for Amazon than any other U.S. carrier.

The company last month posted its biggest profit ever, as sales surged during the COVID-19 pandemic.

987,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 21, 2020 01:27PM ET</span>",Botox Battle Rages With Upstart Evolus Backed by Dermatologists,"(Bloomberg) -- Evolus (NASDAQ:EOLS) Inc. is getting support for its legal battle with  AbbVie Inc  (NYSE:ABBV).’s Allergan (NYSE:AGN) over a rival to the Botox wrinkle treatment from dermatologists tired of an “800-pound gorilla” controlling the beauty market.
More than four dozen dermatologists have written to the U.S. International Trade Commission, asking it to allow Botox rival Jeuveau to stay on the U.S. market. A trade judge in July recommended a 10-year ban on imports of Korean-made Jeuveau, saying it was created using a stolen formula.
Allergan and its Korean partner Medytox Inc. have claimed that Evolus and its partner, Daewoong Pharmaceutical Co., developed Jeuveau using a stolen trade secret for a way to turn the deadly botulinum toxin into a wrinkle treatment. Evolus says an import ban of its only product would be “catastrophic” to the company. The dermatologists say some patients prefer Jeuveau, citing its performance, duration and lower price.
The doctors said they’ve been able to expand into new markets, such as with millennials, because of Jeuveau. Evolus said that’s benefited all participants -- including Allergan -- and noted analysts predict the overall market will double by 2025.
“Without Evolus, Allergan pretty much has free reign in the marketplace,” Mark Koepsell, a Fort Collins, Colorado, spa owner said in one letter. In another, 40 dermatologists from across the nation said they “don’t like when an 800-pound gorilla tries legal tactics to eliminate a small competitor.”
The commission is scheduled to announce Sept. 21 whether it will review or let stand the judge’s findings. The dermatologists’ letters were filed earlier this week, as were ones from law scholars debating whether the case belongs before the U.S. trade agency.
‘Dangerous’ Expansion
Evolus and Daewoong said the dispute is already being considered in Korean courts and urged the U.S. agency to reject Allergan and Medytox’s case.The judge’s findings “over this Korean dispute about alleged Korean trade secrets constitutes a dangerous and unprecedented expansion of the commission’s jurisdiction,” Evolus said. The ITC’s role, Evolus said, is as “an enforcer safeguarding American innovations.”
Allergan and Medytox contend that a former Medytox employee handed over to Daewoong the results of its “meticulous, time-consuming, and expensive research” into a new process to make a beauty treatment based on one of the world’s deadliest toxins.
The process to turn the toxin into Botox, which also is used to treat chronic migraines and urinary incontinence, has been a closely kept secret by Allergan, allowing it to maintain its dominance since it was first approved for sale in 1989.
The trade secret at dispute is for a next-generation drug developed with Medytox for a liquid-type version called MT10109L that’s seen as easier to use than Botox.
Allergan and Medytox said the stolen secrets were used to create “a product that is specifically targeted at disrupting and gaining a substantial share of the domestic market,” which puts the case in the ITC’s jurisdiction.
The case is In the Matter of Certain Botulinum Toxin Products, Complaint No. 337-3359, U.S. International Trade Commission (Washington).

(Reuters) - Moderately ill COVID-19 patients saw their condition improve after a 5-day course of  Gilead Sciences Inc  (NASDAQ:GILD)'s remdesivir, but a 10-day course did not show a benefit and the drug did not significantly shorten hospital stays, according to new data.
The 600-patient analysis, published on Friday by the Journal of the American Medical Association, found that moderately-ill patients treated with the antiviral drug for up to 5 days had significantly higher odds of improvement compared to patients given standard treatment. But researchers said the clinical importance of the benefit was uncertain.
Remdesivir is currently used under an emergency use authorization from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for treating patients hospitalized with severe COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus. Gilead earlier this month filed an application seeking full FDA approval of the drug.

The drug, which was shown in a trial of severe COVID-19 patients to shorten their hospital recovery time, has been at the forefront of the battle against the pandemic.

(Reuters) - Chinese electric vehicle (EV) manufacturer XPeng Inc said it hopes to raise up to $1.11 billion in its initial public offering (IPO) in New York, seeking to ride the enthusiasm for EVs even as U.S.-China relations remain strained.
The company said on Friday it intends to sell 85 million shares American depositary share (ADS), each representing two class A ordinary share, priced between $11 and $13 per share. 
At the top end of the range, XPeng's valuation stood at $9.17 billion. (https:// The IPO comes at a time when U.S.-listed Chinese companies are facing tightened scrutiny and strict audit requirements from U.S. regulators, as tensions escalate between two of the world's biggest economies. The Chinese EV maker said existing investors  Alibaba  Group (N:BABA), Coatue, and Qatar Investment Authority had indicated interest in buying up to $200 million, $100 million and $50 million, respectively, of the ADSs being offered.  Backer  Xiaomi  (OTC:XIACF) Corp (HK:1810) had also indicated interest in buying up to $50 million of the ADSs.  Alibaba will own all of XPeng's class C ordinary shares, representing 14.9% of the voting power of its total shares immediately after the completion of the offering, XPeng said.  XPeng's IPO comes after rival  Li Auto Inc  (O:LI), another Chinese electric vehicle startup, raised $1.09 billion in its IPO on Nasdaq last month. Share prices of EV makers including Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) and Nio Inc (N:NIO) have surged in recent months.  ""Investors can't seem to get enough exposure to electric vehicle stocks. We are comparing Xpeng with Li Auto, which went public in July and is up 28% from its IPO and to Nio,"" Kathleen Smith, Principal, Renaissance Capital, provider of institutional research and IPO ETFs, said.  Founded in 2014, Guangzhou-based XPeng delivered its first Xpeng G3 vehicle to customers in December 2018 and launched a second model in April this year. The company manufactures cars in two factories in China. 
BofA Securities, JP Morgan and  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) are among the underwriters for the IPO.

994,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 21, 2020 12:05PM ET</span>","Exclusive: Mexico tacks on request to Sempra unit's LNG export permit, say sources","By Dave Graham (NYSE:GHM)
MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico's government wants the local unit of  Sempra Energy  (NYSE:SRE) to build another export facility to help sell off excess natural gas in return for granting the energy infrastructure company a historic export permit, according to three people familiar with the matter.
San Diego-based Sempra has signaled that its Mexican unit IEnova is close to obtaining the export permit for the gas liquefaction facility at its regasification terminal Energia Costa Azul (ECA), near the northwestern port of Ensenada.
However, the government this month asked IEnova to commit to another facility in the port of Topolobampo in the Gulf of California to help Mexico unload excess gas capacity before issuing the export permit, two of the people said. 
The people spoke on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the ongoing discussions, which could still lead to a prompt authorization of the permit. Reuters was not immediately able to establish details of the proposed plant. 
The liquefied natural gas (LNG) export permit would be the first of its kind for a private company in Mexico.
One of Sempra's top pending projects, ECA could be a lucrative outlet for U.S. natural gas in Asia, with an initial export capacity of some 3 million tonnes per annum of LNG. 
Sempra's Chief Executive Jeffrey Martin was among the business leaders to attend a July meeting between Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador and his U.S. counterpart Donald Trump in Washington.
During the meeting, Sempra tweeted about the $1.9 billion it is investing in ECA, and brought the approval process to the presidents' attention, stirring hopes it would soon be resolved, according to several people familiar with the matter.
On Aug. 5, Martin told a conference call he was optimistic Sempra would get the export permit from the Mexican energy ministry during the third quarter.
IEnova referred questions on this article to Sempra, which owns a controlling 66.4% stake in the Mexican firm.
A Sempra spokeswoman said the company looked forward to seeing ECA progress and was still working with the Mexican government to obtain the export permit.
""Across all of the Sempra businesses, we constructively engage with our stakeholders to see how we can meet the needs of the communities in which we operate, and ... we are continuing to do that with respect to our LNG projects,"" she said.
Neither the Mexican energy ministry nor the president's office responded to requests for comment.
BUSINESS CONCERNS
IEnova had previously discussed with the government the possibility of installing such a plant in Topolobampo, according to two of the sources. But having to commit before getting the export permit was not part of its plan, they said.
The request may fuel concerns about ease of doing business under Lopez Obrador, who has strengthened state influence over energy policy and argues that corruption in past governments skewed the energy market in favor of private interests.
Still, he inherited dozens of privately-funded infrastructure projects from his predecessor, including a U.S.-connected gas pipeline due to terminate in Topolobampo.
Lopez Obrador recently brought up the ECA in public, without mentioning the government is linking approval of the export permit to another gas export plant in Topolobampo, where IEnova is already building a liquid fuels terminal.
The final stretch of the Topolobampo pipeline is incomplete due to resistance from a local indigenous community.
However, Lopez Obrador said on Aug. 10 it was important to complete it since Mexico had signed agreements under the last administration to import U.S. gas.
Topolobampo ""is where we can put a plant to handle gas and sell the (excess) gas to Asia,"" he told a news briefing.

The government was therefore exploring whether a deal could be reached with IEnova to ship that gas to Asia, he said.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Most of BOC Aviation's (BOCA) (HK:2588) airline clients have resumed rental payments, a sign of cautious optimism, after deferring payments when the pandemic struck this year, the Asian lessor's top executive told Reuters in an interview.
BOCA has completed repayment negotiations with the bulk of its customers, and airlines in markets such as China and the United States are recovering well after the industry was brought to a near stand-still by COVID-19, CEO Robert Martin said on Thursday.
""Already, we've been repaid a lot of the deferrrals that were put in place,"" he said after BOCA reported flat first-half net profit at $323 million, while total revenue and other income rose 11%.
""Experienced airlines clearly moved very quickly to react to the situation. The guys at the other end of the spectrum tended to be the entrepreneur-led airlines with big orders in emerging markets, and some of those have still got to come to the table,"" said Martin, an industry veteran of over 30 years.
Singapore-headquartered BOCA is one of the world's biggest lessors, with a fleet of 571 planes, including those on order. This year, it struck big deals with airlines to buy and lease back aircraft.
Airlines have deferred payments to lessors, which have shored up funding and delayed taking deliveries from Airbus (PA:AIR) and Boeing (N:BA), after expanding furiously in an industry boom over the past few decades.
BOCA took a $12 million asset impairment on five Boeing aircraft already delivered and repossessed three other planes.

""Things generally are getting better. I judge that from our internal cashflows but there are specific situations that will need to be worked out in the second half,"" he said, adding that BOCA had no unplaced new aircraft until 2023.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Three new U.S. stock exchanges are set to launch by the end of September, vying for market share against incumbents like the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq Inc (O:NDAQ), which have benefited from elevated trading volumes during the coronavirus pandemic.
Silicon Valley-based Long Term Stock Exchange (LTSE) goes live on Aug. 28, starting with two stocks and then ramping up to include all securities by Sept. 9. The Members Exchange (MEMX), which is backed by a who's who of Wall Street firms, begins a phased launch on Sept. 4, and MIAX Pearl Equities debuts on Sept. 25.
That will bring the total to 16 stock exchanges, with NYSE-owner Intercontinental Exchange Inc (N:ICE) operating five, Cboe Global Markets (Z:CBOE) running four, Nasdaq with three, and IEX Group one. 
The new bourses enter the market amid frothy trading volumes and a recent record high by the S&P 500 following a months-long rally in stocks after governments pumped trillions into the economy to counter the coronavirus' economic impact. 
The new competition also comes at a time of intense debate over fees between the large exchange operators and their customers.
MEMX will address those issues, Chief Executive Jonathan Kellner said in an interview. 
""On transaction fees, out of the gate, we are looking to be aggressive to attract order flow,"" he said.
MEMX's investors include big banks, like JPMorgan (N:JPM), Bank of America (N:BAC), Goldman Sachs (N:GS), as well as BlackRock Inc (N:BLK), the world's biggest money manager. Online brokers including  Charles Schwab  Corp (N:SCHW), Fidelity, and TD Ameritrade (O:AMTD), and market makers Citadel Securities and Virtu Financial (O:VIRT) are also backers. 
MIAX, which runs three options exchanges, has said it intends to start out 40% cheaper than the current lowest-cost operator.

LONDON/MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - One of the world's leading investor groups pushing for more corporate action on climate change said it has added Mexican state-owned oil company Petroleos Mexicanos (Pemex)[PEMX.UL] to its list of targets.
Climate Action 100+, whose 450 members manage more than $40 trillion in assets and focus on engaging with companies which produce high levels of greenhouse gas emissions, said it would now look to step up talks with Pemex.
""Pemex has been added to the list of firms engaged through Climate Action 100+ as part of a standard periodic review process,"" a spokesman for Climate Action 100+ told Reuters.
The decision to add Pemex, a top issuer of emerging market bonds, follows engagements with listed companies including Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) and BP (NYSE:BP), both of which have recently announced new long-term strategies in response to climate change.
Concerted pressure by the group has also helped bring about change at a number of other companies, among them Nestle, Maersk and HeidelbergCement (DE:HEIG), which have committed to net zero carbon emissions by 2050. 
The Pemex engagement will be led by asset managers Federated Hermes (NYSE:FHI) and BlueBay Asset Management, with other members of CA100+ currently being canvassed about formally joining the group.
""We expect more from Pemex,"" said Jaime Gornsztejn, who leads engagement with Latin American companies for Federated Hermes. The asset manager's stewardship team advises clients with more than $1 trillion in assets on corporate governance issues.
""It's such a crucial issue for any oil and gas company for the long term wealth creation,"" said Gornsztejn. ""That's why we expect strongly a shift on climate change by senior management and the board.""
Pemex did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Under Mexico's previous government, the company had laid out targets to reduce emissions, but under the new administration of President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador it has not reaffirmed those goals.
Climate Action 100+ was launched in late 2017 with the aim of engaging with companies to curb emissions and strengthen governance and climate-related financial disclosures. 

Earlier this year, the world's largest asset manager, BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), also joined the group.

The lender said in July it would launch a broad cost-cutting initiative this year as the bank braces for massive loan losses caused by the pandemic and continues to work through expensive regulatory and operational problems tied to a long-running sales scandal.
Layoffs, branch closures and cuts to third-party spending are on the table, the bank's executives had then said.
""We expect to reduce the size of our workforce through a combination of attrition, the elimination of open roles, and job displacements,"" a spokeswoman said in an email, adding that Wells Fargo was working to bring its expenses more in line with its peers and create a company that is more ""nimble"".
The bank will provide severance and career assistance to affected staff.
Big U.S. banks had postponed decisions about staff cuts when the virus outbreak first began to take hold, with executives saying they are unsure how long the outbreak would hurt the economy and worried about being unprepared if business suddenly snaps back.
Bloomberg News first reported the resumed job cuts on Friday.
Initial cuts will affect people the bank had planned to let go early this year before the pandemic halted layoffs, the Bloomberg report said, citing people briefed on the situation.

Bloomberg Law reported in July that Wells Fargo is preparing to cut thousands of jobs starting later this year.

Europe's biggest budget airline warned it would have to cut one in five of its pilots and cabin crew if they did not agree to pay cuts of up to 20% after the COVID-19 crisis grounded 99% of its planes from April to June and continued to hit business thereafter.

""We haven't finalised the number yet, we originally said there was going to be 3,000 redundancies but we have been able to reduce that significantly,"" Neal McMahon told Reuters in a telephone interview.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened mixed on Friday, paring premarket losses but unable to find the strength to advance further after a record-breaking week. 
By 9:35 AM ET (1335 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 12 points or less than 0.1% at 27,650 points. The S&P 500, which had set its first new record high since February earlier in the week and the Nasdaq Composite, which posted the latest of its 35 new record high closes this week, were both down by similar amounts. 
Such data as were published Friday were mildly supportive, with IHS Markit's PMIs for the manufacturing and services sectors both coming in ahead of expectations for August. Existing home sales data for August are due at 10 AM ET.
There was little to get excited about on a slow summer news day - with a few exceptions. Solid earnings from agricultural machinery maker Deere (NYSE:DE) & Co., often seen as a proxy for the health of the farming sector, sent the stock up 4.7% to a new all-time high. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock, meanwhile, cracked the $2,000 level for the first time ever ahead of its stock split. As with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s $2 trillion valuation posted earlier in the week, the number is of little significance beyond the fact that it's a nice round number.
Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock fell 0.5% after news that its consumer head Jeff Wilke is to retire.
The biggest immediate threat to stocks - from rising bond yields - has petered out in the second half of the week, with the yield on the 10-Year Treasury note falling to 0.64% from a high of 0.72% a week ago. However, the negative tone from other markets - Crude Oil Futures lost over 2% in early trading on worries about global demand - kept a cap on risk appetite.
The miserly yields on offer from bonds are one factor likely to support the stock market even if there is a new setback to the economy, argued Robeco portfolio manager Jeroen Blokland in a weekly blog post. 
""Valuation is a relative concept,"" Blokland said. ""Government bonds, for example, are currently a lot more expensive"" than equities.
He noted, however, that there is ""no shortage of catalysts"" on the horizon that could change market sentiment.
""The low-hanging fruit in the recovery has been harvested, labor markets remain weak and the run-up to U.S. elections may also lead to greater volatility on equity markets,"" Blokland argued. ""That's why we prefer to huddle fairly close to the exit; to ensure that when sentiment turns, and valuation is used as a stick to beat the dog, we are not trampled underfoot by other investors who are also all charging for the door at the same time.""

""RWE wants to ensure that the contract negotiated with the government can be signed immediately because first power plant closures are to take place at RWE as early as the end of the year, unlike at other operators,"" a company spokeswoman said.
Germany's lower house of parliament is expected to approve the relevant bill next month.
The bill pledges to pay out 50 billion euros ($59 billion) to help mining companies, power plant operators and affected regions cope with Germany's transition to more renewable energy. The country has committed to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 55% by 2030 from 1990 levels.
RWE is due to receive 2.6 billion euros for the phased closure of its brown coal mines and power stations.
Earlier, the Spiegel magazine's online edition reported RWE wanted to revisit the deal to start receiving the funds as Czech peer Leag continued to question the package. 
However, the spokeswoman said RWE was fully behind the deal. 
A spokesman for Leag, which is part of the EPH group, declined to comment on whether it was seeking changes to the coal exit bill.
While phasing out coal generation, RWE is expanding in renewable power where it became Europe's third-largest player after an asset swap deal with rival E.ON (DE:EONGn).

Pfizer has said repeatedly since June that it was targeting October for its application and the companies started a large late-stage study last month of the candidate vaccine, one of the few globally in later stages of development.
On Thursday they reported data from previous early-stage trials of the vaccine, BNT162b2, that showed it induced similar immune responses and had milder side effects than prior data on another candidate. 
Pfizer stock, down 1% this year, has trailed the stellar rises in value of major pharmaceutical companies this year.  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) and Britain's AstraZeneca (NYSE:AZN) are among those to have moved into late-stage trials. 
Raymond James European Strategist Chris Bailey said the Pfizer/BioNTech release had contributed to a more optimistic mood on stock markets on Friday.

Pfizer shares rose 1% while those of BioNTech were 6% higher before the bell.

1005,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 21, 2020 07:40AM ET</span>",Europe's travel recovery stalls in August: ticket data,"LONDON (Reuters) - Europe's travel recovery stalled at the start of August after a stronger performance in July, as quarantine rules and warnings over rising infection rates created uncertainty and deterred tourists from booking trips abroad.
In July, ticket numbers for cross-border air travel within Europe stood at 28% of 2019's levels, as Europeans began to travel again after months of lockdown. 
But by the first week of August, volumes had fallen to 18%, according to data provided by travel analysis group ForwardKeys. 
Britain brought back quarantine rules for arrivals from Spain on July 26, just over two weeks after saying travel there was safe, and so far in August has added France, Croatia and Austria to the list with less than two days notice.
Rising COVID-19 infection levels in Spain have also prompted Austria, Sweden and Germany to warn against travel to the whole country or regions within it, creating uncertainty, and dampening airline hopes for a strong recovery. 
Europe's biggest airline by passenger numbers, Ryanair (I:RYA), said on Monday it was already seeing the impact of new restrictions on bookings and it would reduce its flight capacity plans for September and October.
Looking ahead, tickets issued for the fourth quarter for intra-Europe air travel are down 70% on last year, said Olivier Ponti, vice president at ForwardKeys. 
The fast-changing situation also means people are leaving it much later to make plans, searching for flights and booking much closer to their intended departure date than they did last year, he said. 
Britain's transport minister Grant Shapps on Thursday warned on Twitter: ""Only travel if you are content to unexpectedly 14-day quarantine if required"".
With such warnings, airlines face an uphill battle to fill their planes and get people travelling again. 

""Consumer confidence has been shattered by waves and waves of cancellations, uncertainties regarding refunds, swift changes regarding travel restrictions from one day to the next, and that's something that is hampering recovery,"" Ponti said.

1006,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 21, 2020 07:27AM ET</span>",Canada Banks to Improve From Covid Quarter -- But It’s Still Bad,"(Bloomberg) -- Canada’s biggest banks are expected to see profits plunge for a second straight quarter due to economic fallout from the Covid-19 pandemic -- though there are signs of improvement.
The nation’s six-largest lenders will post an average profit decline of about 30% in the fiscal third quarter from a year earlier when they kick off the reporting season next week, according to the average estimates of seven analysts.
It’ll be one of the worst quarters in modern Canadian banking history, but it marks an improvement from the 50% profit drop in the second quarter when the virus first gripped the North American economy.
Earnings results for the three months ended July 31 will likely provide some calm after the “stormy” second quarter, Bank of Nova Scotia analyst Meny Grauman said in an Aug. 18 note. “While we expect performance to be better on a sequential basis, largely as a result of moderating loan loss provisions after a spike in the second quarter, results may still be down relative to the same quarter last year as the current pandemic-induced recession continues to take its toll.”
Royal Bank of Canada (NYSE:RY), Toronto Dominion Bank (TSX:TD) and four other large lenders built up C$10.9 billion ($8.3 billion) in reserves in the second quarter to brace for bad loans emerging from the coronavirus pandemic. Analysts see fewer loan-loss provisions in the third quarter for most banks, though they are still expected to remain elevated.
Stimulus Relief
Government relief efforts and loan deferrals by banks helped stave off an anticipated surge in delinquencies and impairments while keeping credit deterioration among consumers in check. Banks deferred mortgage payments for more than 760,000 Canadians as of the end of June, representing about 16% of mortgages held by the lenders, according to the Canadian Bankers Association.
“We believe recent extensions and amendments of government programs (combined with deferrals and a slightly better than expected economic recovery) will impact the timing and possibly magnitude of impairments, likely pushing the peak of impairments into mid-2021,” RBC Capital Markets analyst Darko Mihelic said in an Aug. 14 note.
Other Headwinds
Still, the pandemic has caused other headwinds. Covid-19 remains an “overhang” for banks, whose quarterly earnings will be tested with heightened provisions amid a languishing economic outlook, according to  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Plc analyst John Aiken.
“Margin pressures and moderating lending volumes will not provide relief on net interest income,” Aiken said in an Aug. 19 note. “However, market volatility could continue to spur trading activity, with expense control likely driving relative performance.”
Interest-rate cuts by central banks are expected to erode net interest margins -- the difference between what a bank charges for loans and pays for deposits -- and hurt profits.
“Net interest margins were a drag on earnings last quarter and we expect they will be an even bigger drag this quarter” given the timing of rate reductions from central banks, CIBC Capital Markets analyst Paul Holden said in an Aug. 18 note. “We expect margin compression to be more severe for those banks with large U.S. and international lending businesses and less severe for those with large domestic lending businesses.”
Those facing a bigger hit include Scotiabank, which has significant operations in Latin America, as well as Bank of Montreal (TSX:BMO) and Toronto-Dominion, which both have sizable U.S. retail banks. Royal Bank and National Bank of Canada (OTC:NTIOF) are expected to fare better, he said.
A surge in trading activity and more dealmaking may bode well for the capital-markets operations of the banks, while an equity markets rebound may lift assets and fees in wealth-management divisions. Even with those benefits, analysts aren’t expecting profit growth across the main operations of the banks.
There are some positives for the Big Six banks:
That’s why TD Securities analyst Mario Mendonca has an “overweight” rating for the Canadian banking sector, which he said in a note is “very much leveraged to our view that the banks will emerge from this crisis with their dividends, capital strength and earnings power intact.”

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are set to edge lower Friday, consolidating at the end of a record-breaking week with investors focusing on the race for the White House.
At 07:15 AM ET (1115 GMT), S&P 500 Futures traded 5 points, or 0.2%, higher, the Dow Futures contract fell 37 points, or 0.1%, while Nasdaq 100 Futures dropped 11 points, or 0.1%.
Earlier this week, the S&P 500 cash index broke above its late-February high and notched a fresh all-time high, while the Nasdaq Composite registered its 35th record close this year on Thursday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has underperformed and is lower so far this week.
U.S. stocks have been on an upward path since late March, when the Federal Reserve announced a slew of unprecedented economic support measures, buttressed by extraordinary levels of fiscal support in the form of unemployment spending and tax relief.
Sentiment has been kept in check this week, however, by mixed economic data and a warning from the Federal Reserve. Meanwhile, the political unity behind the first wave of stimulus measures has vanished, with Democrats and Republicans deadlocked on how much stimulus to extend over the rest of the year.
Initial weekly jobless claims came in above one million on Thursday, an uptick from the 971,000 claims reported last week, but continuing claims decreased by more than 600,000.
Also the Fed’s minutes from its July meeting showed the central bank’s staff lowering their estimate for economic growth over the second half of the year.
The key data release Friday will be existing home sales data, at 10 AM ET (1400 GMT), with sales having been strong in recent months.
That said, ranges may be tight with U.S. policymakers focusing on the upcoming presidential election to the detriment of an agreement on new virus relief measures.
On Thursday, Joe Biden accepted the Democratic Party's nomination for the November election, and President Donald Trump has his time in the sun next week when Republicans hold their virtual convention.
The earnings season is coming to an end, but there are still some numbers to keep an eye on. Deere & Company (NYSE:DE) reported strong fiscal third-quarter numbers, while  Foot Locker  (NYSE:FL) reported a comparable store sales increase of approximately 18% for the second quarter.
Oil prices weakened Friday, after an internal report from the major producing states flagged demand concerns for the market.
An internal report by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies, a group known as OPEC+, showed they expected oil demand in 2020 to fall by 9.1 million barrels per day, 100,000 bpd more than in its previous forecast, and by 11.2 million barrels if a Covid-19 second wave occurs globally in the second half of the year.
U.S. crude futures traded 1.3% lower at $42.27 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract fell 1.3% to $44.30.
Elsewhere, gold futures fell 0.5% to $1,936.55/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.6% lower at 1.1795."

The company plans to produce roughly 2,300 more cars and trucks than its initial plan for around 230,000, Reuters calculations found. 
Vehicle production at the world's No.2 automaker is recovering at home and abroad since global output fell by more than half year-on-year in April and May, when plants were shuttered to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus. 
Toyota declined to comment on global production plans for next month, but the company has said it expects global sales will be 15% lower in the July-September quarter from last year, and 5% lower in October-December. By early 2021, sales will be 5% higher on the year. 

Toyota plans to sell 7.2 million vehicles in the year to March, down 20% from a year ago.

In contrast, they remain among the most popular picks for hedge funds, according to an analysis by  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS).
Many mutual funds have limits on how much of their assets can be in a single stock to ensure diversification. As a result, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL).,  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT). and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN). are the three most-underweight stocks in large-cap funds, according to Goldman strategists including Ben Snider, David Kostin and Arjun Menon. But those same companies are on the firm’s Hedge Fund VIP list of most-popular names, according to a separate report with a team that also included those three strategists.
“Apple, Microsoft and Amazon –- which each account for 5%+ of the Russell 1000 Growth and S&P 500 indices -– are the most underweight stocks across large-cap mutual funds,” Goldman said in one of the reports released Aug. 20. “Unfortunately for the typical fund manager, these stocks have returned 59%, 34%, and 76% year-to-date, respectively. Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) also entered the most underweight basket this quarter.”
Goldman broadly categorized the second quarter as positive for both hedge funds and mutual funds.
The strategists said hedge funds were rewarded for a continued commitment to their favorite growth stocks. The mutual-funds report said those vehicles benefited from strong performances by their most overweight stock positions since the March trough, and said that 40% of large-cap funds beat their benchmarks, compared with a 10-year average of 31%.
It isn’t just megacap holdings where hedge funds and mutual funds diverge. Mutual-fund overweights to value and cyclical sectors like financials are the highest on record, Goldman said. The hedge-fund long portfolio tilt away from value is extreme historically, and financials remain a large underweight, it said.
“As equity prices and economic data rebounded in 2Q, funds moved only slightly toward cyclicals,” Goldman said in the hedge-fund report. “The hedge fund long portfolio tilt away from value stocks is nonetheless the largest in our 18-year data history.”"
1011,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 21, 2020 06:20AM ET</span>","Fearing shipping crunch, retailers set earliest-ever holiday sale plans","By Melissa Fares and Lisa Baertlein
NEW YORK/LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - The coronavirus pandemic is upending the way U.S. consumers shop and the holidays will be no exception as major retailers and shippers roll out their earliest-ever shopping season.
 Target  (N:TGT),  Best Buy  (N:BBY) and Kohl's (N:KSS) have moved winter holiday promotions up to as early as October. They also joined rival Walmart (N:WMT) in announcing store closures on Thanksgiving and plans to bypass the midnight Black Friday door-buster sales that traditionally mark the start of the holiday season but are incompatible with the pandemic's social distancing recommendations.
Kohl's Chief Executive Michelle Gass said on Tuesday that ""a holiday season like no other"" means emphasizing comfortable apparel, home essentials and kids' toys, all categories that have performed well as shoppers largely opt to remain at home.
Target CEO Brian Cornell on Wednesday said the retailer will stress same-day delivery and add thousands of items available via these services, including more gifts and essentials during the ""very different holiday season."" Same-day delivery takes strain off delivery firms like  United Parcel  Service (N:UPS) and FedEx (N:FDX) because it's done by ""gig"" drivers for companies like Shipt, DoorDash and Postmates.
One supplier to a big box retailer told Reuters that the chain is bracing for a 30% decline in holiday spending this year, though the National Retail Federation (NRF) trade group has yet to release its holiday forecast.
""It'll be interesting to see if stores even have Black Friday sales or are open on Black Friday,"" said Randy Hare, portfolio manager at Huntington Private Bank, who says he is ""starting to think about how we want to be positioned into the holiday season.""
Some logistics firms are urging retail clients to pace promotions - for example, pushing big-screen TVs one week and holiday sweaters the next - to ease the crush. 
""It can't be a blitz of every single you product you have online. Let's pick and choose,"" said Scott Sureddin, DHL Supply Chain CEO for North America. 
Ecommerce is expected to reach a record 15% of all U.S. sales this year, according to research firm eMarketer, and retailers are scouring their operations for opportunities to wring out costs. They aren't getting any breaks from delivery companies, which are slapping hefty surcharges on holiday packages and cherry-picking business by limiting shipments on some customers.
Logjams at the U.S. Postal Service - which according to Rakuten Intelligence now handles almost 40% of last-mile home deliveries - are taxing the U.S. shipping network, which is bracing for a holiday volume spike on top of pandemic-fueled demand that shippers characterized as a ""second Christmas."" 
Average daily package volume at UPS hit 24.4 million during the second quarter, almost 92% what it was during the fourth-quarter holiday peak.
Demand is so robust that the USPS announced its first-ever holiday surcharge - joining UPS and FedEx.
""We know that online shopping picks up over the holidays and the system is already pressed to meet that sort of demand,"" said Mark Mathews, vice president of research at the NRF. ""If you've got a situation where you're adding another 10 or 20% to that, which is well within the realm of a possibility, that creates real challenges.""
Retailers are struggling to keep their shelves stocked for any holiday purchases while avoiding getting stuck with too much unsold merchandise if anxious shoppers decline to open their wallets. The NRF recently forecast a 9.4% decline in total container imports this year.
By starting promotions early - in some cases before Halloween - retailers risk giving shoppers holiday fatigue. But analysts and investors say the idea could help draw shoppers back. Footfall in retail centers remained just a quarter of last year's levels, data gathered by analytics firm Springboard showed, increasing by a mere 5% since early June.
The July 31 expiration of a $600 weekly unemployment benefit, which pumped $18 billion per week into the economy, is expected to jolt consumer sentiment and spending in coming months. 
This week, Walmart, Kohl's and Target all reported that the back-to-school season - the second most important for retailers - has been ""choppy,"" ""slow"" and ""uncertain,"" as rampant U.S. COVID-19 infections threw school reopenings into doubt and shoppers had little-to-no need for backpacks and uniforms.

On Wednesday, Target, which clocked its best quarterly comparable sales growth and online revenue that nearly tripled, announced it would extend back-to-school deals and offerings.

1012,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 21, 2020 05:54AM ET</span>",StockBeat: Galapagos' Halo Slips,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- Onno van de Stolpe named his biotech startup after a chain of islands famed for the diversity and inventiveness of its wildlife. It’s ironic, then, that the market is treating it very much as a fragile one-trick pony.
 Galapagos  (AS:GLPG) (NASDAQ:GLPG) stock has fallen nearly 30% this week since the U.S. Federal Drug Administration refused to approve its rheumatoid arthritis drug filgotinib. The Nasdaq-listed ADRs (NASDAQ:GLPG) have fallen in parallel. After a brief respite on Thursday, it fell another 4.4% by mid-morning in Europe on Friday and is now testing its lowest levels in over a year. The local benchmark AEX index rose 0.4%. 
The FDA sent Galapagos and its partner, Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ:GILD), a “complete response letter” detailing concerns both about the side effects of filgotinib – notably its apparent depression of sperm count – and about the general effectiveness of the 200mg dose used by the developers in their clinical tests. Laymen may be surprised that the issue of fathering children was so important to the FDA, given that 50% of patients will be women and most of the rest more concerned about being able to hold a cup of tea than father another child, but then, what do laymen know?
While the CRL isn’t a final rejection of the drug, it does raise the real risk of rejection in the U.S.  Even if Galapagos and Gilead can satisfy the FDA’s concerns when they resubmit the paperwork, they will have lost valuable time.
That may lead to them forfeiting market share to rivals in a global market estimated at $26 billion a year.  Given that it hopes to deploy filgotinib against a range of related ailments, the loss of upside potential is considerably bigger: Galapagos estimates the overall market for anti-inflammation drugs at $64 billion a year.
But not all is lost: the European Medicines Agency’s scientists have already recommended the drug for approval by the European Commission, which is due to give its decision within the next six weeks. A decision from Japanese authorities is also due by the end of the year.
In the meantime, the stock is suffering the kind of reality check that happens when a loss-making startup with a high valuation admits that it will take longer to live up to its hype. Galapagos was supposed to get $100 million in milestone payments when the FDA approved filgotinib. After Wednesday, it’s had to revise up its estimated cash burn accordingly to between 490 and 520 million euros.
That shouldn’t be any real cause for alarm. Having sold a 25% stake to Gilead last year, the company was sitting on over 5.5 billion in net cash at the end of June. Strip that out of today’s market value and you get a valuation of 2 billion euros for a pipeline of over 40 experimental drugs, most of them  still far from commercialization.
Such a profile requires a lot of trust in management’s ability to execute and avoid the kind of late-stage surprises seen this week.
The stock today is roughly back where it was when Gilead made its bet. Given this week’s knock-back, investors could reasonably demand a bigger discount before making the same one now."

Unite, the trade union, first threatened BA with strike action in July. After a union meeting on Thursday, a spokesman said that he would instruct lawyers to proceed to industrial action.
But any strike action, which would need to be approved by a vote, is likely to be some weeks away given that Unite has yet to formally start the process. 
BA on Friday said that it had ""received no notification of any ballot for industrial action"", the first step in a weeks-long process which precedes any strike. 
British Airways, owned by IAG (L:ICAG), says it is battling to survive after the pandemic wiped out international travel. It has been burning through 20 million pounds a day and has said it needs to axe up to 12,000 jobs.
While flying restarted in Europe in June, new restrictions continue to be imposed. On Thursday, Britain brought in quarantine rules for Austria and Croatia, creating a new problem for travel demand in markets served by BA.
Unite says that the cuts BA is trying to make go too far. It argues that staff who keep their jobs at the airline face contracts which provide no stability or security, and involve pay cuts of up to 43%.

""Enough is enough. We will now instruct our legal specialists to proceed to industrial and legal action, which will hit BA in the autumn,"" Unite said in a statement.

LONDON (Reuters) - Global stock markets enjoyed cautious gains on Friday, taking their cue from Wall Street tech shares, but tepid economic data and lofty valuations reined in the advances in the wake of huge rally that has wiped out coronavirus losses.
Global stocks advanced 0.2% while the pan-European STOXX 600 climbed 0.4% after healthy gains in Asian-Pacific bourses in the wake of U.S. tech shares closing higher on Thursday, shrugging off some sombre unemployment data in the world's top economy.
European stock markets also looked beyond fresh numbers painting a muted economic outlook with purchasing managers' index releases from France and Germany as well as the wider euro zone falling short of expectations, flagging a slowing momentum in the recovery.
""European stocks shrug off faltering flash PMIs,"" said Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets.
""The latest flash PMI data for August in France and Germany would appear to point to a plateauing in economic activity, particularly in the services sector, where rising infection rates here could well be tempering economic activity on the margins.""
A stronger pound weighed on UK's export-heavy FTSE 100. 
Meanwhile U.S. futures pointed to a flat open. 
The S&P 500 has rallied 54% from its March low in a world awash with monetary and fiscal stimulus, but money managers are questioning the future trajectory. 
""We think equity markets, certain credit markets, and the U.S. dollar have yet to fully reflect the long-term impact of ultra-loose Fed policy,"" said Mark Haefele, Chief Investment Officer at UBS Global Wealth Management 
Overnight, clouds returned to the U.S. labour market outlook, with weekly jobless claims back over a million to put the total number of Americans on unemployment benefits at 28 million.
The Philadelphia Federal Reserve's business index also missed expectations and together the weak readings pushed down nominal U.S. yields and dragged on the dollar. Benchmark U.S. 10-year debt yields were last steady at 0.6461%.
DOLLAR BLUES
In currency markets, the euro inched higher to sit at $1.1838 with the dollar weighed down by concerns over the strength of a U.S. economic recovery in the wake of the jobs data. 
A bounce in the greenback after Federal Reserve minutes that fell short of dovish market expectations wore off fairly quickly and the dollar looked set for a ninth consecutive weekly loss against a basket of currencies. [FRX/] 
The Japanese yen inched up to 105.59 after an inflation miss supported real yields while China's yuan surged to a seven-month high as traders bet on Chinese growth.
Meanwhile sterling sat flat against the dollar to sit at $1.3222.
In commodity markets, the prospect of production cuts had oil prices on track for a small third straight weekly gain. On the day, Brent crude futures slipped a slither to $44.84 a barrel and U.S. crude future to $42.73 a barrel.

Gold was a touch softer at $1,936.7 an ounce.

Investing.com - European stock markets traded mixed Friday, with positive news from the dominant German manufacturing sector data helping while the U.K. market underperformed amid concerns about the cost of the government's pandemic relief policies.
At 3:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.4% higher, the CAC 40 in France rose 0.3% and the U.K.'s FTSE index was down 0.1%.
The important German manufacturing sector proved its resilience in August, with IHS Markit's flash PMI estimate rising to 53.0 from 51.0, reaching its highest level in nearly two years.
Overall, the news wasn’t very impressive, with the service sector dragging the overall composite German index to 53.7 from 55.3 in July. This was still above the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction, but was the first drop after three months of gains.
French business activity also disappointed in August, with IHS Markit saying its preliminary composite purchasing managers index fell to 51.7 points from 57.3 in July.
Earlier Friday, U.K. retail sales rose more than expected, surged past their pre-coronavirus level in July, showing the strength of consumer demand even as the economy as a whole struggles to recover from the Covid-19-inspired hit.
That said, the extent to which the U.K. government has had to support the wider economy was vividly illustrated Friday, as Britain's public debt went above 2 trillion pounds ($2.65 trillion) for the first time in July.
In corporate news, Kingspan (LON:KSP) stock rose 7.4% as the Ireland-based builder said it was well placed to come through the coronavirus crisis in a strong position, seeing significant pent up demand post-lockdown.
Swiss drugmaker  Novartis  (SIX:NOVN) climbed 1.2% after it won U.S. health regulator's approval to repurpose an 11-year-old blood cancer drug against multiple sclerosis.  
Oil prices weakened Friday, after an internal report from the major producing states flagged demand concerns as they tried to limit supply to market.
An internal report by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies indicated that some members of the group, known as OPEC+, would need to slash output by 2.31 million barrels per day to make up for producing more that they had committed to, Reuters reported.
That said, the report also flagged demand risks, showing OPEC+ expects oil demand in 2020 to fall by 9.1 million barrels per day, 100,000 bpd more than in its previous forecast, and by 11.2 million barrels if a Covid-19 second wave occurs globally in the second half of the year.
U.S. crude futures traded 0.5% lower at $42.62 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract fell 0.4% to $44.71.

1021,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 21, 2020 02:27AM ET</span>",Europe Battles Virus Spike With No Appetite for New Lockdowns,"(Bloomberg) -- Europe is facing a resurgence of coronavirus infections with little willingness to resort to the stringent restrictions on movement that helped the region control the pandemic after an initial surge in March and April.
Economies were decimated by the crisis in the second quarter, and governments are desperate to foster a swift recovery. German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Thursday urged European leaders to work together to avoid reviving lockdowns, calling instead for unified action.
“Politically, we want to avoid closing borders again at any cost, but that assumes that we act in coordination,” Merkel said during a visit with Emmanuel Macron at the French president’s summer residence on the Mediterranean coast.
The uptick in cases in recent weeks has been blamed on social gatherings and travelers. Containment measures focus on targeted initiatives, such as clamping down on nightclubs, requiring masks in public areas and mandating people returning from hard-hit regions quarantine or prove they’re not carrying the disease. So far the measures have yet to show much of an effect.
Here’s the situation in continental Europe’s major economies:
Germany
German infections increased by more than 1,000 for a fourth straight day on Friday, rising by 1,586. While that’s still well below the peak of nearly 7,000 in the spring, Merkel this week ruled out any steps to ease restrictions until the outbreak is under control.
The government will need to impose fines on people flaunting hygiene and social-distancing rules, Merkel said.
Germany is requiring people returning from hard-hit areas to quarantine for two weeks or present a negative test to prevent the disease from spreading in schools and workplaces.
The country’s Robert Koch Institute, which has repeatedly called the recent trend “very concerning,” has declared a number of regions in Europe -- including most of Spain -- as risk areas. On Thursday, it added two coastal regions in Croatia and part of Romania to the list, while Luxembourg and three other Romanian regions were no longer seen as risky.
Germany started easing curbs on April 20, when shops were allowed to start resuming business. Students are returning to schools, but with distancing and hygiene measures in place.
France
France recorded 4,771 new cases on Thursday, a level not reached since mid-April. Masks must now be worn in busy outdoor areas of Paris and Marseilles. Nice has implemented general mask-wearing since Thursday morning, and Toulouse is to follow suit on Friday, the largest cities to do so.
Macron has ruled out another nationwide lockdown, saying the country’s response must be to “speed up vaccines, guarantee their access, and provide the best health response given what we know,” he told Paris Match magazine.
Testing, tracing, isolating the infected and broadening the wearing of masks when necessary are also key, while targeted local lockdowns could be implemented if need be, he said.
France started to gradually ease its lockdown from May 11, and re-opened tourist attractions -- such as the Versailles palace and the Louvre Museum -- over the summer under strict hygiene conditions.
Due to the resurgence of cases, some resorts have closed their beaches at night, with nightclubs still shut for the foreseeable future and a ban on gatherings of more than 5,000 people was extended until end October.
Italy
Italy has also seen a pickup in new cases, albeit more contained than elsewhere. On Thursday, the country reported 845 new infections, the biggest increase since May 16.
The government has closed nightclubs, banned dancing in public venues and made face masks compulsory from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. in all places, including streets and squares, where crowds can gather.
Recent outbreaks have been traced back to parties in seaside resorts such as Porto Rotondo in Sardinia, as well as to people returning from vacations abroad. The government could move to isolate Sardinia, one of the country’s busiest summer vacation regions, Corriere della Sera reported Thursday, citing unnamed ministry officials.
After almost two months, Italy began emerging from lockdown on May 4, when about 4 million people went back to work.
Spain
Spain has re-emerged as the epicenter of the pandemic on the continent. The country reported 3,349 new infections on Thursday, compared with 3,715 a day earlier, which was the most since April 23.
The nation has appeared rudderless during the recent upsurge. Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez -- whose handling of the pandemic has been widely panned -- is on vacation with his family and hasn’t addressed the public even as bad news piles up.
Spain’s tourism industry is reeling, and the economy is on its knees. Some voters are on edge and any perceived political indifference could hurt the weak minority government that relies on separatists to stay in power.
Spain ended its state of emergency on June 21, entering a phase that the government has called a “new normal.” But one country after another has issued travel warnings, dealing a fresh blow to Spanish tourism.

Investing.com - European stock markets are set to open in a mixed fashion Friday, helped by more gains on Wall Street overnight but with investors wary about the state of the global economic recovery ahead of the release of key purchasing managers economic indicators.
At 2:10 AM ET (0610 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.1% higher, the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. fell 0.1%, while CAC 40 futures in France rose 0.1%.
U.S. stocks closed higher on Wall Street Thursday, boosted by gains in giant technology companies despite renewed concerns that a recovery from the pandemic-induced recession will take a prolonged period.
This follows news that applications for U.S. unemployment benefits unexpectedly increased, while the Philadelphia Fed reported a disappointing reading for its manufacturing index.
Additionally, “the minutes of the European Central Bank's July meeting [released Thursday] can be summarised with one word: ‘uncertainty’,” said analyst Carsten Brzeski at ING, in a research note. 
“Uncertainty about the economic outlook and the pandemic is keeping the central bank on high alert.”
With this in mind, investors will likely carefully study the release of the European Purchasing Managers' Indexes, later Friday, for clues as to the health of the region’s economy. Eurozone business activity returned to modest growth in July, but forecasts suggest this growth may have stagnated in August as some areas experienced the reemergence of the coronavirus.
U.K. retail sales showed a sharp reduction in growth in July, climbing 3.6% compared with a jump of 13.9% in June, but this was still better than the 2% widely expected.  
Oil prices edged higher Friday, helped by efforts by the major producing states to curtail supply to the market amid concerns about the recovery of demand.

SEOUL/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - South Korean retail investors are stampeding into Chinese stocks in record numbers, ploughing hundreds of millions of dollars into a tech sector rush far removed from punishing taxes and regulations on investment at home.
In July alone, South Korean investors spent $240 million buying shares in mainland China, data from the Korea Securities Depository (KSD) showed - their largest investment in mainland markets on record.
That's a seven-fold jump from $32.9 million in July last year, and accounts for a third of the total $719 million net investment in China stocks for the January-July period.
While South Korean mom and pop investors have historically been big risk-takers, they have stepped up the hunt for assets overseas as the Korean government imposes stringent mortgage rules and proposals to impose capital gains tax on local stocks.
Among them is the Kim, a 40-year-old Seoul chef with more invested than 500 million won - nearly half a million dollars - in Chinese stocks. Like others, Kim, who declined to given his forename, is betting on Beijing's push for tech self-sufficiency to counter U.S. trade sanctions and bans.
""It is true that interest in Chinese stocks has increased more than ever, driven by tightened regulations on domestic stocks and a boom in the China market unseen since 2015,"" said Kim.
The United States remains a top destination for investors like Kim, with Korean investments there a net $2.27 billion in July, followed by $475 million in Hong Kong, out of a total $3.19 billion of overseas stock buying.
But they are also being lured by the promise of China' speedy economy recovery from the coronavirus pandemic and its rising stock market - China's tech-heavy start-up board ChiNext and its STAR Market are up about 40% each this year.
Overseas stocks make up about 80% of Kim's equity holdings, with 90% of that chunk allotted to China and the rest to U.S. equities. Kim plans to park all his equity investments overseas, and is particularly bullish on the Chinese economy and mainland companies with high growth potential.

KSD data showed six of the 10 top Chinese companies that Korean investors bought between January and July were tech companies, with Shennan Circuits Co Ltd, a supplier to giant tech firm Huawei supplier, taking the lead with $55.36 million net.
ZTE Corp (HK:0763) was also high on Korean investment list, along with Inspur Electronic Information Technology Co Ltd, Will Semiconductor Co Ltd and Luxshare Precision Industry.
The average year-to-date performance of those six shares shows a spurt of 32%, compared with declines of 0.7% and 23.7% respectively for Korean tech heavyweights Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) Co Ltd and SK Hynix Inc.
What's more, the broader Shanghai Composite index is up 10.3%, while Seoul's KOSPI benchmark has gained only 3.8%.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Distressed investment firm Marble Ridge Capital LP plans to wind down its funds after a government report called into question the actions of its managing partner, Dan Kamensky, during the Neiman Marcus Group bankruptcy, the firm said on Thursday.
""After much consideration, and in light of the operating environment, we have made the difficult decision to commence an orderly wind-down of the Marble Ridge funds,"" the firm told clients in a letter seen by Reuters. 
""Marble Ridge will manage the liquidation in the best interests of our investors and with the objective of protecting and enhancing the value of the funds' assets.""
Robert Siegfried, an external spokesman for Marble Ridge, declined to comment.
Reuters and other media reported on Thursday that Kamensky admitted a ""grave mistake"" to the Department of Justice's U.S. Trustee division, which oversees bankruptcies, in interfering with a potential bid for certain assets of the luxury retailer. 
His actions, described as pressuring a Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) employee not to bid on certain Neiman assets, were publicly disclosed in a report from Henry Hobbs, acting U.S. trustee for the western and southern districts of Texas, ahead of a scheduled hearing for a judge to consider Neiman’s reorganization plan.

Marble Ridge, based in New York and founded in 2015 by Kamensky, a former partner at hedge fund firm Paulson & Co, had $1.2 billion in assets under management as of December 31, a regulatory filing showed. 
A Marble Ridge investor told Reuters late Thursday that the firm shutting its hedge funds was the ""right and inevitable result"" of the events.

Investing.com – Asian stocks were up on Friday morning, ending the week on a high on the back of a strong session overall for U.S. markets on Thursday and despite investor concerns over the U.S. economic recovery.
Stocks fell during the previous session after data released by the U.S. on Thursday showed that the number of initial jobless claims topped one million during the past week. The number of claims missed forecasts of 925,000 claims prepared by Investing.com, and saw an uptick from the 971,000 claims reported last Thursday.
But some investors remained cautiously optimistic, with improvements in the labor market forecasted to be sporadic and indicative of a pause in recovery, rather than a notable change in direction.
“We are looking for a continued improvement in the economy, but the pace will probably slow down now that we’ve had this quick rebound. That puts a lid on the upper end of yields,”  Charles Schwab  (NYSE:SCHW) chief fixed income strategist Kathy Jones told Bloomberg.

LOS ANGELES/NEW YORK (Reuters) - A California appeals court ruling on Thursday avoided a shutdown of ride-hailing services Uber and  Lyft  in the state, effectively handing a decision over gig worker benefits and pay to voters in a November ballot measure.
The last-minute ruling, in a case with potential ripple effects across the global gig economy, means drivers can continue working as independent contractors while the appeals court considers the question of driver status.
The companies had threatened an imminent shutdown as early as midnight across California. They said they would be unable to comply with the state's new law, which considers their drivers employees and not contractors, entitled to benefits such as minimum wage, overtime, sick pay and unemployment insurance.
The court, which has scheduled arguments in the case for Oct. 13, is unlikely to issue a final ruling before a Nov. 3 ballot measure puts the decision in the hands of California voters.
""It's unfortunate that the companies continue to not follow the law,"" said Mekela Edwards, an Uber driver from Oakland who said he was campaigning against the ballot measure.
Uber and Lyft drivers, some supporting the ballot measure and others opposing it, staged a noisy rally outside Los Angeles International Airport on Thursday, ahead of the appeals court decision.
""If people want to be employed, they can look for a different job,"" said Ramon, a driver supporting the measure known as Proposition 22 who declined to give his full name.
Lyft, Uber, DoorDash, Instacart and Postmates are spending more than $110 million to support the ballot measure. It would enshrine drivers' current contractor status, albeit with some added benefits, and overwrite the state's gig worker law.
Lyft Inc (NASDAQ:LYFT) shares were up 5.7% after the ruling, and Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc shares were up 6.7%.
The threat to suspend service in the most populous U.S. state marked an unprecedented escalation in a long-running fight between regulators, labor groups and gig economy companies that have upended traditional employment models around the world.
Uber and Lyft both welcomed the court's emergency stay order in separate statements, saying they were pleased to be able to continue their California operations.
An Aug. 9 poll among Californians by Refield & Wilton showed 41% of voters planned to support the companies' proposal and 26% oppose it, with the remainder still undecided. 
Despite Thursday's reprieve, the office of California Attorney General Xavier Becerra said it remained confident in its case and would continue its fight to defend the rights of workers.
""California is America’s economic engine because innovation and worker rights go hand in hand. Any company that suggests otherwise is peddling a false choice,"" Becerra said.
The companies had sought the intervention of the California First District Court of Appeal in San Francisco to block an injunction order issued by a judge last week. That ruling forced the companies to treat their drivers as employees starting Thursday after midnight. 
Uber and Lyft say the vast majority of their drivers do not want to be employees, with some 80% working less than 20 hours per week. The companies say their flexible on-demand business model is not compatible with traditional employment law and advocate for what they call a ""third way"" between employment and contractor status.
Under the ""third way"" proposal outlined in the ballot measure, drivers would receive a health care stipend, a minimum wage, expense reimbursements as well as medical and disability coverage for injuries on the job. 
Labor groups reject the companies' claims that current employment laws are not compatible with flexible work schedules and argue the companies should play by the same rules as other businesses. They say the companies' ballot measure would create a new underclass of workers with fewer rights and protections.
The regulatory and legal fight comes at a time when demand for rides has plummeted amid the coronavirus pandemic, with California among the U.S. states with the slowest recovery, according to the companies. Uber's revenue-generating food delivery business Eats is not impacted by the shutdown, the company has said.

California represents 9% of Uber's global rides and Eats gross bookings, but a negligible amount of adjusted earnings, Uber said in November. Lyft, which only operates in the U.S. and does not have a food delivery business, last week said California makes up some 16% of total rides.

(Reuters) - Shares of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc surged past the $2,000 mark on Thursday for the first time as the electric car maker extended its recent rally ahead of an upcoming share split.
The company's stock closed at a record high $2,001.83, up 6.6% for the day. 
With many investors betting Tesla will be added to the S&P 500 after a strong quarterly report last month, the stock has surged over 300% in 2020. 
GRAPHIC: Tesla's relentless advance - https://graphics.reuters.com/TESLA-STOCKS/oakpeozrgpr/chart.png
The stock has jumped 45% just since Aug. 11, when Tesla announced a five-for-one stock split, with shareholders of record on Aug. 21 receiving four additional shares for each share they own, distributed after the close of trading on Aug. 28. 
Thursday's surge put Tesla's stock market value at $372 billion, greater than all but seven of the S&P 500's components.
Tesla's stock is among the highest priced, per share, on Wall Street, and the Palo Alto, California-based company has said it was looking to make its shares more accessible to employees and investors. 
However, with Robinhood and other brokerages increasingly letting customers by fractions of individual shares, the benefit of stock splits has become less obvious, making Tesla's rally following the announcement of its stock split surprising to some professional investors.
Tesla's stock is currently priced at an exceedingly high 148 times expected earnings, according to Refinitiv, and that valuation will not be affected by the upcoming stock split. 
Tesla will start rolling out ""made-in-China"" Model Y vehicles at its factory in Shanghai starting in 2021, the Global Times tweeted on Thursday, citing an unnamed executive. 
Investors expect important announcements when Tesla holds its long-awaited Battery Day on Sept. 22, the same day as its annual shareholder meeting. 

The company is expected to present battery innovations, with analysts at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) predicting a company announcement on supplying “superior” battery packs to the auto industry.

1028,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 20, 2020 06:26PM ET</span>","Facing Trump criticism, Goodyear says employees can wear clothes supporting police","By David Shepardson and Andrea Shalal
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -  Goodyear Tire  (O:GT) Chief Executive Rich Kramer said on Thursday the company had clarified its policy to make clear employees can wear apparel expressing support for law enforcement after it faced a boycott call from U.S. President Donald Trump.
The Republican president, who is seeking a second term in office, told reporters on Wednesday he would swap out the Goodyear tires on his presidential limousine if there were an alternative.
Goodyear on Thursday said it had a longstanding policy of asking employees of refraining from working place expressions of support for any political candidates.
Trump accused the Ohio-based company of ""playing politics"" by forbidding workers from donning the ""Make America Great Again"" caps favored by his supporters.
""Don't buy GOODYEAR TIRES - They announced a BAN ON MAGA HATS,"" he wrote on Twitter Wednesday, referring to his slogan ""Make America Great Again"" often emblazoned on baseball caps.
Trump said it was ""disgraceful"" that the company would prevent employees from wearing attire supporting the 'Blue Lives Matter' movement that supports law enforcement, while allowing support for other causes.
Goodyear said a widely circulated image created by a plant employee that triggered the controversy was not created or distributed by the company's corporate group.
The image spelled out appropriate and inappropriate displays, with 'Black Lives Matter' and 'Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender Pride' deemed acceptable, while 'Blue Lives Matter' and 'MAGA Attire' were not.
Kramer said Goodyear ""strongly supports"" law enforcement noting it has supplied tires to police and fire vehicles for more than 100 years. ""That relationship is foundational to our company,"" Kramer wrote employees Thursday. ""Goodyear has always supported both law enforcement and equal justice.""
Shares in Goodyear fell as much as 6% on Wednesday after Trump's tweet, but pared some losses to close down 2.4%. Goodyear shares fell 0.4% Thursday to $9.46.

The White House did not comment on Goodyear's new statement, but White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow earlier defended the boycott call, saying Goodyear should change its workplace policy to allow political speech.

""We are committed to cooperating with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission's inquiry and answering the questions the agency may have,"" the social media company said in a statement.
The FTC declined to comment.
Politico reported the interview earlier on Thursday.
The FTC told Facebook in June 2019 it was probing whether the company has engaged in unlawful monopolistic practices.
Facebook faces similar probes by the Justice Department and by state attorneys general and has said the investigations are looking at prior acquisitions and business practices involving ""social networking or social media services, digital advertising, and/or mobile or online applications.""
Politico said Zuckerberg's testimony was conducted under oath over two days this week remotely. Staff from states investigating Facebook were also involved, Politico reported.
In July 2019, Facebook agreed to pay a record-breaking $5 billion fine to resolve a separate FTC probe into the company's privacy practices.
The FTC probe that resulted in the $5 billion settlement uncovered a wide range of privacy issues.
The FTC came under criticism in the privacy probe for not requiring Zuckerberg to answer questions under oath. FTC Chairman Joe Simons said in 2019 it was unnecessary to depose Zuckerberg.
Also in July 2019, the U.S. Justice Department said it was opening a broad investigation of major digital technology firms into whether they engage in anticompetitive practices.

Last week, Deputy Attorney General Jeff Rosen told Reuters the tech investigation was going ""full tilt."" He declined to specify when the government would decide whether to bring an antitrust action against Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google.

Investing.com - Ross Stores (NASDAQ:ROST) reported on Thursday second-quarter results that topped expectations, though the company struck a cautious tone on its outlook, citing significant coronavirus-led uncertainty on consumer demand.
Shares rose 0.85% in late trading.
Ross Stores announced earnings per share of $-0.13 on revenue of $2.68 billion. Analysts polled by Investing.com anticipated EPS of $-0.28 on revenue of $2.46 billion.
The company's stores were open on average for 75% of the quarter amid disruptions owing to the pandemic.
""During the initial re-openings, sales were ahead of our conservative plans as we benefited from pent-up demand and aggressive markdowns to clear aged inventory. In the weeks thereafter, trends were negatively impacted from depleted store inventory levels while we were ramping up our buying and distribution capabilities,"" said Ross Chief Executive Officer Barbara Rentler.
Looking ahead to the third quarter, the company said, ""Trends have not materially changed from the second quarter with comparable store sales for the first two and a half weeks trending down mid-teens versus last year. There remains significant uncertainty on how the pandemic will continue to evolve and affect consumer demand and the economy, and the potential exists for additional government mandated shutdowns if COVID-19 cases remain elevated or further increase. Given these risks, we will continue to plan and manage our business very cautiously. Due to the limited visibility we have on these risks, we are not providing sales or earnings guidance at this time.”

Investing.com – Wall Street closed modestly higher Thursday as gains in big tech offset losses in energy and financials amid weaker-than-expected data that exacerbated concerns about the strength of the economic recovery.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.17%, or  46 points. The S&P 500 rose 0.32%, while the Nasdaq Composite added 1.06% to close at a record high.
U.S. weekly jobless claims unexpectedly increased to 1.106 million last week, from 923,000 the prior week, and above forecasts for 925,000. The rise in claims comes after $600-a-week government stimulus checks lapsed as lawmakers failed to agree on another wave of fiscal stimulus.
""It seemed that the expiration of the $600 enhanced benefit provided by the CARES Act had coincided with a fundamental improvement in the labor market and economy, especially in the states that had suffered from a surge in COVID cases earlier in the summer,"" Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) said.
Other areas of the economy also showed signs of slowing as the Philadelphia Fed reported that its manufacturing index fell to a reading of 17.2 this month from 24.1 the prior month.
The duo of sluggish reports added to the worries about the economy just a day after the Federal Reserve's minutes showed policymakers were uncertain about the strength of the recovery amid the ongoing impact from the coronavirus pandemic.
Against the backdrop of wobbles in the recovery, value stocks – those that tend to outperform during periods of economic strength – faltered, with energy and financials leading to the downside.
Energy fell more than 1%, paced by a decline in oil prices as oversupply concerns persist a day after OPEC and its allies suggested that the pace of recovery in oil demand had been slower than expected. 
But big tech continued to rack up gains to keep losses in the broader market in check.
Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) rose 1%, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), all of which collectively make up about 20% of the S&P 500, rose more than 2%.
Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), meanwhile, cut its losses to close flat after reporting better-than-expected quarterly earnings and guidance.
""The company (NVDA) provided a solid FQ3 outlook with revenue expectations of $4.4B, well above our prior $4.14B outlook,"" Wedbush said as it upgraded its price target to $525 from $500.
Elsewhere,  Estee Lauder  (NYSE:EL) fell nearly 7% after swinging to a loss in the fiscal fourth quarter as sales slumped by nearly a third, pressured by lower demand for makeup during the lockdown.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc. asked the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) for approval to market a short-range interactive motion-sensing device that could help prevent children from being left behind in hot cars and boost theft-prevention systems.
The California automaker wants permission to use unlicensed millimeter-wave sensors that would operate at higher power levels than allowed under existing rules.
Tesla's device would utilize four transmit and three receive antennas driven by a radar front-end unit. Tesla says millimeter wave radar technology has advantages over other sensing systems like camera-based or in-seat occupant detection systems.
The radar-based system ""provides depth perception and can 'see' through soft materials, such as a blanket covering a child in a child restraint.""
Tesla added it ""can differentiate between a child and an object left on the seat, reducing the likelihood of false alarms"" and can detect ""micromovements like breathing patterns and heart rates, neither of which can be captured by cameras or in-seat sensors alone.""
Radar imaging, Tesla adds, can assess body size to optimize airbag deployment in a crash depending on whether an adult or child is seated, which it says would be more effective than existing weight-based, in-seat sensor systems.
It would also more accurately determine when to engage seat belt reminders.
The FCC is seeking public comment on Tesla's request through Sept. 21.
Tesla notes the FCC in 2018 granted a similar request for a device of Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google that works under identical operating parameters.
 Valeo  (PA:VLOF) North America submitted a request in March to the FCC for its in-vehicle safety-related monitoring device that would also detect children in cars. The request is pending. 

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration says more than 50 children died when left behind in hot cars in both 2019 and 2018. Of those incidents, 54% occurred because someone forgot a child.

U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer in San Francisco granted the automaker's dismissal motion, apart from its request to strike the SEC's effort to obtain injunctive relief and disgorgement.
The judge also rejected former VW Chief Executive Martin Winterkorn's motion to dismiss SEC claims against him.
VW had been caught using illegal software to cheat U.S. pollution tests of its vehicles in 2015, triggering a global backlash that has cost the company more than 29 billion euros ($34.4 billion).
Regulators and investors have argued that VW should have informed them sooner about the breadth of the scandal, while the automaker has said it had not realized how steep the financial fallout would be.
In its March 2019 lawsuit, the SEC accused VW of issuing more than $13 billion in bonds and asset-backed securities between April 2014 and May 2015 when executives knew more than 500,000 U.S. diesel vehicles had grossly excessive emissions.

The SEC and VW had no immediate comment. A lawyer for Winterkorn declined to comment.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -  American Airlines Group  Inc (O:AAL) said on Thursday it plans to suspend flights to 15 U.S. airports in October as travel demand remains low as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.
Congress has been weighing for weeks whether to grant U.S. airlines another $25 billion in payroll assistance that would keep tens of thousands of airline workers on the job for another six months and extend minimum service requirements.
American shares were off 0.5% in midday trading.
American said it will cancel just over 700 flights in October to and from those 15 airports but warned it could make additional cuts or could reconsider if Congress provides more assistance.
""This is the first step as American continues to evaluate its network and plans for additional schedule changes in the coming weeks,"" the airline said.
Delta Air Lines (N:DAL) and United Airlines (O:UAL) declined to comment on their schedule plans.
The debate over airline assistance has stalled as Congress has struggled to reach agreement on a broader coronavirus assistance package.
Some lawmakers think Congress and the White House may not reach a deal until September.
Major U.S. airlines that received portions of $25 billion in payroll assistance were required by the U.S. Transportation Department to maintain minimum flights through Sept. 30, but the government could opt to extend those requirements. American received $5.8 billion in payroll assistance.
Several airlines have been privately warning lawmakers they would be forced to suspend service to some smaller airports without assistance.
American will halt flights to Del Rio, Texas; Dubuque, Iowa; Florence, South Carolina; Greenville, North Carolina; Huntington, West Virginia; Joplin, Missouri; Kalamazoo-Battle Creek, Michigan; Lake Charles, Louisiana; New Haven, Connecticut; New Windsor, New York; Roswell, New Mexico; Sioux City, Iowa; Springfield, Illinois; Stillwater, Oklahoma, and Williamsport, Pennsylvania starting Oct. 7.
The Transportation Department said Thursday it will ""monitor ongoing access by the traveling public to the national air transportation system."" 
Travel and transportation sectors, including hotels, restaurants, performance venues, public transit and passenger railroad Amtrak, are seeking significant government assistance.

The U.S. Travel Association said Wednesday that travel ""businesses and workers cannot wait until September or until after the election. Congress must come together immediately to pass meaningful legislation.""

The agreement follows a $10.9 billion settlement in June of U.S. lawsuits claiming the company's weedkiller Roundup caused cancer.

""There is no admission of wrongdoing or liability by Bayer in the settlement agreements,"" Bayer said.
Women have claimed in lawsuits that the device, which is implanted in the fallopian tubes to permanently block the passage of eggs to the uterus, could pierce the tubes, and that the device's metal parts could become dislodged and migrate to other parts of the body.
Bayer said in 2018 that it would phase out the birth control product in the United States, a decision which the company said was due to declining sales of the implantable device and not based on safety concerns.

The IRS forecasts there will be about 229.4 million employee-classified jobs in 2021 -- about 37.2 million fewer than it had estimated last year, before the virus hit, according to updated data released Thursday. The statistics are an estimate how many of the W-2 tax forms that are used to track employee wages and withholding the agency will receive.
Lower rates of W-2 filings are seen persisting through at least 2027, with about 15.9 million fewer forms filed that year compared with prior estimates. That’s the last year for which the agency has published figures comparing assumptions prior to the pandemic and incorporating the virus’s effects.
W-2s are an imperfect measure for employment, because they don’t track the actual number of people employed. A single worker with several jobs would be required to fill out a form for each position. Still, the data suggest that it could take years for the U.S. economy to make up for the contraction suffered because of Covid-19.
The revised projections also show fewer filings of 1099-INT forms through 2027. That’s the paperwork used to report interest income -- and serves as a sign that low interest rates could persist.
There’s one category that is expected to rise: The IRS sees about 1.6 million more tax forms for gig workers next year compared with pre-pandemic estimates.
That boost “likely reflects assumptions with the shift to ‘work from home,’ which may be gig workers, or may just be that businesses are more willing to outsource work -- or have the status of their workers be independent contractors -- now that they work from home,” Mike Englund, the chief economist for Action Economics said.

1044,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 20, 2020 01:10PM ET</span>",Harley's activist investor backs business reboot strategy,"By Rajesh Kumar Singh
CHICAGO (Reuters) - An activist investor who shook up Harley-Davidson Inc (N:HOG) earlier this year said he is impressed with the changes initiated by new Chief Executive Jochen Zeitz to turn around the 117-year-old motorcycle company.
Impala Asset Management, the $2.4 billion hedge fund, pushed for the ouster of Zeitz's predecessor Matt Levatich in January. Months later, it tried to install two directors on Harley's board, asking for operational fixes to recover its market share in the United States, Europe and Japan. 
""For the first time in five to six years, the company is on the right track again,"" Bob Bishop, founder and chief investment officer at Impala, told Reuters.
Zeitz, who took the reins in February, is rebooting Harley's business by shifting the focus back to big bikes, traditional markets like the United States and Europe, and older and wealthier customers.
The new strategy echoes some of the changes Impala has been pushing for. Bishop said Harley should not pursue sales growth at any cost. Instead, it needs to market itself like Ferrari (NYSE:RACE) and become an ""aspirational"" brand, he added.
Bishop does not buy the argument that Harley's sales in the United States - its biggest market - are suffering because of an aging customer base. He dubbed that an ""excuse"" to cover the company's shrinking market share, citing evidence from Europe and Japan where industry sales of motorcycles have been growing despite older demographics.
""When you build up the brand, you will sell more bikes,"" Bishop said. ""Get rid of this idea that the demographics is killing them.""
Impala bought 1.2 million Harley shares in the quarter through June, increasing its stake to 2.52% from 1.73% in the first quarter of the year.
It also expects an agreement with Harley next month on a new independent board member, Bishop said, as part of an agreement reached in March to settle a board fight.
Under Zeitz, Harley has tightened supplies and cut production, driving up prices for pre-owned bikes, which used to be a drag on new motorcycle sales. It plans to reduce product portfolio and exit lower volume markets, though the company has not specified which ones. 
Bishop says models selling below 300 units a year and markets like India and Latin America that have been a ""cash drain"" could face the axe.
Harley declined to comment.
Robin Farley, an analyst at UBS, reckons the new strategy could shore up Harley's earnings by saving costs, but would not fix its demand problem. Hopes of higher profit, however, have driven up the company's shares about 50% since late April when Zeitz first shared his strategy.
Impala expects the restructuring to lift Harley's earnings to $4 a share next year from $3.36 last year and $5 a share in 2022 even if retail sales remain at 2019 levels.
Analysts surveyed by Refinitiv, on average, expect adjusted earnings of $2.48 per share in 2021 and $2.98 in 2022.

""This is a fundamentally strong company that just lost its way,"" Bishop said.

Known for Maggi soups and bouillon cubes, Nestle has been investing in plant-based food to make its prepared dishes unit trendier and more appealing to consumers wishing to lower their meat intake.
The new ""Garden Gourmet"" tuna made with pea protein will be available in glass jars in the chilled aisle of Swiss supermarkets and can be used in salads, sandwiches and pizzas. Ready-to-eat sandwiches will also be sold in some stores, Nestle said. 
Developed within nine months by Nestle's Swiss research facilities, the tuna is the group's first plant-based seafood product to hit the market. Soy-based burgers, mince meat, sausages and chicken nuggets are already available. 
Nestle said last month that increased at-home consumption during the COVID-19 pandemic boosted demand for its Garden Gourmet plant-based products in the first half of 2020.
The group's sales of plant-based meat alternatives reached around 200 million Swiss francs ($218.7 million) last year.

1053,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 20, 2020 11:27AM ET</span>",American Airlines Drops Flights to 15 Smaller U.S. Cities,"(Bloomberg) -- American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) Group Inc. plans to cease flights to 15 smaller U.S. cities because of low demand, beginning the first phase of dropping markets from its network as the coronavirus pandemic keeps millions of flyers off planes.
The reductions are effective Oct. 7, shortly after the expiration of service requirements tied to federal payroll aid, American said in a statement Thursday. Flights will end to such destinations as Springfield, Illinois, and New Haven, Connecticut, the carrier said. Additional changes are planned in the coming weeks.
American’s move heralds a likely wave of cutbacks by U.S. airlines if the government doesn’t extend a new financial lifeline. Carriers that accepted federal assistance to help cover payroll costs had to agree to maintain minimum service levels to locations they were flying to as of March 1. While the Transportation Department later authorized a halt to some flights because of sustained low demand, the broader restrictions are set to expire Oct. 1.
Lawmakers are considering a second round of aid, but progress has been stymied by a political stalemate over another stimulus package for the U.S. economy.
“The airline will continue to re-assess plans for these and other markets as an extension of the Payroll Support Program remains under deliberation,” American said. The carrier will release its updated October schedule on Aug. 29 and its November plan by late September. For now, the first round of suspensions are only in place through Nov. 3.
Travel demand in the U.S. remains at 25% to 30% of last year’s levels, based on passengers screened by the Transportation Security Administration at domestic airports.
Other cities that will lose flights under American’s plan are Del Rio, Texas; Dubuque and Sioux City, Iowa; Florence, South Carolina; Greenville, North Carolina; Huntington, West Virginia; Joplin, Missouri; Kalamazoo/Battle Creek, Michigan; Lake Charles, Louisiana; New Windsor, New York; Roswell, New Mexico; Stillwater, Oklahoma; and Williamsport, Pennsylvania.

1054,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 20, 2020 11:25AM ET</span>",Fear fading on Wall Street as investors learn to love the new bull market,"By April Joyner and Tom Westbrook
(Reuters) - Fear is ebbing on Wall Street, with stocks on a bull run in the midst of the global coronavirus pandemic. 
The Cboe Volatility Index (VIX), known as Wall Street's ""fear gauge,"" is near its lowest level since late February and options markets are showing diminishing concerns of a near-term drop in equities. 
The S&P 500's (SPX) run to fresh highs has come as some of Wall Street's biggest banks, including Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), UBS Global Wealth Management and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), turn more bullish on stocks and are urging clients to remain exposed to equities. The index ended at a record high on Tuesday, confirming a bull market, according to one definition. 
Investors may well heed their advice: nearly 80% of fund managers surveyed by BofA Global Research, the highest level in more than a decade, expect the global economy to grow over the next year. The survey also showed falling allocations to cash, another sign of increasing bullishness. 
The growing optimism is in contrast to the fear and gloom that prevailed on Wall Street only months ago, after the S&P 500 plunged 34% in just 23 trading days and the economy entered a recession that would turn out to be its worst since the Great Depression.
Although financial pain remains acute for many Americans, monetary support from the Federal Reserve and expectations for advances in fighting the coronavirus pandemic have made investors more confident in betting on the future, said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial (NYSE:PRU).
""You have a market that sees that we're getting closer and closer to a more normal world,"" she said.
Options markets are among the areas reflecting fading investor worries. Demand for protection against drops in U.S. equities of 30% or more has fallen as volatility has eased in recent months, said Paul Sandhu, BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY) Asset Management's head of multi-assets quant solutions in the Asia-Pacific region.
""The fear has definitely lessened over the (past) couple of months,"" he said. 
Meanwhile, selling of protective put options in individual stocks is up over the past week, said Christopher Murphy, co-head of derivatives strategy at Susquehanna Financial Group. Put sellers profit if the underlying stock does not drop to a specified level. 
The put selling suggests investors are less worried about the downside, Murphy said. 
In futures markets, net long equity positioning is now at its highest level since early March, with increases in both large-cap and small-cap stocks,  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) data showed.
The increasingly bullish positioning dovetails with the messages coming from big Wall Street banks. Goldman Sachs, for instance, raised its year-end target for the S&P 500 earlier this week to 3,600 from 3,000, citing expectations for outsized growth in U.S. corporate earnings and gross domestic product next year. 
Stocks have dipped since Tuesday, but several market strategists said they saw the pullback as routine rather than a sign that equities had been overbought.
Yet there are plenty of reasons for investors to be nervous and some remain skeptical of buying near all-time highs. 
One concern is the potential of market volatility stemming from delayed or contested results in November's U.S. presidential election. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) fell 5% in two weeks on the heels of a vote recount in the 2000 presidential election, UBS noted. 
Other risks include a resurgence of COVID-19 cases, delays in a vaccine or delays by lawmakers in providing more stimulus to the still-ailing economy.
Some of that uncertainty has been reflected in the price of gold, a popular haven that has climbed to record highs this month. Prices recently got an additional boost after  Berkshire Hathaway Inc  (N:BRKa) disclosed a stake in  Barrick Gold Corp  (TO:ABX).
Still, some investors believe the prospect of economic recovery now outweighs those risks. Keith Lerner, chief market strategist at Truist/SunTrust Advisory Services, is maintaining an overweight position in U.S. equities.

""We're not taking anything off the table,"" he said. ""We're staying with the primary trend, which is still higher.""

1059,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 20, 2020 09:45AM ET</span>",Drugmakers slash prices to obtain China's bulk-buy contracts: state media,"BEIJING/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Drugmakers have slashed prices by up to 95% to win state contracts in China's largest bidding round of its drug procurement programme, state media said on Thursday.
Beijing has pushed forward a national scheme where global pharmaceutical giants and domestic copycats have to go through a bidding process and chop prices low enough to elbow out competitors to be eligible to sell their products in bulk at public hospitals.
In the latest bidding round for contracts worth hundreds of billions yuan in total, drugmakers cut prices by 53% on average, state media Xinhua reported, citing preliminary bidding results.
It involves 55 types of medicines, more than the previous two rounds of bidding.
A total of 56 drugs were open for bidding, including some products that contributed more than $1 billion each to foreign drugmakers' sales in 2019 but face challenges from generic versions offered by local drugmakers, including AstraZeneca Plc's (L:AZN) heart disease treatment Brilinta, and blood-thinning blockbuster Eliquis jointly developed by  Pfizer  Inc (N:PFE) and Bristol Myers Squibb Co (N:BMY).
However, foreign companies quoted high in Thursday's bidding and barely secured any contracts, said ICBC International Research analyst Zhang Jialin.
More expensive brand-name drugs still had opportunities in the market not covered by the national procurement scheme, thanks to their higher awareness among patients and doctors compared with cheaper generic drugs, Zhang said.
Sharp (OTC:SHCAY) price cuts promised by Chinese companies for fear of losing government contracts may not be practical, said Wang Yue, a professor at Peking University's School of Health Humanities.
""When the market changes, like when labour and logistics costs rise, the (low drug) prices are hard to sustain,"" Wang told Reuters.
Wang said he also worried that the bulk-buy scheme might drive smaller drugmakers to the brink of a loss.
    ""The buying group is over centralized and accounts for a major share of the China market,"" Wang said. ""Many companies actually have no power to bargain with the government.""
For most products in Thursday's bidding, if only one company wins the bid to supply a certain drug, the winner can bag up to half of the total procurement volume in the first year.
Some 80% of the volume can be shared if a product has at least four bid-winners, the procurement authorities said in an official guideline last month.

1060,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 20, 2020 09:40AM ET</span>",Stocks - Wall Street Opens Lower on Jobless Rise; Dow Down 75 Pts,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened markedly lower on Thursday after the first weekly rise in initial jobless claims in nearly five months sharpened fears that the recovery may be stalling. 
The Labor Department reported that the number of people making initial claims for jobless benefits rose by nearly 200,000 to 1.106 million, suggesting that the rate of layoffs remains high despite a recent improvement in the public health picture across the south and west of the country. Just under half a million more applied for Pandemic Unemployment Assistance, a program whose benefits have been halved since the start of August. Over 28 million Americans were claiming benefits as of the start of the month, the most recent week for which numbers are available.
There was further evidence of the economy slowing down as the Philadelphia Federal Reserve's manufacturing index fell by more than expected to 17.2, with the employment component suffering most.
The news came a day after the Federal Reserve's latest policy meeting minutes showed heightened concern at a loss of momentum in the economy, but still gave no clear hint as to when and under what conditions it may ease monetary policy further.
By 9:45 AM ET (1345 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 75 points, or 0.3%, at 27,618 points, while the S&P 500 was down 0.3% and the Nasdaq Composite fell a little less than 0.1%. 
Among individual stocks,  Estee Lauder  (NYSE:EL) stock fell 7.3% after the cosmetics group disappointed with its quarterly update, giving a weak outlook and announcing 2,000 job cuts.
 Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) ADRs fell 1.5% after a strong quarter driven by the group's cloud-hosting operations was overshadowed by an appeal to President Trump that reminded investors of its vulnerability to U.S. trade-related measures.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock continued its parabolic rise, gaining 1.2% to its now-customary all-time high. On Wednesday, the stock had cracked the $2 trillion valuation, only two years after reaching $1 trillion for the first time. In those two years, global growth has slowed sharply, the sustainability of a business model depending on a Chinese supply chain has come into question, and global mobile phone shipments have fallen more than 5% from their peak. The company has responded by aggressively building out music and video streaming services.
In other markets, Crude Oil Futures also fell as the jobless claims numbers intensified fears of a weakening in demand as summer ends, while Gold Futures fell 1.5% on fears that the Fed's attempts to reflate the economy will struggle.

1061,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 20, 2020 09:36AM ET</span>","Alibaba Appeals to Trump, Says its Role Is to Support America","(Bloomberg) -- Chinese e-commerce giant  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd. offered reassurances that its presence in the U.S. is benign, in a bid to remove itself from the cross hairs of President Donald Trump.
“As the world’s largest e-commerce platform, Alibaba’s primary commercial focus in the U.S. is to support American brands, retailers, small businesses and farmers to sell to consumers and trade partners in China as well as other key markets around the world,” Chief Executive Officer Daniel Zhang said on an earnings call.
“We believe global trade will continue, and Alibaba’s active pursuit of our mission ‘to make it easy to do business anywhere’ is fully aligned with the interests of both China and the U.S.,” he said.
Earlier this month, the U.S. president signed two executive orders targeting Chinese-owned social media platform TikTok and messaging app WeChat. Trump later said he was considering taking action against other Chinese companies.
Washington’s “Clean Network” program announced by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo also urged U.S. companies to cut ties with Chinese firms, including cloud providers such as Alibaba, Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) Ltd. and Baidu Inc (NASDAQ:BIDU)., for sensitive American data.
But this week, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross told Fox Business News that no formal proceedings are underway against Alibaba at this time.
Zhang said the company is closely monitoring the latest shift in U.S. policies toward Chinese companies, which he described as being in a “very fluid situation.”
“We are assessing the situation and any potential impact carefully and thoroughly, and will take necessary actions to comply with any new regulations,” Zhang said.

1062,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 20, 2020 09:35AM ET</span>",Airbnb bans parties in COVID-19 fight,"(Reuters) - No more parties and events in homes listed on Airbnb, the short-term home rental company said on Thursday as it tries to enforce strict social-distancing norms to fight the COVID-19 pandemic.
The new rules include a cap on occupancy at 16, with hosts or guests who try to skirt the rules facing a ban from Airbnb's community and even legal action, the company said on Thursday. 
""Instituting a global ban on parties and events is in the best interest of public health,"" Airbnb said in a statement, adding that the ban applies to all future bookings.
Airbnb said 73% of its listings globally already ban parties in their house rules, while some hosts allow small parties such as baby showers or birthday parties.
Last year, Airbnb began imposing much stricter limits, starting with a global ban on ""party houses"" or listings that create persistent neighborhood nuisance.
Airbnb has also updated its policies in light of the pandemic, removing both the ""event friendly"" search filter and ""parties and events allowed"" house rules.
The global ban comes a day after Airbnb said it filed confidentially for an initial public offering with U.S. regulators, setting the stage for one of 2020's marquee stock market debuts.
The potential IPO underscores a rebound in parts of the travel industry, which was battered this year by restrictions and shutdowns due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

San Francisco-based Airbnb said in July that customers had booked more than 1 million nights in a single day for the first time since March 3, in part as U.S. travelers shy away from hotels and prefer to drive to local vacation rentals.

Zalando launched the investigation in June after former art director Fernando Torres accused the company of failing to respond to complaints in 2018 about employees who resisted booking black models and made comments about their skin tone.
The death in police custody of African-American George Floyd has prompted a groundswell of concern about racism around the world, prompting many companies to make pledges to hire more Black staff and clamp down on discrimination.
Zalando said it had been unable to confirm the core allegations and was therefore refraining from disciplinary action, even though it had found instances of language and behaviour it said were perceived as insensitive or discriminatory.
It also uncovered and investigated six unrelated complaints, which it said could be categorized as micro-aggressions towards members of marginalised groups and said it was responding by making anti-discrimination and communication training mandatory.
Europe's biggest online-only fashion retailer said it had reviewed its image and influencer guidelines to make sure it continued to champion Black people as well as alternative identities and lifestyles.

It will also invest in diversifying its supplier base to support more Black and minorities brands and has updated guidance on whistleblowing to encourage staff to report discriminatory incidents.

1064,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 20, 2020 09:09AM ET</span>",S&P 500 Record That Was Months in the Making Viewed as Bullish,"(Bloomberg) -- The fact the S&P 500 index took many months to make a fresh record is a positive backdrop for further gains, according to Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP.
“New all-time highs are historically a very bullish indicator for future returns,” Chris Murphy, a derivatives strategist at the firm, wrote in a note Wednesday. That’s “even more so” the case when the unprecedented level comes a number of months after the earlier peak, he said.
The S&P 500 eclipsed its February high when it closed at 3,389.78 on Aug. 18, capping the fastest-ever return to a record after a drop of at least 20%. Since 1960, the index’s one-year returns after hitting an unprecedented level have been almost 12%, according to UBS Group AG (SIX:UBSG).
 Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). predicts the S&P 500 will reach 3,600 by the end of the year. At the same time, skeptics argue equities face risks from the rocky path to economic recovery following the global health crisis.
One unusual aspect of the benchmark’s run up is that it broke new ground even though the Cboe Volatility Index, a measure of implied equity swings, remains comparatively elevated at about 24, versus its five-year average of 17.
The are 19 instances of the S&P 500 hitting a record with the VIX above 20, including Tuesday, according to Susquehanna. Most of the rest occurred from 1997 through 2000 during the dot-com boom.
The VIX has calmed from highs above 80 at the height of the Covid-19 uncertainty in financial markets. Last month, Evercore ISI technical strategist Rich Ross said levels below 26 could pave the way to 3,500 on the S&P 500.

1065,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 20, 2020 08:55AM ET</span>","Alibaba beats estimates as pandemic fuels online, cloud computing demand","(Reuters) - China's  Alibaba  Group Holding Ltd (N:BABA) beat quarterly revenue and profit estimates on Thursday, as its core commerce and cloud computing businesses continued to grow following China's emergence from the coronavirus lockdown.
Sales from the commerce business alone jumped 34% to 133.32 billion yuan ($19.27 billion) in the quarter ending in June, slightly slower than a year earlier but still enough to prod its shares higher after the results.
The company's stock has soared 23% this year as investors globally poured money into technology businesses seen as ""stay-at-home"" winners from the pandemic, and Alibaba said it had bounced back from a hit to Chinese consumer spending at the start of this year.
""Our domestic core commerce business has fully recovered to pre-COVID-19 levels across the board, while cloud computing revenue grew 59% year-over-year,"" Chief Financial Officer Maggie Wu said in a statement.
Alibaba is one of the big businesses seen as a potential target if President Donald Trump makes further moves against Chinese companies, following restrictions on Chinese-owned video platform TikTok and Tencent's WeChat. 
""Today, we face uncertainties from not only the global pandemic but also increasing tensions between U.S. and China,"" Chief Executive Officer Daniel Zhang said.
""We are closely monitoring the latest shift in U.S. government policies towards Chinese companies which is a very fluid situation.""
On Monday, JD (NASDAQ:JD).com (HK:9618) beat analysts' estimates for quarterly sales, while  Pinduoduo  Inc (O:PDD) is expected to report second-quarter results on Friday. Alibaba's net income attributable to ordinary shareholders more than doubled to 47.59 billion yuan from 21.25 billion yuan.
Excluding items, the company earned 14.82 yuan per American depository share (ADS) versus expectations of 13.78 yuan, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

The company and other cosmetic brands have been struggling in recent months with consumers adapting to the new work-from-home lifestyle and ordering more skincare products than makeup.
This led to Estee Lauder posting a 32% decline in sales in the fourth quarter, pushing its shares down about 6% in premarket trading.
The COVID-19 crisis has also made the M.A.C. brand owner reassess its business as consumers increasingly shop for beauty products online.
Estee Lauder said on Thursday it would cut about 1,500 to 2,000 jobs or about 3% of its workforce globally and also expects to close about 10%-15% of its freestanding stores.
Sales of makeup brands such as M.A.C. and Too Faced have taken a hit on falling demand for the New York-based company's foundations and lip products. Overall annual sales for its makeup brands fell 18% as the COVID-19 pandemic offset the 5% growth seen in the first half of the year.
Estee Lauder forecast first-quarter adjusted profit per share to be between 80 cents and 85 cents, below estimates of $1.22, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
The company also expects sales to decline between 12% and 13%, compared to expectations of an 11.42% drop.
Net sales fell 32% to $2.43 billion in the fourth quarter ended June 30, missing estimates of $2.45 billion. Excluding items, the company reported a loss of 53 cents per share, much bigger than Wall Street estimates of a 19-cent loss.

Still, the company reinstated its quarterly dividend payment after suspending it in April.

1067,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 20, 2020 08:46AM ET</span>",Goldman Sachs to offer clearing services via LCH’s ForexClear,"By Olga Cotaga
LONDON (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs (N:GS) will offer clearing facilities for some currency derivative products on the London-based clearing house LCH's ForexClear service, the bank said on Thursday.
Clearing or settling trades via exchanges or clearing houses is well established in equities and other asset classes. But lots of trades in financial products - particularly in the forex market - are still done ""over-the-counter"", where there is no central clearing house backing up the deals.
Clearing ensures financial market trades are completed even if one side of the transaction goes wrong. 
Centralised clearing is starting to increase in the $6.6 trillion a day foreign exchange market, but this is largely limited to currency futures which make up only a tiny fraction of the total market.
New regulations are gradually making it more expensive for investment banks to trade derivatives and this is encouraging them to send some trades for clearing to exchanges like the CME Group (O:CME) and the  London Stock Exchange  (L:LSE) and its clearing division LCH.
LCH's ForexClear provides clearing services for currency non-deliverable forwards as well as for the currency options spot and forwards market. 
Non-deliverable currency forwards are products where participants take a bet on a currency but settle in a different currency, mostly the U.S. dollar. This has gradually shifted from a bilateral trading model to a more centralised trading structure.
NDFs are the only type of FX derivative which are showing the biggest growth rate in clearing, which has led to a greater concentration of trading in these instruments in the main currency hubs globally, including New York, London, Singapore and Hong Kong.
London dominates market share in NDF trading, with Britain more than doubling its share to 46% in 2019 from 20% in 2016, data from the Bank of International Settlements showed.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are set to edge lower at the open Thursday, with investors wary ahead of the latest employment data, the day after the Federal Reserve expressed concerns about the state of the U.S. recovery. Losses are limited, however, amid positive comments regarding the U.S.-China relationship.
At 7 AM ET (1100 GMT), S&P 500 Futures traded 14 points, or 0.4%, lower, the Dow Futures contract fell 85 points, or 0.3%, while Nasdaq 100 Futures dropped 64 points, or 0.6%.
The S&P 500 fell 0.4% to close Wednesday at 3,374.85, after surging above its previous all-time intraday of 3,393.52 earlier in the session. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.3%, while the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.6%. 
The indexes were weighed by the U.S. central bank indicating that the path to economic recovery for the U.S. economy from the Covid-19 outbreak remains highly uncertain.
With this in mind, investors will pay particular attention to the weekly initial jobless claims data, at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT), for the latest update on the health of the U.S. labor market.
After falling below one million last week for the first time since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic in March, this week’s release is expected to have fallen further to a new five-month low of 925,000.
Continuing claims, which are reported with a one-week time lag, are expected to fall by nearly half a million to 15.00 million.
Helping the tone Thursday were comments from the Chinese commerce ministry, stating that the U.S. and China have agreed to meet soon to review the progress of their “phase one” trade deal.
The postponement of talks over the weekend sparked fears that this deal, which paused a damaging trade war between the world’s two largest economies, could fall apart.
The retail sector is scheduled to see earnings from warehouse chain BJs Wholesale Club (NYSE:BJ) and off-price retailer Ross Stores (NASDAQ:ROST). There are also updates from Chinese e-commerce giant  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA), as well as cosmetics group  Estee Lauder  (NYSE:EL) and biotech startup Sorrento Therapeutics (NASDAQ:SRNE).
Oil prices weakened, as the Fed minutes amounted to a warning about the recovery in demand, while U.S. oil inventories dropped for a fourth straight week, but by only 1.6 million barrels, less than expected.
Members of OPEC+, a group of major oil producers, also warned Wednesday that the global rebound in demand was taking place at a slower pace than expected, and that a second wave of the Covid-19 virus could do even more damage.
U.S. crude futures traded 1% lower at $42.70 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract fell 1% to $44.91. 
Elsewhere, gold futures fell 1.8% to $1,935.45/oz, retreating after the dollar rebounded on the back of the Fed’s comments. EUR/USD traded flat at 1.1833 after a similar sharp drop.

Investing.com -- For months, the mantra has been that Covid-19 will devastate business travel, if not forever, then at least over any meaningful investment horizon.  The impact on leisure travel may not last quite as long but is set to be just as acute in the short term.
No surprise, then, that the hotel industry appears to be drawing the consequences.
 Accor  (PA:ACCP) is looking at a tie-up with U.K.-based InterContinental Hotels Group (LON:IHG), according to the newspaper Le Figaro.
The French newspaper reported on Thursday that Accor CEO Sebastien Bazin has created a team led by CFO Jean-Jacques Morin to study the possibilities and retained M&A specialists Rothschild and Centerview to advise them. The group didn’t confirm the story.
A merger between the two would create the world’s largest hotel operator with over 10,000 establishments, leap-frogging the current sector Marriott (NASDAQ:MAR), which has just under 7,000. Even after some likely capacity rationalizations, it would be likely to retain this lead.
However, it would be unlikely to be dominated by Accor, which may be one reason why Le Figaro says Bazin isn’t as keen on the idea as his supervisory board, since he would not be the lead candidate to be CEO of the merged group. Keith Barr, IHG’s 50-year-old American CEO, has plenty of gas left in his tank, and his group is worth over 8 billion euros ($9.6 billion) compared to Accor’s 6.2 billion.
Moreover, IHG has the better business momentum right now, losing only around 260 million euros at an operating level in the first half of the year, compared to Accor’s 1.36 billion loss.
For Accor, the main appeal of any form of alliance would be to strengthen its footprint in North America, where IHG’s Holiday Inn chain has a strong position in the mid-market segment, which has suffered less than other segments in the current downturn. It was Holiday Inn's performance that ensured IHG ended with the lowest drop in revenue per available room (RevPAR) in the second quarter, a mere 74.9% compared to over 80% for all of its main rivals. 
The U.S.-heavy Holiday Inn family of brands complements the position of Accor’s Ibis and Novotel brands in Europe. That offers the prospect of synergies in areas such as reservations and loyalty programs.
Even the most wildly successful merger (and deals of this scale are rarely as successful as the bankers promoting them promise) would hardly be a panacea. Bazin said on an investor call this month that as much as 15% of the business travel market may disappear permanently, leaving Accor - which owns more of its branded hotels than its rivals - uniquely exposed to an overcapacity problem.
All the same, the prospect of a deal was enough to push Accor shares and IHG shares up 1.4% and 1.1% respectively on a morning when both the CAC 40 and FTSE 100 were heavily in the red. More gains should be expected if the two groups should ever get round to talking about the idea seriously.

1075,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 20, 2020 05:30AM ET</span>","Shares in hoteliers Accor, IHG rise after reported merger interest","PARIS (Reuters) - Shares in France's  Accor  (PA:ACCP) rallied on Thursday after Le Figaro newspaper reported it had examined a potential merger with British rival InterContinental Hotels (IHG) (L:IHG) that would create the world's biggest hotel group. 
The hospitality sector has been hit hard by the coronavirus crisis as travel dwindles, forcing many hotel owners to temporarily halt bookings and shore up their finances. 
Le Figaro said no formal approach had been made by Accor, which is behind brands such as Ibis and Movenpick, to IHG, which owns Holiday Inn and Crowne Plaza. Based on current prices, a combined firm could have a market value of about $17 billion. 
Without citing sources, it added Accor's management board was in favour of a deal, but Accor chairman and CEO Sebastien Bazin, who had set up an internal taskforce on the matter, was more cautious about moving ahead. 
An Accor spokeswoman said the company did not comment on market rumours. IHG declined to comment. 
Accor shares were up 1.9%. The company, which faces higher interest payments after it was downgraded to junk status by ratings agency S&P Global earlier this week, has been punished by investors this year, with its shares down over 43% so far. 
Shares in IHG, down around 23% this year, were up 0.35% at 0825 GMT after surging as much as 3.1% in early trading, outperforming a falling FTSE-100 index. 
A marriage between the two firms would propel them far ahead of U.S. rival Marriott by number of hotel rooms, with over 1.6 million between the two. 
It could also make geographical sense, with Accor and its brands more skewed towards Europe, while IHG has larger operations in the United States and is also growing fast in Greater China. 

Both firms have announced job cuts and cost savings plans in recent weeks as they try to cope with the fallout from the pandemic.

(Reuters) - European stocks were hit by a wave of selling in global equity markets on Thursday after the U.S. Federal Reserve signalled a long and difficult path of recovery for the world's largest economy.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index (STOXX) fell 1%, led by miners (SXPP) due to weaker metal prices. Other economically sensitive sectors such as banks (SX7P) and automakers (SXAP) and oil and gas (SXEP) dropped between 1.2% and 2%.
The Fed minutes showed that policymakers were doubtful of a quick economic rebound and suggested stimulus measures for a longer period, pushing the Wall Street indexes off their all-time highs on Wednesday.
""The change in mood has been clearly down to the release of the minutes which reminded investors that the economy is still not in good shape,"" said Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at FXTM.
The minutes also disappointed some investors who were expecting the Fed to discuss capping government bond yields as part of a broader policy review.
""That the Fed appeared reluctant to step up further stimulus efforts imminently, disappointed the bulls who were expecting further clues on the trajectory of monetary policy.""
A full bounceback from the euro zone's deepest recession on record will take two years or more, a Reuters poll showed, with economists saying there is a high risk of the job recovery reversing by the end of 2020.
Worries over rising coronavirus cases in Europe also kept investors on edge. Norway said it will impose a 10-day quarantine on all people arriving from Britain, Austria, Greece and Ireland from Aug. 22.
Among individual stocks, Chilean miner  Antofagasta  (L:ANTO) fell 3.8% after it posted a 22.4% plunge in first-half core earnings on lower copper sales, but said it would pay an interim dividend.
Swedish private equity firm EQT (ST:EQTAB) slumped 10.6% as it said the pandemic led to fewer investments for the company this year and sharply slower pace of exits.
 Intercontinental Hotels Group  (L:IHG) rose 0.4% and France's  Accor  (PA:ACCP) gained 2.5% after a French newspaper reported the hotel operators examined a merger.

German real estate firm Tag Immobilien (DE:TEGG) jumped 4.1% as it confirmed its guidance for 2020 and said raising it during the year was a possibility.

Investing.com - European stock markets are traded sharply lower Thursday, weighed by concerns from the Federal Reserve about the state of the U.S. recovery.
At 3:45 AM ET (0735 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.8% lower, the CAC 40 in France fell 0.9% and the U.K.'s FTSE index was down 0.6%.
The path to economic recovery for the U.S. economy from the Covid-19 outbreak remains highly uncertain, the Federal Reserve warned, according to minutes from its latest meeting, released late Wednesday.
“The minutes to the July 29th FOMC meeting are not especially reassuring,” said analyst James Knightley at ING, in a research note. 
“The commentary suggests an ongoing weak economic backdrop whereby inflation remains persistently low yet there is little inclination to offer additional imminent support to the economy.”
In Europe, the minutes of the latest European Central Bank monetary policy meeting are due to be published later Thursday. 
Looking at the corporate sector,  Antofagasta  (LON:ANTO) stock dropped 2.9% after the Chile-based miner posted a lower profit for the first half of the year as copper production and prices declined amid the pandemic.
 Premier Oil  (LON:PMO) dropped 23% after it plans to ask investors for another $300 million in new equity ahead of the acquisition of  BP  's (LON:BP) North Sea assets. The firm already planned to rise $230 million through an equity raise.
Shares in French hotels group  Accor  (PA:ACCP) rose 2.6% after Le Figaro newspaper reported that the company had examined a potential merger with British rival InterContinental Hotels, up 2.3%.
Frasers (LON:FRAS) climbed 9.7% after seeing ""a semblance of normality"" returning, while reporting a 20% drop in annual profits as lockdown store closures led to ""the most challenging year"" in its history.
Meanwhile, tensions between the U.S. and China, the globe’s two economic superpowers, were ratcheted up another notch after the U.S. announced it is suspending its extradition treaty with Hong Kong and ending reciprocal tax treatment with the former British colony. 
The moves are part of the Trump administration’s efforts to pressure China over the imposition of a national security law that curtailed many of Hong Kong’s freedoms.
Oil prices weakened, as the Fed minutes amounted to a warning about the recovery in demand, while U.S. oil inventories dropped for a fourth straight week, but by only 1.6 million barrels, less than expected.
Members of OPEC+, a group of major oil producers, warned Wednesday that the global rebound in demand was taking place at a slower pace than expected, and a second wave of the Covid-19 virus could do even more damage.
U.S. crude futures traded 0.9% lower at $42.73 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract fell 0.6% to $45.08. 
Elsewhere, gold futures fell 1.2% to $1,947.20/oz, retreating after the dollar rebounded on the back of the Fed’s comments. EUR/USD traded 0.2% higher at 1.1858 after a similar sharp drop.

TOKYO/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Asian equities and U.S. futures fell on Thursday, hurt by the U.S. Federal Reserve's cautious view of the economy, tensions with China and new clusters of coronavirus infections. 
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan slid 1.79%, the biggest daily decline in five weeks. U.S. stock futures were down 0.55%.
Australian stocks dropped 0.91% due to concern that ties with China will worsen further after a report that Australian regulators will reject acquisitions by a Chinese company.
Shares in China fell 1.28% due to dwindling expectations for additional monetary easing after the People's Bank of China kept a benchmark lending rate unchanged on Thursday.
Japanese stocks slid 1.06%. South Korean stocks tumbled 3.26%, the biggest daily decline since June 15, amid a spike in coronavirus cases in Seoul.
Euro Stoxx 50 futures were down 1.36%, German DAX futures fell 1.31%, and FTSE futures was off 1.27%.
Market sentiment had been bullish up until Fed policymakers' comments highlighted uncertainties over the U.S. recovery, with the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq hitting all-time highs driven largely by Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL).. 
The iPhone maker's shares rose 1.4% to make the first publicly listed U.S. company reach $2 trillion in market capitalisation, while strong results from retailers  Target  (NYSE:TGT) and Lowe's (NYSE:LOW) also lifted sentiment.
The positive mood quickly faded, however, after several Fed members said additional easing may be needed because a rebound in employment was already slowing.
The downbeat tone spilled over into Asia, which weighed on equities and oil futures but pushed gold prices higher due to economic uncertainty.
""It was a decent day for banks, Apple, and  Nike  (NYSE:NKE) but everything else was in the reverse after the Fed said economic conditions will be difficult for a while,"" said Jamie Cox, managing partner at Harris Financial Group.
""We've seen some good numbers out of retail but there's uncertainty that these companies won't replicate those earnings without some stimulus.""
Minutes from the Fed's July meeting showed the swift rebound in employment seen in May and June had likely slowed and that additional ""substantial improvement"" in the labour market would hinge on a ""broad and sustained"" reopening of business activity.
The readout on Fed discussions provides hints to further action that the U.S. central bank could take in September. No change in interest rate policy is expected until end-2021. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.31%, the S&P 500 lost 0.44% and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.57%.
Spot gold rose 0.82% to $1,945.43 per ounce on Thursday, recovering from a 3.6% tumble on Wednesday as the cautious mood boosted demand for the safe harbour asset. [GOL/]
The yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes fell slightly to 0.6623% while those on the 20-year bond also fell to 1.1725%.
Some bond investors were also disappointed after the Fed minutes showed central bankers downplayed the chance of capping bond yields.
The dollar index, which reflects the greenback's value against six leading trading currencies, steadied at 92.983.
Oil prices edged lower over lingering concerns of weak global fuel demand after data showed that U.S. crude stockpiles fell 1.6 million barrels last week.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - A former Warburg Pincus LLC managing director focusing on Asia real estate has left the firm to explore opportunities with Hillhouse Capital Group, sources with knowledge of the matter told Reuters.
Joe Gagnon, who was once Warburg's head of Asia real estate, left the U.S. private equity firm last month, two of the sources said.
He is in talks with Asia-focused private equity firm Hillhouse to develop its real estate capabilities, said one of the sources, adding his role there has not been finalized.
The two firms declined to comment. Gagnon，who sources said is on garden leave in the United States, did not respond to a query for comment.
The people declined to be identified as they were not authorised to speak to the media.
Founded in 2005 by Chinese businessman Zhang Lei with seed funding from Yale University's endowment, Hillhouse is best known for its early investments in Chinese tech giants Tencent Holdings (HK:0700), JD (NASDAQ:JD).COM Inc (HK:9618) and Baidu Inc (O:BIDU).
It raised $10.6 billion in Asia's biggest private equity fund two years ago, which invests across the healthcare, consumer, technology and services sectors globally, with a focus on the region.
Hillhouse does not have a real estate fund or a team specializing in the sector, according to its website. The firm was part of a consortium that won a $11.6 billion bid https://www.reuters.com/article/us-glp-m-a/chinese-buyout-group-wins-11-6-billion-bid-to-buy-global-logistic-properties-idUSKBN19Z0N2 in 2017 to buy out Singapore-based Global Logistic Properties (GLP), Asia's biggest warehouse operator.
It is also an investor in Chinese online real estate broker KE Holdings Inc (N:BEKE), which owns property brokerage brand Lianjia and housing transactions platform Beike. The company last week raised $2.12 billion in a New York Stock Exchange initial public offering, the largest Chinese IPO in the United States since March 2018.
Formerly based in Beijing, Gagnon had a 15-year career with Warburg Pincus, according to his LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) profile. He oversaw Warburg Pincus' real estate portfolio, including logistics platform ESR and property rental firm Nova, with other senior partners in China and Southeast Asia.
Prior to that, he was with GE Capital real estate in New York.

TOKYO (Reuters) -  Rakuten Inc  (T:4755) Chief Executive Hiroshi Mikitani has urged Japan's government to review its entry restrictions on foreign nationals, saying prolonged imposition of COVID-19 curbs risks tarnishing Japan's appeal and causing innovation to stagnate.
The head of the e-commerce group adds a high-profile voice from corporate Japan to protests by Western business lobbies over the curbs, which the government put in place to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus.
Many countries have imposed travel curbs to battle the pandemic but Japan's are among the strictest, effectively banning entry with few exceptions of not only tourists but long-term visa holders from more than 140 countries.
That means many permanent and other long-term residents remain stuck outside Japan due to the restrictions or face such gut-wrenching decisions as whether to leave Japan to attend a funeral or care for sick family members, for fear they will not be allowed back into the country.
""As a result of these restrictions, not only is it extremely difficult for foreign nationals to visit Japan for business or study purposes, but foreign nationals who have made Japan their home and base of activities in order to make a significant contribution to Japanese society are also facing severe restrictions,"" Mikitani said in a statement this week in his capacity as chairman of the Japan Association of New Economy.
""If this stance continues into the long term, not only will Japan sacrifice new business opportunities and access to knowledge and expertise, we are also at risk of being perceived as a society that does not welcome foreign nationals within our borders.""

Earlier this week business lobbies from Europe, Britain, Australia, New Zealand and the United States signed a joint letter opposing the government's policy, saying it was out of step with measures in other major economies and would harm investment.

Investing.com – Asian stocks were down on Thursday, coming under pressure as the lack of details in the U.S. Federal Reserve’s latest minutes and simmering U.S.-China tensions damped investor sentiment.
The minutes, released on Wednesday, caused U.S. markets to pause a rally as investors digested their lack of guidance. Although the minutes stated, “with regard to the outlook for monetary policy beyond this meeting, a number of participants noted that providing greater clarity regarding the likely path of the target range for the federal funds rate would be appropriate at some point,” no further details were given.
But the pace of U.S. economic recovery is more likely to be worrying officials at present, “given the stalemate on fiscal stimulus in Washington,” Marvin Loh, senior global macro strategist at  State Street  (NYSE:STT), told Bloomberg, referring to the stalemate in the U.S. Congress over the latest stimulus measures.
“The Fed will continue to do what it can, but it does feel that fiscal is as important in the recovery process as monetary, and their tools to get funds to Main Street remain constrained,” he added.
Investors will be seeing whether the Fed will provide any further guidance at either the Jackson Hole symposium, due to take place from August 27-28, or at its next meeting in September.
The U.S. threw the latest salvo into mounting tensions with China on Wednesday, when it suspended its extradition treaty and reciprocal tax treatment agreement with Hong Kong.
The suspended agreements cover “the surrender of fugitive offenders, the transfer of sentenced persons, and reciprocal tax exemptions on income derived from the international operation of ships,” State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus said.
Other potential U.S. moves include sanctions against senior management at some of the city’s banks and further limits on the technology that Hong Kong companies can purchase from the U.S.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index slid 2.14% by 10:38 PM ET (3:38 AM GMT).

""Don't buy GOODYEAR TIRES - They announced a BAN ON MAGA HATS,"" he wrote on Twitter, referring to his slogan ""Make America Great Again"" often emblazoned on baseball caps.
""I'm not happy with Goodyear because what they're doing is playing politics,"" Trump said at a White House briefing. 
He said it was ""disgraceful"" that the company would prevent employees from wearing attire supporting the 'Blue Lives Matter' movement that supports law enforcement, while allowing support for other causes which he described as ""Marxist"" in nature.
His press secretary, Kayleigh McEnany told reporters earlier that support for police officers was just as much an equity issue as the 'Black Lives Matter' movement, citing the targeting of police officers in cities around the country.
Trump's tweet followed a news report by WIBW, a CBS affiliate television station in Kansas, about a training session at Goodyear's headquarters that discussed political attire.
Goodyear, which had nearly $15 billion in revenue last year, said a widely circulated image that triggered the controversy was not created or distributed by the company's corporate group.
The image spelled out appropriate and inappropriate displays, with 'Black Lives Matter' and 'Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender Pride' deemed acceptable, while 'Blue Lives Matter' and 'MAGA Attire' were not.
""To be clear on our longstanding corporate policy, Goodyear has zero tolerance for any form of harassment or discrimination,"" the company said in a statement. 
To enforce that policy, Goodyear said, it asks employees to avoid ""workplace expressions in support of political campaigning for any candidate or political party as well as similar forms of advocacy that fall outside the scope of racial justice and equality issues.""
Shares in Goodyear fell as much as 6% on Wednesday after the president's tweet, but later pared some of the losses to close down trade down 2.4% at $9.50, with volume at four times the 10-day moving average.
Goodyear is the largest tire company in North America. Its branded tires were on 24% of new vehicles in the United States in 2018, according to Tire Business, an industry publication. 
Democratic challenger Joe Biden said Trump's comments showed that he viewed thousands of jobs at Goodyear as ""collateral damage"" in another of his ""petty political grievances.""
U.S. Democratic Senator Sherrod Brown, who represents Goodyear's home state of Ohio, also criticized Trump's comment.
""It's absolutely despicable that the President would call for a boycott of an American company, based in Akron, that employs thousands of U.S. workers,"" he wrote in a tweet.
Trump, who is trailing Biden in opinion polls, will accept the Republican Party's presidential nomination at the White House next week after a flurry of campaign stops this week.
Trump dismissed the chance of any political or business fallout from his comments. He said he was confident that he was polling ""very well"" among Goodyear workers, adding, ""I think you'll be able to get another good job.""
The tweet caught at least three senior Trump advisers by surprise. Kellyanne Conway told reporters on Wednesday she had not seen the tweet, but did not view it as a political mistep.
""I think he's done plenty for companies in Ohio and elsewhere, far more than Joe Biden ever did,"" she said.
Boycotts, like tariffs, are a favorite in Trump's political and economic toolkit.

In early 2016, before winning the last election, Trump called for a boycott of Apple (O:AAPL) products until the tech giant agreed to U.S. government demands that it unlock the cellphone of one of the killers in an attack in California.

1089,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 19, 2020 07:55PM ET</span>",Airbnb files for IPO as short-term rental market rebounds,"By Anirban Sen and Joshua Franklin
(Reuters) - Short-term home rental company Airbnb Inc said on Wednesday it filed confidentially for an initial public offering with U.S. regulators, setting the stage for one of 2020's marquee U.S. stock market debuts.
The move underscores a rebound in parts of the travel industry, which was battered this year by restrictions and shutdowns due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
San Francisco-based Airbnb said in July that customers had booked more than 1 million nights in a single day for the first time since March 3, in part as U.S. travelers shy away from hotels and prefer to drive to local vacation rentals.
Shares of U.S. online travel agency Booking Holdings (NASDAQ:BKNG) Inc have rebounded around 14% in the past three months but are still down for the year. 
Companies can confidentially submit an IPO registration with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. If Airbnb moves forward with the IPO, the filing would be made public closer to the time of the listing.
The number of shares Airbnb will sell and the valuation it will seek have not yet been determined, Airbnb said in a statement.
Airbnb did not give a timeline for when it may complete its IPO. The company is targeting a listing before the end of the year, according to a person familiar with the matter, cautioning this is dependant on market conditions. 
The collapse of Airbnb's core home-rental business due to the COVID-19 pandemic had prompted Airbnb to suspend marketing activities for the year and cut about 25% of its workforce.
The company in April also raised $2 billion in debt from investors, which valued it at $18 billion, well below the $26 billion Airbnb cited as an internal valuation in early March.
""The company may be thinking that the lost value they've realized in 2020 could be recouped as a public company and that will be reflected in the upside in their stock price,"" said Andrea Walne, general partner at Manhattan Venture Partners, an Airbnb investor. 
Airbnb's decision to go public came as U.S. capital markets stage a stunning recovery, with the likes of online used car seller Vroom Inc and business intelligence platform ZoomInfo Technologies Inc seeing their shares surge after going public. 
""We believe that investors are willing to look beyond COVID issues and value companies based upon post-COVID scenarios. It's a constructive IPO market,"" said Kathleen Smith, principal at Renaissance Capital, a provider of institutional research and IPO ETFs
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) and  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) are lead advisers on the IPO.

(Reuters) -  Facebook Inc  (O:FB) Facebook said on Wednesday it had removed nearly 800 QAnon conspiracy groups for posts celebrating violence, showing intent to use weapons, or attracting followers with patterns of violent behavior.
The world's biggest social network, saying it was expanding its policy on perceived risks to public safety, also imposed restrictions on the remaining 1,950 public and private QAnon groups it could find. It will no longer recommend them to users and make them less likely to be discovered in searches.
Hundreds of thousands of Facebook users are known to belong to one or more QAnon groups, but Facebook declined to give more precise figures.
Facebook also removed 980 groups that it said encouraged rioting, a majority seen as generally right-wing militias but a substantial number identified as part of the leftist antifa movement. (https:// The long-anticipated takedowns come amid sustained criticism as QAnon activity has surged on Facebook this year. Twitter previously removed thousands of QAnon accounts. QAnon began in the aftermath of the false “pizzagate” conspiracy that claimed, ahead of the 2016 presidential election, that prominent Democrats were running a pedophile ring out of the basement of a Washington restaurant. It centers on anonymous postings from someone using the nickname Q who claims to be a high official in the administration of President Donald Trump. Q and his most-followed supporters idolize Trump and have asserted that Democratic and Hollywood elites worship the devil, eat children, and in some cases have already been executed after secret military tribunals and replaced by actors. A vocal QAnon supporter last week won the Republican congressional primary in a conservative Georgia district, drawing praise from Trump, who has declined to disavow the movement. Asked Wednesday about the QAnon belief that he was saving the world from satanic cannibals, Trump said: ""Is that supposed to be a bad thing? ... We are saving the world, from a radical left philosophy."" The FBI identifies QAnon as a potential source of domestic violence, and some of its followers have been charged with murder and kidnapping. Facebook has long considered some organizations to be inherently dangerous and banned them, and some critics had urged the company to do the same with QAnon. ""Taking down groups and pages, restricting others, and banning hashtags is a step, but an insufficient one,"" said Cindy Otis, a former CIA analyst with a new book on misinformation. 
A Facebook spokeswoman acknowledged that QAnon followers would start new groups with new code words, and that the attempt to restrain them would be an ongoing battle.

1091,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 19, 2020 06:30PM ET</span>","L Brands reports surprise profit on demand for soaps, lingerie","(Reuters) - L Brands Inc (N:LB) on Wednesday reported a surprise quarterly profit boosted by strong demand for Bath & Body Works' sanitizers and soaps, as well as higher online sales of Victoria's Secret lingerie during coronavirus-led lockdowns.
The pandemic-fuelled temporary store closures, which have pushed many retailers into bankruptcy, led to 850 jobs cuts at L Brand's home office and permanent closing of some Victoria's Secret stores, after a stake sale in the unit fell apart.
The company's direct channel, which includes its online store that remained open throughout the quarter, proved to be a bright spot as customers flocked to shop virtually.
That helped comparable sales for Bath & Body Works surge 123%, while that for Victoria's Secret rise 28%.
Overall comparable sales rose 63% for L Brands, crushing the average analyst estimate of an 18% fall, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
""Q2 2020 was much stronger than expected... The key question for management will be whether the company will be able to maintain this strength through holiday,"" Bernstein analyst Jamie Merriman said.
With the busy holiday season soon approaching, L Brands said it was testing ideas to spread its holiday merchandise to a broader time period, and to introduce some merchandise into the current quarter.
It also forecast ""meaningful expense pressure"" due to higher store costs that include payroll and supplies, due to social distancing protocols, wage rate inflation and higher shipping costs. 
Excluding one-time items, the company earned 25 cents per share in the quarter ended Aug. 1, compared with the expectation of a 42 cents loss. 
Net sales fell about 20% to $2.32 billion, but were above Wall Street estimates of $2.21 billion. 
Shares of the Columbus, Ohio-based company were up 4% in extended trading.

""Well he's said that,"" Kudlow told CNBC when asked about Trump's demand that part of the proceeds from the TikTok sale he has ordered go to the U.S. Treasury. 
""I acknowledge that it's unusual. The president has his own mind on some of these things,"" Kudlow said. 
""I don't know whether that will end up being the case when the Treasury gets its bids in from potential bidders. But the president has said that. I think he probably would like to deny China some of the proceeds of the TikTok sale,"" Kudlow added.
Trump ordered ByteDance last week to divest TikTok's U.S. operations within 90 days, the latest effort to ramp up pressure on the Chinese company over concerns about the safety of the personal data it handles.
Trump has said he would support an effort by  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) to buy TikTok's American operations if the U.S. government gets a ""substantial portion"" of the proceeds, but has also said there are other interested potential buyers.

1096,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 19, 2020 05:09PM ET</span>","U.S. Ends Three Pacts With Hong Kong on Extradition, Taxes","(Bloomberg) -- The U.S. announced it is suspending its extradition treaty with Hong Kong and ending reciprocal tax treatment with the former British colony, the latest salvo in escalating tensions between Washington and Beijing.
The moves are part of the Trump administration’s efforts to pressure China over the imposition of a national security law that curtailed many of Hong Kong’s freedoms. They follow up on an executive order to end preferential trading treatment for the city, which President Donald Trump and his team say is now essentially just another Chinese city.
The agreements terminated on Wednesday “covered the surrender of fugitive offenders, the transfer of sentenced persons, and reciprocal tax exemptions on income derived from the international operation of ships,” State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus said.
“These steps underscore our deep concern regarding Beijing’s decision to impose the National Security Law, which has crushed the freedoms of the people of Hong Kong,” Ortagus added.
The moves strip away some of the few remaining ways in which the U.S. treated Hong Kong differently from the rest of China as part of Beijing’s “One Country, Two Systems” policy. Earlier in August, the U.S. imposed sanctions on Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam and other top officials.
Other moves may still be coming, possibly including sanctions against senior staff at some of Hong Kong’s biggest banks. The U.S. may also impose further limits on the sorts of technology that Hong Kong companies can buy from the U.S. Earlier, some administration officials had studied ways to undermine the Hong Kong dollar’s peg against the U.S. dollar, but backed off that idea for fear it would rebound and hurt the U.S. economy.

1097,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 19, 2020 04:41PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: 3 Things to Watch for August 20,"By Liz Moyer
Investing.com -- Stocks pushed ahead to record highs earlier Wednesday until minutes of the latest Fed meeting sucked the life out of the party.
While consumer spending rebounded strongly from the worst of the Covid-19 lockdowns this spring, the Fed acknowledged that businesses faced an uncertain outlook that could affect the pace of the recovery.
The S&P 500 surged above its previous intraday high, a day after closing at a record, but fell back after the Fed minutes were released. The broad market ended the day down 0.4%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.3% and NASDAQ Composite dropped 0.5%.
Retail earnings continue on Thursday with reports due out from BJ's Wholesale and Ross Stores. Apple became the first publicly traded American company to reach $2 trillion in market value ahead of its 4-for-1 stock split, and gold fell back below $2,000.
Here are three things that could affect the markets tomorrow.
1. More earnings reports from retailers
Analysts expect the warehouse chain BJ's Wholesale Club Holdings Inc (NYSE:BJ) to report profit of 57 cents a share on revenue of $3.7 billion, according to a survey by Investing.com.  Ross Stores Inc  (NASDAQ:ROST) is expected to report a loss of 28 cents a share on sales of $2.4 billion.
Retailers had mixed results on Wednesday.  Target  Corporation (NYSE:TGT) jumped after reporting its strongest second quarter ever, with profit soaring 80%, handily beating expectations. The home supply chain Lowe’s Companies Inc (NYSE:LOW) also had a strong quarter, beating expectations, though its stock did not react as favorably.
Meanwhile, TJX Companies Inc (NYSE:TJX) the parent of TJ Maxx and Marshall's discount stores, reported a worse-than-expected quarter.
2. Will Apple maintain its upward momentum?
Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) reached above a $2 trillion market cap briefly on Wednesday, the cherry on top of a remarkable 57% climb this year even with the pandemic.
It took the maker of iPhones and Mac laptops just two years to achieve what no other publicly-traded American company has. And it did so in a matter of months, roaring back from a 2020 low in March.
The pandemic made people more reliant than ever on their gadgets during lockdowns. And a plan to split the $462 stock 4-for-1 later this month may draw in new investors, pushing the stock even higher.
But the split isn't great news for the Dow index, which unlike other stock indexes, is weighted according to price. Right now, Apple is the most expensive of the 30 Dow components, meaning it has the most influence in the direction of the Dow. But after the split, which will result in a stock at roughly $115, Apple will be ranked below several others, including  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Walmart Inc (NYSE:WMT).
3. Gold and the dollar act funny after Fed minutes
Gold Futures sank again on Wednesday as the dollar surged, seemingly in defiance of the Fed's comments on the economic recovery.
After soaring above $2,000 on Tuesday, the yellow metal dropped back to around $1,950, and the dollar surged 1% against other world currencies. The gain in the dollar, which has been under pressure in recent weeks, perplexed traders. The minutes of the Federal Reserve's July meeting spelled out some concerns about the progress of the recovery, especially since businesses are still struggling to come back.
The risks include the possibility of a new wave of virus spread that could cause credit markets to tighten again. Loss of pandemic support for households, businesses and local governments is also an issue, the Fed said. The minutes represent the Federal Open Market Committee's deliberations from the late-July policy meeting, when policymakers opted to keep rates near zero.

(Reuters) - Chipmaker  Analog Devices  Inc (O:ADI) on Wednesday forecasted fiscal fourth quarter revenue above analysts' prior expectations despite an anticipated slowdown in sales of chips for 5G networks.
ADI forecast fiscal fourth-quarter revenue of $1.44 billion, plus or minus 10%, and adjusted earnings per share of $1.32 per share, plus or minus 10 cents. Both forecasts beat analyst expectations of $1.41 billion in revenue and adjusted earnings per share of $1.24, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
The Massachusetts company makes a variety of chips that go into 5G networking gear. ADI said it expects sales to a company believed to be Huawei Technologies Co Ltd to drop to zero in the current fiscal fourth quarter because of new rules issued by U.S. government officials.
On a conference call with investors, however, ADI's Chief Financial Officer Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah said the 5G chip slowdown stemmed from ""normal operating lumpiness of the communications business"" in which carriers buy up chips and deploy equipment in spurts and was unrelated to Huawei.
ADI Chief Executive Vincent Roche told Reuters in an interview that revenue from ""a formerly large Chinese customer"" had dropped into the ""very low single"" digits as a percentage of ADI's revenue in recent quarters and was expected to drop to zero.
Roche said that the new rules issued Monday mean that any U.S. chip company, or any non-U.S. chip company using U.S. technology to create chips, can no longer sell to the Chinese company, which ADI officials have not named but analysts say is Huawei.
""We support all our customers with great equality, but we stay on the right side of the regulations,"" Roche said.
The new rules allow companies to apply for licenses to sell to Huawei. Roche said the company intends to seek those licenses for its formerly large Chinese customer.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 closed lower after hitting an intraday high on Wednesday as tech gave up its gains following the release of the Fed minutes warning that impact of the pandemic continued to weigh on the economy despite signs of recovery.   
The S&P 500 fell 0.39% to close at 3,376, after surging above its previous all-time intraday of 3,393.52 earlier in the session. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.31%, or 16 points. while the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.57%.
In the Fed's July meeting minutes, policymakers acknowledged a strong rebound in consumer spending, but flagged ongoing uncertainty among businesses, which could likely pressure the robust recovery seen in labor markets.  
""In contrast to the sizable rebound in consumer spending, participants saw less improvement in the business sector in recent months, and they noted that their District business contacts continued to report extraordinarily high levels of uncertainty and risks, "" the minutes showed.
Still, Fed members continued to suggest that accommodative policy should continue amid sluggish inflation. ""Participants also noted that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy would likely be needed for some time to support aggregate demand and achieve 2 percent inflation over the longer run.""
The update comes as the latest wave of quarterly results show that retailers like  Target  (NYSE:TGT) and Lowe’s Companies Inc (NYSE:LOW) benefited from a pandemic-led boost in sales. 
Target jumped nearly 13% reported that second-quarter results beat on both the top and bottom lines with same-store sales growing 24.3% for the quarter, above consensus estimates of 7.6%. 
Lowe’s shares gained 0.25% as the home-improvement retailer delivered earnings and revenue that topped expectations. 
Industrials and financials, sectors that tend to outperform as the economy strengthens, also faltered late-on as the Fed warned that the impact of the virus would ""weigh heavily on economic activity."" 
In tech, meanwhile, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) became the first company to reach a $2 trillion valuation after trading above $467.77 intraday before giving back some gains.
The other Fab 5 stocks, including Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) closed lower. Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) closed above the flatline. 
Energy was pressured by a decline in oil prices as crude inventories declined by 1.6 million barrels last week, short of forecasts for a draw of 2.67 million barrels.

1102,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 19, 2020 04:00PM ET</span>",School Chain Backed by Brazil's Richest Man Plans IPO This Year,"(Bloomberg) -- Brazilian K-12 school chain Eleva Educação SA, which counts Brazil’s richest man as an investor, is planning an initial public offering, according to people with knowledge of the matter.
The Rio de Janeiro-based company is weighing a listing in Brazil or the U.S. and has asked investment banks to pitch for a role in the offering, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the information is private. The transaction would raise about 1.5 billion reais ($272 million), according to one of the people.
Billionaire Jorge Paulo Lemann, a founding partner of 3G Capital, owns a stake in Eleva through another firm. Eleva’s investors also include U.S. private equity firm Warburg Pincus LLC, which acquired a minority stake in 2017.
The transaction would take place later this year, the people said. The discussions are ongoing and the company’s plans could still change, they said.
A representative for Eleva didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.
Founded in 2013, Eleva owns about 130 schools with 80,000 students spread across 11 Brazilian states, according to its website. The company also has a proprietary learning system used by more than 100,000 students in partner schools.
Brazilian companies raised 25.5 billion reais in IPOs over the past year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The list includes Vasta Platform Ltd, which sells learning systems to K-12 private schools, and priced its initial public offering above the proposed target range, raising about $353 million in a Nasdaq listing in July.

1103,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 19, 2020 03:00PM ET</span>",Boeing scores year's first 737 MAX order with Polish airline Enter Air,"By Ankit Ajmera and Sanjana Shivdas
(Reuters) -  Boeing Co  (N:BA) won its first order for the grounded 737 MAX aircraft this year, after Poland's  Enter Air SA  (WA:ENTP) agreed to buy up to four variants of the jet, the U.S. planemaker said on Wednesday.
The jet's recertification is still hanging in the balance more than a year after its worldwide grounding due to two fatal crashes, and the planemaker's woes have been compounded by the coronavirus crisis hitting air travel.
Boeing's customers have canceled more than 400 orders for the 737 MAX jets this year, the company said last week. Based on a tighter accounting standard, the 737 MAX order cancellations and conversions to other aircraft models now stand at 864.
The planemaker said on Wednesday that Enter Air placed a new order for two 737-8 aircraft with options for two more jets. When the purchase agreement is fully exercised, Enter Air's 737 MAX fleet will rise to 10 aircraft, Boeing said.
""Although it is significant because it's the first MAX order since December 2019, it's a small order ... (Enter Air) likely got a significant discount,"" S&P Global Ratings analyst Chris DeNicolo said.
Enter Air said it had reached a deal with Boeing to address the impact from the 737 MAX groundings, and would defer the deliveries of previously ordered MAX airplanes following weak air travel demand.
""Following the rigorous checks that the 737 MAX is undergoing, I am convinced it will be the best aircraft in the world for many years to come,"" Enter Air board member Grzegorz Polaniecki said.
The carrier took deliveries of two 737 MAX planes in 2018 and currently has four unfilled orders for the jet.

Boeing's shares were up about 1% at $171.60.

1104,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 19, 2020 02:45PM ET</span>",Wall Street Underestimates U.S. Consumers and Their Wallets,"(Bloomberg) -- The American consumer is proving more resilient than predicted.
Conventional wisdom, which initially assumed many U.S. shoppers would save their paychecks and stimulus funds until the pandemic subsided, has proved unfounded. The largest American retailers all reported sales in the latest quarter that blew away expectations.
From Wall Street to the retailers themselves to the manufacturers that supply them, it seemed no one was ready for just how brisk demand would be from a consumer base stuck inside with nowhere to go.
Home-improvement chains  Home Depot  Inc (NYSE:HD). and Lowe’s Cos., everything stores Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc. and  Target  Corp. (NYSE:TGT), and of course online behemoth Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN). each beat analysts’ sales forecasts in the summer quarter -- and by billions of dollars apiece. Companies that have been able to pivot quickly to more online sales or already had established apps for curbside pickup have done particularly well, plus those that cater to a bored American shopper looking to spend.
The “fatal flaw” of economists was assuming that people will always keep their wallets closed during tough times, leading to miscalculations about consumer demand, said Doug Stephens, founder of Retail Prophet.
The recent spate of robust retail earnings have shown the power of consumer resiliency and adaptability. They also reinforce the staggering unpredictability of pandemic times.
Going forward, this past quarter raises doubts about how seriously to take anyone claiming to have a read on America’s shopping habits, especially as Congress remains stalemated over additional stimulus and millions still out of work.
Big Six
Craig Johnson, president of Customer Growth Partners, says the “big six” retailers seeing record growth -- Walmart, Amazon, Home Depot, Target, Lowe’s, and Costco Wholesale Corp (NASDAQ:COST), which hasn’t yet reported -- all share some common traits. They have consistent traffic growth, rising store productivity, improved online platforms, a mix of discretionary and non-discretionary items and a clear understanding of their customers’ needs and preferences.
“On a dollar basis, households are sitting on $3.4 trillion in savings, up $2.2 trillion from last June, indicating that consumers still have a lot of dry powder waiting to spend,” he said in an email. “Retail sales are also bolstered by the steep decline in spending on travel, entertainment and restaurants.”
Lowe’s Chief Executive Officer Marvin Ellison has certainly witnessed that trend. As his company reported same-store sales in the U.S. at a blistering 35.1% rate, he says he’s seeing a behavior change in consumers.
“It’s a shift away from vacations, it’s a shift away from dining out. It’s a shift away from apparel purchases. It’s those dollars that you may have invested in those things that now you’re spending on your home and in some cases out of necessity like trying to create a more functional environment,” he said in an interview.
The government’s retail sales data underscore this adjustment. Sales at non-store retailers, building materials outlets and auto dealers account for greater shares of total retail purchases than they did in February, before the pandemic, while restaurants and clothing merchants represent less.
Ellison’s even changing how he views his own home space. His daughter is an incoming college freshman, whose first few weeks of college will consist of remote learning, so Ellison had to set up a makeshift classroom so she can work productively.
“Are we also seeing discretionary spend? Sure. We are also seeing people get new furniture, upgraded appliances and we’re seeing other things like new kitchens, new bathrooms,” he said. “What was catching everyone by surprise was that all of us were spending more time at home than we ever have in our lives. We’re simply finding more things to do to make our homes more functional.”
Another potential sign that consumer spending fared better than most feared: Even small businesses have been surprisingly resilient so far, avoiding the surge in permanent closings that many expected at the start of the Covid-19 crisis.
Industry Losers
Those retailers who haven’t fared as well are the ones closely linked to the American shopping mall, especially department stores and retailers focused on apparel. TJX (NYSE:TJX) Cos., the owner of the T.J. Maxx and Marshalls chains, fell the most in more than four months Wednesday after predicting that sales at opened stores will drop as much as 20% in the current quarter, while Kohl’s Corp. on Tuesday plummeted as it became clear the business struggled to regain sales as shoppers stay home or flock to e-commerce.
The question is whether these elevated sales last after federal stimulus checks come to an end. A consumer survey from analysts at Stifel found that three out of four Americans have already spent a chunk of their stimulus checks, and Walmart warned this week the effect was already apparent. Target CEO Brian Cornell said he hopes there is a second round of federal stimulus to put more money in consumers’ pockets.
“The ending of enhanced benefits is undoubtedly a negative as it will deprive many households of the extra cash they were spending on the home,” Neil Saunders, Managing Director of GlobalData Retail, said in an email. “However, from our data it is still clear that home remains a big priority for most consumers and spending cuts are more likely to be focused on categories such as apparel. It is also true that by spending less on things like travel, gasoline, and eating out,” households have more money banked for other outlays, like improving their homes.
“Analysis of the pandemic usually involves talking about retail casualties,” he added. “However, as these results show, the crisis has created success as well as failures.”

Investing.com – The S&P 500 retracted from record highs, as tech ran out of steam following the release of the Fed minutes showing that pockets of the economy continue to remain under pressure,   
The S&P 500 was flat at 3,387, after surging above its previous all-time intraday of 3,393.52 earlier in the session. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.06%, or 16 points. while the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.21%.
In the Fed's July meeting minutes, policymakers acknowledged a strong rebound in consumer spending, though flagged ongoing uncertainty among businesses, which could likely pressure the robust recovery seen in labor markets.  
""In contrast to the sizable rebound in consumer spending, participants saw less improvement in the business sector in recent months, and they noted that their District business contacts continued to report extraordinarily high levels of uncertainty and risks, "" the minutes showed.
Still, policymakers continued to suggest that accommodative policy should continue amid sluggish inflation. ""Participants also noted that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy would likely be needed for some time to support aggregate demand and achieve 2 percent inflation over the longer run.""
The update comes as the last wave of quarterly results show that retailers like  Target  (NYSE:TGT) and Lowe’s Companies Inc (NYSE:LOW) benefited from a pandemic-led boost in sales. 
Target jumped 12% reported that second-quarter results beat on both the top and bottom lines with same-store sales growing 24.3% for the quarter, above consensus estimates of 7.6%. 
Lowe’s shares gained 0.6% as the home-improvement retailer delivered earnings and revenue that topped expectations. 
Industrials and financials, sectors that tend to outperform as the economy strengthens, also led the charge higher in the broader market as investors continue to bet on a faster economic recovery. 
In tech, meanwhile, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) became the first company to reach a $2 trillion valuation after gaining 1% to trade above $467.73.
The other Fab 5 stocks, with the exception of Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), were higher. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) traded above the flatline. 
Energy, however, struggled to join in the move higher, pressured by decline in oil prices as crude inventories declined by 1.6 million barrels last week, short of forecasts for a draw of 2.67 million barrels. 
In other news, Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ:GILD) was dealt a blow after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration rejected the company’s experimental treatment for moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis. Its shares fell 4%.

(Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson agreed to buy Momenta Pharmaceuticals Inc for about $6.5 billion on Wednesday, to bolster its portfolio of drugs for hard-to-treat autoimmune diseases.
The acquisition, latest in a recent spate of healthcare deals, comes just days after France's  Sanofi  (NASDAQ:SNY) struck a $3.7 billion deal to buy  Principia Biopharma  (NASDAQ:PRNB) Inc for its pipeline of autoimmune disease treatments.
Treatments targeting autoimmune conditions have fetched billions of dollars in sales, including  AbbVie Inc  (NYSE:ABBV)'s Humira, which is the world's best selling drug. 
J&J's Janssen unit will gain access to Momenta's experimental therapy, nipocalimab, which is in late-stage testing for warm antibody hemolytic anemia, a condition that causes destruction of healthy red blood cells, and mid-stage testing for myasthenia gravis, a neuromuscular disease.
Nipocalimab is expected to eventually win approval to treat several conditions, ""many as first-in-class indications with potential for significant peak year sales, some of which could exceed $1 billion,"" J&J said in a statement. 
""We find the deal modestly surprising as we see every one of Momenta's assets as somewhat tricky to develop,"" said BTIG analyst Thomas Shrader. 
Shares of Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Momenta were up 69.2% at $52.15, just a hair's breadth away from the offer price of $52.50.
With the recent flurry of activity, the pharmaceutical and biotech sectors have seen 829 deals so far this year, compared with 839 by this time in 2019, according to data from Refinitiv. 
The value of the deals, however, is much lower this year - $62 billion versus $290 billion a year ago.

J&J in recent years has sold some businesses such as the one that made medical devices for diabetes care, as it sharpens focus on better-performing products such as cancer treatments.

Investing.com --  BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc (NASDAQ:BMRN) slumped more than 36% on Wednesday after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration rejected its gene therapy for hemophilia A. 
It's not the end of the world for the drug, though. The FDA cited the need for longer-term data, which could push approval -- if it comes at all -- to 2022.  
All signs pointed to approval this month after clinic trials showed it reduced the bleeding rate of patients with the disorder, decreasing or eliminating the need for treatment, Reuters reported. 
The market for the drug is not especially large. There are about 16,000 patients in the U.S. with hemophilia A in which they are missing the factor VIII clotting protein. The gene therapy would allow them to forego standard therapy requiring patients to infuse factor proteins into their bloodstreams several times a week for life, costing hundreds of thousands of dollars a year, according to Reuters.  
BioMarin had said the gene therapy could be priced in a range of $1 million to $3 million, making it the most expensive one-time treatment, Reuters said.

1113,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 19, 2020 11:36AM ET</span>","U.S. Payrolls Count Falls by 173,000 in Year Through March","(Bloomberg) -- U.S. job growth was probably less robust in the year through March, a Bureau of Labor Statistics spokesperson said.
The number of workers added to payrolls will probably be revised down by 173,000 during the period, a Labor Department spokesperson said by phone Wednesday. That would be a downward revision of about 14,400 on a monthly basis. The data were due for release on the BLS’s website at 10 a.m. in Washington, but weren’t immediately available.
The revisions cover a wide-reaching period, encapsulating both job gains from the record-long economic expansion that ended in February and the first wave of what would ultimately be millions of job losses related to Covid-19 and the recession it spurred.
The Bureau of Labor Statistics data currently show nonfarm payroll employment increased by an average of 73,000 a month in the year through March 2020, dragged down by a 1.37 million decline in March as states ordered or encouraged Americans to stay home to combat the spread of the virus. The decline was a dramatic shift from the jobs market heading into the pandemic, where employers were adding around 200,000 people to payrolls each month and companies complained about the challenges of finding enough qualified workers.
The data showed a 144,400 upward revision in transportation and warehousing, which helped offset a 125,000 downward revision in professional and business services and a 118,000 downward revision in education and health services.
The final annual benchmark revisions to payrolls will be issued with the January employment data released in February 2021. The Labor Department uses records from state jobless benefit tax records to benchmark its employment data.

A study shows the under-34 crowd has increased its trading during the pandemic at a rate far higher than that of the broader population.
More than half of Gen Z and Millennial investors said they’ve been trading more often since the Covid-19 pandemic began, compared with just a 30% increase for the general population, according to a quarterly survey conducted in early July and released by E*Trade Financial (NASDAQ:ETFC) Corp. on Wednesday. At the same time, 46% of younger investors said they’ve traded derivatives more frequently, double the average rate.
“Access to the market has never been easier,” said Chris Larkin, managing director of trading and investment product at E*Trade. The study sampled 873 self-directed investors who have at least $10,000 in an online brokerage account.
Retail investors have grown into an undeniable force this year, driven to stock-trading by zero fees and boredom with little else to do during the pandemic. Individual investors now account for 20% of equity trading, according to an analysis by Bloomberg Intelligence’s Larry Tabb, making them the second-largest group of investors in the market.
The influence these small fry have on security prices is debatable, but Wall Street has been captivated by the outlandish nature of some of their most prominent and daring trades -- from airlines and cruiselines hit hard by Covid-19 to bankruptcy stocks including Hertz Global Holdings (NYSE:HTZ) Inc.
According to the E*Trade survey, 51% of Gen Z and Millennial respondents said their risk tolerance has increased since the coronavirus outbreak -- compared to 28% for the total population. The younger generations have also been deploying cash into new trades at a rate that’s almost twice as high as the broader investing base.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Departing World Trade Organization Director General Roberto Azevedo will join PepsiCo Inc (O:PEP) as chief corporate affairs officer, the soft drink and snack foods giant said on Wednesday as the WTO remains far from deciding on a successor.
PepsiCo said in a statement that Azevedo will oversee its public policy, government affairs and communications efforts in a newly created role that works with governments, international organizations and other stakeholders. He will also join PepsiCo's executive committee.
""We are thrilled to welcome Roberto, who brings valuable political skills and technical knowledge of the complex social, political, and regulatory environments impacting multinational corporations like PepsiCo,"" PepsiCo Chairman Ramon Laguarta said in a statement, adding that Azevedo's ""geopolitical insights will be invaluable to our discussions and decision-making in an ever-changing world."" 
Azevedo, a Brazilian former trade negotiator and diplomat, has headed the WTO since 2013. He is due to leave the organization at the end of August, but the eight candidates vying to succeed him have been given until Sept. 7 to campaign for the job and the selection process is expected to drag into November.
The deeply divided organization failed at the end of July to appoint an interim chief among four deputies.
The next WTO chief would broker international trade talks amid worsening economic tensions between the United States and China, increased protectionism sparked by the coronavirus pandemic and pressure to reform global trading rules..
U.S. President Donald Trump's administration has effectively shut down the WTO's Appellate Body, which issues final settlements for trade disputes, by blocking judicial appointments.

Azevedo said in a statement he was ""delighted"" to join PepsiCo, calling the maker of Pepsi and Doritos ""a global leader in driving meaningful collaborations and investments focused on the betterment of our society and planet.""

Apple reached $467.77 a share in morning trading, pushing the company above $2 trillion in market capitalization. 
The valuation of the company has doubled in about two years, and the stock has more than doubled in the past year and is heading for a split. The company said last month that its board of directors approved a four-for-one stock split, meaning that for each share of Apple stock that an investor owns, they’ll receive three additional shares.
The shares will also become more affordable for investors. It is the fifth split since 1987. The most recent move was made in 2014, when it offered a seven-to-one split, CNBC reported. 
Apple reported strong third quarter results in July with earnings per share of $2.58 compared to the estimated $2.05 on sales of $59.69 billion, which compared to the expected $52.29 billion, according to analysts tracked by Investing.com. Results have beaten forecasts in the past nine quarters.

1117,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 19, 2020 11:25AM ET</span>","Exclusive: Facebook employees internally question policy after India content controversy - sources, memos","By Aditya Kalra and Munsif Vengattil
NEW DELHI/BENGALURU (Reuters) - Facebook (O:FB) and its top lobbying executive in India, Ankhi Das, are facing questions internally from employees over how political content is regulated in its biggest market, according to sources with direct knowledge and internal posts seen by Reuters.
The world's largest social network is battling a public-relations and political crisis in India after the Wall Street Journal reported that Das opposed applying the company's hate-speech rules to a politician from Prime Minister Narendra Modi's party who had in posts called Muslims traitors.
In the United States and around the world, Facebook employees are raising questions about whether adequate procedures and content regulation practices were being followed by the India team, sources familiar with discussions told Reuters.
An open letter written to Facebook's leadership by 11 employees on one internal platform, and seen by Reuters, demands company leaders acknowledge and denounce ""anti-Muslim bigotry"" and ensure more policy consistency. 
The letter also demanded that Facebook's ""policy team in India (and elsewhere) includes diverse representation."" 
""It is hard not to feel frustrated and saddened by the incidents reported ... We know we're not alone in this. Employees across the company are expressing similar sentiment,"" said the letter. ""The Muslim community at Facebook would like to hear from Facebook leadership on our asks.""
Facebook and Das did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Facebook has been under fire in recent years for its lax approach to fake news content, state-backed disinformation campaigns and violent content spread via its platforms.
The WSJ article said Das had told staff that applying hate-speech rules to politicians close to Modi's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) ""would damage the company's business prospects in the country.""
Following the report, in response to Reuters queries on the matter, Facebook said it prohibits hate speech that incites violence and enforces policies without regard to political position or party affiliation.
""While we know there is more to do, we're making progress on enforcement and conduct regular audits,"" said the company, which has more than 300 million users in India. 
One of the sources said Facebook's India leadership will have to answer tough questions on what really happened, ""There will be scrutiny on what really went down.""
A second source familiar with the reactions said Facebook employees were discussing whether there should be strict separation between government relations and content policy teams, and there is ""an internal debate happening about the (content moderation) processes.""
After the article, Facebook India head Ajit Mohan defended Das, whose title is Director, Public Policy, India, South & Central Asia, and the company's policies in an internal community post, also seen by Reuters.
The WSJ ""article does not reflect the person I know or the extraordinarily complex issues we face everyday that benefits from Ankhi and the Public Policy team's expertise,"" Mohan wrote.
Mohan also wrote the company is ""confident that the article's claim that political affiliations influence decision making in India is inaccurate and without merit.""
A spokesman for the WSJ did not respond to a request for comment.
India's opposition Congress Party has called for a parliamentary probe into Facebook, while BJP lawmakers in turn have accused Facebook of censoring nationalist voices.
Das, 49, is considered among India's most influential corporate lobbying executives and has been central to Facebook's rise in India since joining the company in 2011. 
""She has created a niche for herself (in India),"" said a person who has worked closely with Das on policy issues. 
One former Facebook executive in Asia and a former Indian government official described Das as very sharp and politically connected. A second former employee said Das has always been outspoken about issues in the company.
Das hasn't commented on the controversy, but her sister Rashmi, who has publicly acknowledged her own ties to a student wing close to the BJP, told the India Today TV on Tuesday, ""we sisters are made of very stern stuff.""

""I'm sure Ankhi will handle it very competently,"" she said.

1119,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 19, 2020 10:40AM ET</span>","U.S. FDA rejects BioMarin hemophilia A gene therapy, shares dive","By Caroline Humer
(Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration rejected BioMarin Pharmaceutical (NASDAQ:BMRN) Inc's gene therapy for bleeding disorder hemophilia A citing the need for longer-term data, the drugmaker said on Wednesday, potentially pushing any approval out to 2022.
BioMarin shares fell 31%, or $37, to $81.54 in morning trading.
The company, Wall Street, and doctors had expected the therapy to be approved this month after it had shown in clinical trials that it reduced the bleeding rate of patients with the disorder, decreasing or eliminating the need for treatment.
There are about 16,000 patients in the United States with hemophilia A in which they are missing the factor VIII clotting protein. The standard therapy requires patients to infuse factor proteins into their bloodstream several times a week for life, costing hundreds of thousands of dollars a year. It was hoped the gene therapy would enable patients to forego or reduce those infusions.
BioMarin had said the gene therapy could be priced in a range of $1 million to $3 million, potentially making it the most expensive one-time treatment in the United States. Novartis AG's spinal muscular atrophy gene therapy is priced at $2.1 million.
The company said on Wednesday that the FDA had changed its requirements for data in its application, asking for the complete two-year data from an ongoing late-stage study of the therapy.
It received the request in a complete response letter from the agency, which was due to respond to the company this week about its application.
""We are surprised and disappointed that the FDA introduced new expectations for the first time in the Complete Response Letter,"" Chief Executive Officer Jean-Jacques Bienaimé said in a statement.
BioMarin submitted its application based on three-year phase 1/2 data and interim analysis of the phase 3 data. The phase 1/2 data had shown that the effects of the treatment declined in the second year and continued to decline but more slowly in years three and four. The treatment aims to enable patients with hemophilia A to make the blood-clotting protein they otherwise lack.
The FDA told BioMarin that the differences between the trials limited its ability to rely on the phase 1/2 data in its analysis of how long the treatment would be effective.
The late-stage trial completed enrollment in November of 2019, making the data available for a re-filing in late 2021, and approval one year after that, Stifel analyst Paul Matteis said in a research note.
The FDA did not have an immediate comment.
The FDA's rejection narrows the lead BioMarin's valoctocogene roxaparvovec, or ValRox, had on potential rival treatments from Roche Holdings AG and  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) Inc/Sangamo Therapeutics Inc. Pfizer and Sangamo are due to start phase 3 this year while Roche is not due to start its trial until next year.
It may benefit Roche's bispecific antibody Hemlibra that mimics the function of a missing blood clotting protein to restore the clotting process. It is expected to have sales of $2 billion this year.

(Reuters) -  Target  Corp (N:TGT) on Wednesday reported its best quarterly comparable sales growth and online revenue that nearly tripled as customers took advantage of the retailer's quick and contact-free delivery to shop for clothes, videogames and home decor.
Shares of the Minneapolis-based retailer jumped around 12% to a record high of $153.77 in morning trading after it handily trounced estimates for quarterly profit and revenue.
The surging demand seen at big-box chains at the height of the lockdown caused by the coronavirus pandemic has continued into the second quarter even as restrictions ease, with some U.S. shoppers using their stimulus checks to shop for bigger-ticket non-essentials, such as tablets and beauty products.
""The biggest change we saw from Q1 to Q2 ... was the exceptional growth we saw in in-store shopping in an environment where many Americans were turning to digital to fulfill their needs,"" Chief Executive Officer Brian Cornell told reporters.
While foot traffic at Target stores rose 4.6%, Walmart said on Tuesday it saw a 14% decline.
On the whole, shoppers are also generally shopping less frequently but purchasing more in one trip to the store.
""Target's digital offer is working in tandem with their fleet of 1,900 stores and shows that the multichannel mojo is a strategic positive in the battle vs. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Walmart,"" Evercore analyst Greg Melich said.
In the second quarter ended on Aug. 1, Target's apparel sales grew by double-digits after a 20% first-quarter drop, with electronics sales up more than 70%.
The retailer also echoed bigger rival Walmart (N:WMT) as well as department store chain Kohl's Corp (N:KSS) in describing the start to the back-to-school season as slow because of uncertainty around when students would go back to classrooms. In response, it will extend back-to-school offerings, it said.
Cornell added that even as the effect of government support has waned, sales remained strong in June and July with August off to a ""solid start,"" recording low double-digit growth.
""As we move into Q4 we can expect a hard-fought election and a holiday season that, like so much of this year, is likely to be unprecedented,"" Cornell said.
Through the pandemic-ridden first half of the year in which numerous bankruptcies occurred among traditional brick-and-mortar retailers including J.C. Penney and Neiman Marcus, Target said it won about $5 billion in market share across categories.
The group's comparable sales, which include online and store sales, jumped 24.3% in the quarter, handily beating expectations of a 8.2% increase, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Comparable digital sales surged 195%, driven largely by the success of Target's same-day services, such as in-store pick up, Drive up and Shipt, which grew 273% in the quarter.
""Target's Q2 performance obliterated the bullseye, with every line item vastly exceeding our expectations,"" Moody's (NYSE:MCO) retail analyst Charlie O'Shea said.
Target said that nearly 90% of its online orders were fulfilled through stores, another sign investments in swifter delivery and remodeling stores were paying off.

Target's net earnings jumped 80.3% to $1.69 billion, with adjusted earnings per share of $3.38, well ahead of analysts' $1.62 forecast. Total revenue rose about 25% to $22.98 billion, also topping expectations of $20.87 billion.

In return for job guarantees until at least March 31, 2021, pilots union Vereinigung Cockpit (VC) has agreed to reduced top-up payments to short-time working benefits as well as cuts to pension benefits through to the end of 2020, Lufthansa said.
Lufthansa added it would only be able to avoid redundancies beyond March if it reached a long-term agreement for pilots, including a corresponding cut in working hours and salaries. Lufthansa employs around 5,000 pilots.
It added that wage increases previously negotiated for this year would be postponed until January 2021.
The VC union said the short-term agreement gave the two sides time to work on a longer-term deal.
""We clearly reject Lufthansa's threat to make redundancies for operational reasons. In our opinion, a social partnership must show how resilient it is, especially in bad times,"" VC President Markus Wahl said in a statement.
Last week, the airline put German workers on notice of compulsory layoffs, saying the slump in travel and slow progress in union negotiations meant cuts were unavoidable after the carrier lost 1.7 billion euros in a single quarter.
Lufthansa, which in June received a 9 billion euro government bailout to secure its future, said last week it expected capacity to recover to only around 50% of normal by the end of 2020 and to two thirds of last year's level in 2021.

Cabin crew voted in favour of a deal to stop pay rises and cut hours, the UFO trade union said on Saturday, while Lufthansa said on Thursday it had walked away from talks with union Verdi on behalf of 35,000 ground staff over a package to cut costs.

1124,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 19, 2020 10:00AM ET</span>",Biggest Oil Fund and Its CEO Face Impending SEC Action,"(Bloomberg) -- The world’s biggest exchange-traded fund tracking oil is facing U.S. regulatory action after it took a series of extreme steps to survive the historic crude selloff earlier this year.
The Securities and Exchange Commission has issued the United States Oil Fund (NYSE:USO) ETF, known as USO, with a Wells Notice about the intended measures, according to a filing on Wednesday.
The fund was being probed over whether it had adequately disclosed risks to investors after it was forced to dramatically reshuffle the mix of futures contracts it tracked during the market turmoil. That helped protect the ETF, but meant deviating from its past investment strategy.
The notice states that the SEC has made a preliminary decision to recommend an enforcement action against the ETF, its Chief Executive Officer John Love and United States Commodity Funds, the company which manages USO. The decision relates to disclosures made in late April and early May.
USCF, USO and Love said they intend to vigorously contest any allegations. Judy Burns, an SEC spokesperson, declined to comment.
It’s the latest dramatic twist in the story of USO, which was at the center of the storm as crude prices plunged earlier this year. As volatility swept the market, it issued six disclosures in less than two months announcing changes to the fund’s investment strategy, and temporarily halted new share creations -- potentially untethering itself from the contracts it was tracking.

Despite the drama, the ETF remains a major player in oil futures with more than $4 billion in assets. Industry experts say the SEC notice is unlikely to change that.
“Unfortunately I think many investors wanting to make a bet on an oil recovery as the global economy improves will be undaunted,” said Todd Rosenbluth, head of ETF and mutual fund research at CFRA Research. “USO is different than previously constructed -- and many investors have not budged.”
Popular Product
Despite its complexity, USO has long been a vehicle of choice for many traders playing the oil market.
Even at the peak of the selloff, a record amount of cash was flowing into the fund as investors tried to time the bottom. On April 20 -- the day crude prices fell below zero -- the ETF attracted more than half a billion dollars.
USO is up about 80% since its low that day, meaning many of those investors will be happy. However any who were betting against the fund would have been burned by the emergency steps it took to protect itself.
Meanwhile there were plenty who were invested before the turmoil hit. Class action lawsuits were filed in June alleging that they weren’t properly warned of the risks involved.
“I suspect the SEC will simply issue fines to the manager and expect procedural changes,” said Dave Nadig, chief investment officer and director of research at ETF Flows. “‘I seriously doubt investors will flee as it’s a bit of a unique vehicle. Yes, there are other crude based ETFs, but none have the name recognition among traders nor the liquidity.”
A Wells Notice is nether a formal charge of wrongdoing nor a final determination that any law has been violated. The fund was at times ordered by exchange operators to make changes to its giant position.

Gilead's antiviral medicine remdesivir has put the company at the forefront of the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic, sending its shares soaring, but analysts said the FDA move could cost it millions in delayed sales while it fights to get the drug approved.
Last year, Gilead invested $5.1 billion in a major expansion of its partnership with Belgo-Dutch biotech  Galapagos  NV (AS:GLPG), banking on the potential of filgotinib and other drugs in development. Shares of Gilead were down 3% at $66.83 in Wednesday morning trade, while U.S. shares of Galapagos were down 27%.
In its complete response letter, the FDA expressed concerns regarding the overall benefit/risk profile of the 200 mg dose of the treatment and asked for additional data from ongoing studies before completing its review, according to Gilead.
J.P. Morgan analyst Cory Kasimov, who had forecast $2 billion in annual peak sales for the drug, said the request for data could delay any potential approval by at least a year, while ""the potential lack of dosing flexibility"" could hurt the drug's competitive profile. 
""There is no simple fix to these complex issues, putting the entire filgotinib program (rheumatoid arthritis and beyond) at risk,""  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) analyst Evan Seigerman said in a note.
Filgotinib belongs to a class of oral drugs called JAK inhibitors which target a range of autoimmune diseases and include AbbVie's (N:ABBV) Rinvoq and Eli Lilly's (N:LLY) Olumiant as well as  Pfizer 's (N:PFE) experimental drug abrocitinib.

The oral JAK inhibitor class of molecules has produced robust efficacy results in immune and inflammatory disorders but risk/benefit profiles of these molecules have been a constant overhang due to safety and tolerability concerns, Guggenheim analysts said in a note.

 Target  (NYSE:TGT) stock rose 7.3% and home improvement expert Lowe's (NYSE:LOW) stock rose 1.4% after both handsomely beat expectations for profit in the second quarter, corroborating the trend set by Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and  Home Depot  (NYSE:HD) on Tuesday. 
However, that failed to translate into a broader rally, on the perception that the results reflected more a reallocation of spending towards essentials and smaller fixer-upper jobs during the pandemic, rather than any intrinsic strength in consumer spending.  That sense was reinforced as TJX (NYSE:TJX)'s earnings showed the vulnerability to lockdown orders of retailers without adequate an e-commerce channel. TJX stock fell 8.9% after the company posted a $214 million net loss for the quarter.
By 10:15 AM ET (1415 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 105 points, or 0.4%, at 27,884 points. The S&P 500, which hit a new record high for the first time since February on Tuesday, was up 0.1% and the Nasdaq Composite was flat.
It was an active morning for biotech with Gilead (NASDAQ:GILD) stock falling 2.9% to its lowest since February after the Food and Drug Administration refused to approve what analysts had expected to be a blockbuster drug for rheumatoid arthritis. Gilead, whose experimental antiviral drug remdesivir was seen only weeks ago as adding billions of dollars to the company's value, is now trading below where it did before the pandemic. ADRs in Galapagos (NASDAQ:GLPG), Gilead's Dutch partner in the project, fell 25% to their lowest in over a year.
It was a different story for Momenta  (NASDAQ:MNTA), which surged 69% after Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) agreed to buy it in a $6.5 billion deal.  J&J stock was up 0.6%, with at least one Momenta shareholder complaining that the company had got it on the cheap.
On the flip side, Sorrento Therapeutics (NASDAQ:SRNE) stock fell another 7.3% after the company fired its chief financial officer Jiong Shao. The company had talked up the identification of an antibody that it claimed provided a 100% reliable defense against the Covid-19 virus back in May, only two months after warning that it was running out of cash. Sorrento has attracted the interest of more than one short-seller due to doubts about its governance, but still has a market value of nearly $3 billion.
Movements in most stocks were kept within limits by the expected release of minutes from the Federal Reserve's latest meeting at 2 PM ET, which comes against the backdrop of increased speculation that the Fed will adjust its inflation strategy in such a way as to keep interest rates lower for longer.

GM's electric vehicles, many of which will be all-electric battery cars, will be manufactured in China with almost all parts coming from local suppliers, the company said in a statement released at its Tech Day event in Shanghai.
Reuters reported earlier on Wednesday that GM was planning to overhaul its Chinese line-up to stem a slide of sales after more than two decades of growth in a country that contributes nearly a fifth of its profit.
GM's new China boss Julian Blissett told Reuters that new technologies, such as EVs and cars with near hands-free driving for highways, would play a key role in GM's China initiatives, which are part of a push to get annual sales in the country back to the 4 million peak it hit in 2017.
GM did not say in its statement how many new or significantly redesigned models it was planning to launch in China over the next five years.
""China will play a crucial role in making our vision a reality,"" GM CEO Mary Barra said in the statement, referring to its initiative to create what it describes as a future of ""zero crashes, zero emissions and zero congestion"" through electrification and smart-driving technologies.

GM has said it plans to invest more than $20 billion in electric and automated vehicles globally by 2025. It was not clear how much of that investment will be spent in China.

TJX reported a net loss of $214.2 million, or 18 cents per share in the second quarter ended Aug. 1, from a profit of about $759 million, or 62 cents per share last year.
Excluding certain items, the retailer lost 18 cents per share, compared with Wall Street expectations of 10 cents per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
TJX, a go-to for deal-seeking shoppers, also cut working hours and limited the numbers of customers at its stores at a point when other retailers have been doubling-down on promotions.
The company also projected that same-store sales at reopened stores will drop 10-20% in the third quarter, as traffic and demand have moderated after an initial surge following reopening of its stores.
Net sales came in at $6.67 billion, compared with $9.78 billion last year. However, analysts on average were projecting net sales of $6.57 billion.

U.S. same-store sales at its reopened HomeGoods stores rose 20%, while that at its Marmaxx stores fell 6%.

(Reuters) - Southwest Airlines (N:LUV) said on Wednesday it expects cash burn in the third quarter to slow as bookings improve modestly for August and September, even as demand remains choppy due to the coronavirus crisis, forcing the carrier to cut back its flight schedule.
An improvement in bookings had stalled in early July and they remained depressed throughout the month due to a rise in COVID-19 cases, Southwest added. 
Shares of the U.S. budget carrier, rose more than 3% in premarket trade after the company forecast lower current-quarter cash burn of about $20 million per day, compared with its prior estimate of about $23 million per day.
Southwest, which has one of the strongest financial positions among U.S. airlines, said https:// it has decided to not participate in a U.S. government secured loan program as it had taken actions to boost liquidity, and could secure additional financing at favorable terms, if needed. 
The company said its third-quarter capacity would likely slump between 30% and 35%, compared with its prior expectation of a 20% to 30% drop, with October capacity expected to decrease in the 40% to 50% range, year over year.
Southwest, which has limited the number of seats sold on each flight allowing passengers more space through October, now expects August 2020 operating revenue to fall between 70% and 75% from a year earlier, compared with its earlier estimate of a decline of 70% to 80%. 

The slide in revenue in September is expected to slow to between 65% and 75% from August, the airline said.

The company also posted a 34.2% rise in quarterly same-store sales, beating analysts' estimates of a 13.2% increase, and said the momentum was carrying into August.
With a large base of do-it-yourself customers, Lowe's has been among the chief beneficiaries of people undertaking minor home repair, painting or gardening work during the crisis. 
That helped the company's same-store sales far outpace the 23.4% rise recorded by larger rival  Home Depot  Inc (N:HD), which relies more on demand from handymen, carpenters and professional contractors, whose businesses have only recently started to pick up.
Wedbush Securities analysts estimate that nearly 75% of Lowe's sales come from DIY customers, compared with about 55% for Home Depot.

""Lowe's Q2 is one for the record books,"" Well Fargo analysts wrote, adding that while DIY demand could slow in coming quarters, Lowe's would still see the benefits of more people moving out to suburban areas - closer to where a majority of its stores are located. 
Total net sales rose 30.1% to $27.30 billion, beating expectations of $24.27 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Net earnings rose nearly 70% to $2.83 billion, or $3.74 per share, in the quarter, despite the company spending about $460 million on improving store safety, as well as additional compensation for its employees working during the crisis. 
Excluding items, the company earned $3.75 per share, while analysts had expected a profit of $2.95 per share.

Shares of the company were up 1.5% in trading before the bell.

ZURICH (Reuters) - Roche is adding its manufacturing muscle and global development expertise to Regeneron (NASDAQ:REGN)'s bid to create an antibody cocktail for COVID-19 that the Swiss and U.S. companies hope can be used to slow the pandemic. 
Regeneron, which expects data from REGN-COV2 in humans next month after it prevented and treated the disease in rhesus macaques and hamsters, would handle U.S. sales and Roche worldwide distribution should it win approval, the companies said on Wednesday.
Roche has one of the world's largest antibody production operations, including U.S. facilities in San Francisco, and will boost overall capacity for REGN-COV2 by at least three and a half times, a feat Regeneron would have been hard pressed to accomplish going it alone. 
""This major collaboration with Roche provides important scale and global expertise to bring REGN-COV2 to many more patients in the United States and around the globe,"" Regeneron Chief Executive Leonard Schleifer said.
Roche's move to join up comes after its own drug, Actemra, failed in a trial against COVID-19.
The companies will fund and run ongoing late-stage Phase 3 prevention and earlier-stage Phase 1 healthy volunteers safety studies, as well as additional studies to evaluate REGN-COV2 in treating or preventing COVID-19.
The medicine combines one Regeneron-made antibody and a second antibody isolated from humans who recovered from COVID-19. 
The combination is designed to bind to the spike protein used by the new coronavirus to gain access to human cells, limiting its ability to escape.
Zuercher Kantonalbank analyst Michael Nawrath said he expects REGN-COV2 to win regulators' blessings.
""With big biotech facilities at its Genentech unit, Roche can quickly scale up production capacity,"" Nawrath wrote. ""Global supplies can be guaranteed, something Regeneron couldn't have done by itself.""

Roche shares were up 1.1% at 1056 GMT.

1137,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 19, 2020 07:15AM ET</span>","Exclusive: Plant-based egg maker JUST sees profit next year, then will look at IPO","By Richa Naidu
CHICAGO (Reuters) - As shoppers raise grocery spending due to the COVID-19 pandemic, plant-based egg startup JUST says it aims to turn an operating profit before the end of next year and then will consider an initial public offering.
Expectations for an IPO of the company, officially called Eat Just Inc, have been fueled by a boom in demand for plant-based food. Led by companies including Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND) and Impossible Foods, U.S. retail sales of plant-based food rose 11% last year to $5 billion, with the faux egg market nearly tripling, according to market research firm SPINS.
San Francisco-based JUST makes a mung bean-based egg substitute that comes in bottles and looks like beaten fresh eggs. JUST, which makes a mayonnaise substitute as well, sells its products in stores including Walmart (NYSE:WMT), Kroger (NYSE:KR) and Whole Foods. With COVID-19 driving demand for groceries, sales have risen at plant-based food companies, including Beyond Meat which tripled retail sales in the April-June quarter.
JUST Chief Executive Officer Josh Tetrick said that when the pandemic began spreading he thought it would delay any plans for the company to go public. But homebound customers increased purchases. 
""It makes it more likely we'll go public sooner,"" he said. ""The target to hit operating profitability is sometime before the end of 2021,"" he added.
""Once we hit operating profitability, then I'll really begin considering an IPO with my team and with my board and with some of our major shareholders,"" he said.
It is the first time the company has indicated when it could turn profitable and possibly list.
To cut costs, Tetrick said the company needs to find ways to extract more protein from mung beans, and buy more beans from its suppliers in East Africa and Asia so it can negotiate lower costs. Eat Just, which sells products in China and Europe, said it also expects a sales boost from deals with consumer companies, retailers and chicken egg suppliers around the world. 

Beyond Meat sold shares for $25 each when it went public in May 2019 - the stock is now worth about $124 per share.

1138,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 19, 2020 06:58AM ET</span>",Stocks - U.S. Futures Higher Ahead of Fed Minutes; Dow Futures Up 56 Pts,"By Peter Nurse   
Investing.com - U.S. stocks are set to edge higher at the open Wednesday, continuing Tuesday’s positive tone after the benchmark S&P 500 index registered a record close. Investors will be keeping an eye on the Federal Reserve minutes as well as more earnings from the retail sector.
At 7 AM ET (1100 GMT), US 500 Futures traded 6 points, or 0.2%, higher, the Dow Futures contract rose 56 points, or 0.2%, while Nasdaq 100 Futures gained 14 points, or 0.1%.
At the close Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 0.2%, while theS&P 500 added 0.2%, closing at an all-time peak, and the Nasdaq Composite index added 0.7%, its 18th record closing high since early June.
The closely-watched S&P 500 index has made up all the losses seen when the  onset of the Covid-19 pandemic drove the benchmark index to lows on March 23. This has taken just 126 days, the fastest ever recovery from a bear market.
Driving this recovery has been the Federal Reserve's intervention in financial markets to maintain liquidity in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic, as well as cutting interest rates to near zero.
With this in mind, investors will pay close attention to minutes from the Federal Reserve's latest meeting, due later in the day, for how the central bank sees the economic recovery and for clues over future action at its next meeting.
Additionally, hopes are rising that there could be a deal on a scaled-down stimulus package from Congress, after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi indicated that Democrats could reduce their proposal to reach a consensus with Republicans. 
The retail sector will remain in the spotlight, after strong numbers from  Home Depot  (NYSE:HD) and Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Tuesday. Both Lowe’s (NYSE:LOW) and  Target  (NYSE:TGT) continued the positive trend, with strong second-quarter comparable sales increases. TJX (NYSE:TJX) is also due to report earnings Wednesday.
Oil prices weakened Wednesday, consolidating after overnight gains on the back of a drop in U.S. crude inventories of 4.3 million barrels, industry data from the American Petroleum Institute showed after the markets closed on Tuesday.
Investors will now look for the official U.S. government inventory data later Wednesday, as well as a meeting of most of the major oil producing countries in the world to review adherence to their deal on oil output cuts.
U.S. crude futures traded 0.8% lower at $42.76 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract fell 0.8% to $45.11. 
Elsewhere, gold futures fell 0.9% to $1,995.30/oz, retreating below the $2,000 level. EUR/USD traded 0.1% higher at 1.1938, on course to touch $1.20 for the first time in over two years.

Investments such as commercial mortgage-backed securities, private credit for middle-market companies and preferred shares are among those that offer opportunities, said Tony Rodriguez, head of fixed income strategy at Nuveen, which has about $1 trillion under management.
“This environment requires a fairly well and broadly diversified portfolio,” Rodriguez said in an interview Monday. “There’s too high a cost to sitting in cash at zero. While 3% to 4% doesn’t sound awesome, it’s significantly larger than zero.”
More than $15 trillion of bonds globally come with negative yields after central banks slashed borrowing costs and rolled out unconventional policies to counter the impact of the pandemic. Some investors have flocked to stocks as a result, taking the view that there are few other viable paths to reasonable returns. That stance is sometimes encapsulated by the acronym “TINA” -- or “there is no alternative.”
In a report, Nuveen said alternatives have “tremendous untapped potential” to help institutional investors in particular with cash flow challenges.
The firm recommends building a portfolio around risk factors, noting that private credit, real assets, real estate and non-traditional segments of fixed income can provide both diversification and attractive income streams.
Rodriguez sees some opportunities in high-yield bonds rated BB or B from companies that have durable free cash flow prospects. He also likes sovereigns with solid balance sheets and “reasonable” currency policy, for instance in Eastern Europe.
Concentration risk is one of the biggest challenges for portfolios now, he said.
“It’s not easy on the surface necessarily to see the risks you’re taking,” Rodriguez said. “Don’t have a portfolio that surprises you down that road because you have a concentration of risks you weren’t aware of.”

LONDON (Reuters) - Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) has stepped up its move into Britain's grocery market, expanding its relationship with Morrisons so Prime members have access to the supermarket group's full range on the internet giant's main website.
Amazon and Morrisons have had a tie-up since 2016 and have been steadily expanding their links, leading to speculation that the U.S. group could even emerge as a possible bidder for Britain's No. 4 supermarket chain. Both sides habitually decline comment on such market talk. 
The coronavirus pandemic has seen a marked rise in demand for online groceries. Market researcher Nielsen said on Tuesday online grocery participation had grown to 14% of the UK grocery market in the 12 weeks to Aug. 8, double its pre-crisis rate.
Amazon and Morrisons said on Wednesday that Prime members would as part of their subscription be able to receive same-day delivery on orders of more than 40 pounds ($53) for no extra cost directly on the Amazon.co.uk website. 
For orders worth less than 40 pounds there will be a 3.99 pound delivery charge. 
They said ""Morrisons on Amazon"" launched in Leeds, northern England, and will be expanded to millions of Prime members across the United Kingdom in the coming weeks.
It will offer thousands of grocery products including meat, seafood, dairy and baked goods, fruit and vegetables. Prices will be the same as at Morrisons' stores.
Orders will be picked from local Morrisons stores by Morrisons staff and delivered to customers by Amazon partners.
Prime is Amazon's core retail proposition, costing an annual membership fee of 79 pounds. Membership provides access to unlimited one-day delivery as well as services such as TV, movies and music.
The Morrisons deal builds on Amazon's move last month to begin free delivery of its own grocery service to Prime members. 
Morrisons, which has a 10.2% market share, trails market leader Tesco (OTC:TSCDY), Sainsbury's and Walmart (NYSE:WMT)'s Asda in annual sales.
Earlier this week Tesco CEO Dave Lewis told The Sunday Telegraph it planned to add free delivery to its Clubcard Plus loyalty scheme.

1142,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 19, 2020 05:45AM ET</span>",StockBeat: Maersk Steers Toward Calmer Waters,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- How does a company come out of a pandemic that is likely to disrupt its business model with higher profit expectations than when it went into it?
The answer, in the case of Danish shipping giant AP Moeller-Maersk (CSE:MAERSKa), is reduced competition. In contrast to 2008, when the last great crisis wrongfooted an industry that had bet on an endless expansion of global seaborne trade, the shipping market is more concentrated, allowing industry heavyweights such as Maersk to keep a high degree of pricing power.
According to the International Transport Forum, an arm of the OECD, major shipping companies cut 20% of Trans-Pacific sailings in the second quarter and 30% of Far East-Europe sailings, ensuring that freight rates remained generally stable and ensuring that ports and importers took as much of the financial strain as possible.  Sympathetic regulation has helped: the European Commission earlier this year extended until 2024 a partial waiver on antitrust rules that allow Maersk and its competitors to share capacity.
In addition, the present crisis comes at a time when lenders, especially in Europe, are still working off the hangover of the last shipping boom, unwilling to finance all but the most reliably profitable new capacity. There is no new fleet of almost-finished freighters all-but ready to hit the market. Order deferrals and cancellations are likely to ensure that the 5% rise in capacity that was expected at the start of 2020 doesn’t materialize.  
As a result of all this, the Baltic Exchange Dry Index, a measure of freight shipping costs, may have plumbed a five-year low in May but has rebounded more than fourfold since to be comfortably above its five-year average.
Even so, the extent of Maersk’s ability to withstand the obvious pressure surprised the market on Wednesday.  Maersk stock rose 4.8% to its highest since December after the company not only reported earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization at $1.7 billion– nearly 10% above expectations – but also reinstated its guidance for the year at a level above the initial estimates that it withdrew in the spring due to the pandemic.
The company now expects EBITDA of between $6 and $7 billion, compared to an initial forecast of $5.5 billion. Inevitably, it’s warning that the pandemic still represents a “significant uncertainty”, but actions speak louder than words: the company spent over 85% of free cash flow in the first half of the year on share buybacks, dividends and acquisitions. That hardly qualifies as hunkering down for hard times ahead.
It would be premature to see in this a sign of life for the world economy as it emerges from the pandemic. The post-2008 glut, the struggle with an internal reorganization that saw it split from unrelated oil drilling activities and, most of all, the course of U.S trade policy have all had more of an influence on Maersk at various points in time.
What it does signal, pretty clearly, is that a company that lost two-thirds of its value over the last five years has found the answer to its biggest problems and is sailing into calmer waters."
1143,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 19, 2020 03:43AM ET</span>",Stocks - Europe Edges Higher After Trump's China Blast; Maersk Surges,"By Peter Nurse 
Investing.com - European stock markets traded largely flat Wednesday, with investors wary about U.S.-China relations, rising tensions in Belarus and ahead of the release of key European inflation data and minutes from the Federal Reserve.
At 3:45 AM ET (0745 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.1% higher, the CAC 40 in France rose 0.1% and the U.K.'s FTSE index was unchanged.
The market overcame initial concern at harsh words by U.S. President Donald Trump saying late Tuesday that he had cancelled a scheduled session of trade talks with China at the end of last week because he ""didn't want to talk to them.""
The phase one trade deal has been the most stable point in this tempestuous relationship. But Trump's comments indicated that the deal may be in trouble. 
""We are approaching the period of peak risk,"" said UBS Global Wealth Management chief economist Paul Donovan in a morning note. Trump, he noted, could announce new tariffs ahead of the election ""to look tough on China,"" and put off the hit to U.S. purchasing power and the global economy until after the election.

1145,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 19, 2020 03:00AM ET</span>",The Best Days May Be Over for Europe’s Equity Rally This Year,"(Bloomberg) -- European equities are stuck near the same levels they were at two months ago, and if strategists are to be believed, that rut may drag on into the year-end.
Equity strategists surveyed by Bloomberg on average expect the Stoxx Europe 600 to end 2020 at a level of 370, leaving little upside for European shares as of Tuesday’s close. They forecast a year-end level of 3,192 for the euro-area gauge Euro Stoxx 50, implying about 3% downside.
After recouping more than half their pandemic-fueled losses in just three months, European stocks have stalled amid rising Covid-19 infection rates across the globe and renewed tensions between the U.S. and China.
“I expect a volatile, broad sideways movement in the next few months,” Unicredit (MI:CRDI) SpA strategist Christian Stocker said. “There is not one single risk currently but a mixture of different risks or uncertainties such as simmering tensions between the U.S. and China, a renewed accelerating Covid-19 spread in Europe, (and) this goes hand in hand with high uncertainty about the speed of economic recovery and, therefore, company earnings,” he added.
Although strategists see stocks going nowhere in Europe, globally, investors are turning more optimistic. Fund managers in Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC).’s August survey were bullish on equities, no longer viewing gains as a bear market rally, but expecting higher growth, profits and inflation. The euro area is now the most preferred region globally, with allocation at a net 33% overweight, the highest since May 2018, according to BofA’s survey.
“We think this macro recovery has further to go,” Bank of America strategist Sebastian Raedler said, adding that he expects both global and euro-area PMIs to rise by a further 5 points before peaking late in the third quarter or early in the fourth quarter. This implies a “further 15% upside for European equities,” said the strategist, who sees the Stoxx 600 at 410 by year-end.
According to Raedler, the biggest risk for markets would be the derailing of the macroeconomic recovery that could be caused by U.S. lawmakers failing to pass further fiscal stimulus, as well as renewed lockdowns in response to spikes in Covid-19 cases.
For the DAX Index in Germany, Europe’s growth engine, strategists predict a year-end level of 12,246, suggesting a drop of about 5% from Tuesday’s close. The benchmark has rallied more than 50% since its March lows, outperforming the broader European market and even the S&P 500 Index. The U.K.’s FTSE 100 Index, on the other hand, has lagged the wider recovery amid Brexit worries and a heavy weighting of value shares. It’s predicted to finish 2020 at 6,293 on average, implying a gain of about 3.5%.

1146,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 19, 2020 02:45AM ET</span>",Asian stocks pause for breath after Wall Street's record run,"By Swati Pandey and Chibuike Oguh
SYDNEY (Reuters) - A gauge of Asian shares eased on Wednesday led by losses in Chinese and Hong Kong stocks, though it was still near a seven-month peak, driven by ever expanding policy stimulus aimed at cushioning the blow from the coronavirus pandemic.
In an indication of positive start for Europe, futures for Eurostoxx 50 and Germany's Dax rose 0.3% each while London's FTSE futures Added 0.2%. 
E-Minis for the S&P 500 were last up 0.15%.
Asian shares had started the day on a positive note too before profit taking emerged in Chinese and Hong Kong shares.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside of Japan snapped two straight days of gains, dipping 0.1% after earlier hitting a high of 571.33 points, a level not seen since late January.
China's blue-chip index slipped 1% following a strong rally in recent days, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng was off 0.9%.
Australian shares finished 0.8% higher and South Korea added 0.8%. Japan's Nikkei rose 0.25%.
While emerging markets found some support from the low-yielding environment and a weaker U.S. dollar, worries about the economic hit from the pandemic kept investors jittery, analysts said.
""Continued economic impacts of the current crisis and limited capacity for fiscal and monetary stimulus, except for China, have weighed on sentiment despite the slump in the USD,"" analysts at T. Rowe Price wrote in a note.
""While a lower USD removes a significant headwind for emerging markets assets, bigger risks abound for broader EM as they continue to weather the crisis.""
On Tuesday, both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite set records soon after the opening bell, helped by strong sales growth reported by major U.S. retailers including Walmart (NYSE:WMT), Kohl's (NYSE:KSS) and  Home Depot  (NYSE:HD).
The closely-watched S&P 500 topped an all-time peak reached in February just before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic drove the benchmark index to lows on March 23. The index has surged about 55% since then.
At just 126 days, that ""is the fastest bear market recovery ever,"" said Tapas Strickland, economist at Melbourne-based National Australia Bank (OTC:NABZY).
Nasdaq clocked its 18th record closing high since early June.
The U.S. Federal Reserve's intervention in financial markets to maintain liquidity in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic has pushed risk assets to all-time highs and reduced demand for safe-havens, weakening the greenback.
Market optimism was also buoyed by data showing an acceleration in U.S. homebuilding to the most in nearly four years in July, signifying that the housing sector is emerging as one of the few areas of strength.
In addition, hopes of an interim fiscal package were re-ignited overnight with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi indicating a willingness to cut their proposals in order to seal a deal, NAB's Strickland noted.
Markets were also paying close attention to minutes from the Fed's recent meeting due later in the day ""for any hints on what the Fed could announce regarding forward guidance come September,"" Strickland said.
The Fed has cut rates to near zero to bolster business through the pandemic, sending the dollar to a 27-month low.
The dollar index was last barely changed at 92.22 from above-100 in March. The safe haven Japanese yen was a tad lower at 105.50 versus the greenback.
The risk-sensitive Australian dollar traded near $0.7250, while the kiwi last bought $0.6621.
Gold flirted with key charted resistance of $2,000 an ounce to be last at $1,989.6. 
U.S. gold futures were a shade weaker at $2,001.5.

BERLIN (Reuters) - Berlin travel-booking app Omio said on Wednesday it had raised $100 million in backing to expand its business and make acquisitions as the industry recovers from the blow dealt by the COVID-19 pandemic.
At the height of the viral outbreak, Omio went into ""keep-the-lights-on"" mode and put 90% of its staff on furlough, founder and CEO Naren Shaam told Reuters, but its team of 350 is now working again at full strength.
The company, which offers travel search and bookings for flights, trains, buses and other forms of transport, said it was seeing a shift away from air towards ground travel.
That shift supports margins, but purchases and distances travelled are smaller, said Shaam. More people are also booking at the last minute, putting a premium on the flexibility offered by its smartphone app, he added.
Bookings though the platform are back above half pre-pandemic levels in Omio's core markets of Germany and France although it is still beaten down in the United States, which it entered at the start of this year.
""Business is coming back much stronger than we expected,"" the Indian-born, Harvard-educated entrepreneur said in an interview.
Existing and new investors took part in the round, including Singaporean wealth fund Temasek, Sweden's Kinnevik (ST:KINVb), Goldman Sachs (N:GS), NEA - a backer of U.S. share trading app Robinhood - and Kleiner Perkins.
The round took the form of convertible notes that investors will be able to switch, at a discount, into shares in Omio when it holds its next equity fund raising.
Shaam said it would be at least a couple of years before he starts thinking about another equity round. Omio had previously attracted $296 million from investors.

Omio is reviewing ""a lot of opportunities"" for acquisitions, he added, having bought Australian route-discovery specialist Rome2Rio last October.

Aviation has been one of the industries worst hit during the COVID-19 pandemic and airlines around the world expect it will take years before travel returns to pre-pandemic levels.
The lessor did not say how many aircraft were affected by the agreement, although according to Airbus' website it currently has 43 A320neo and 10 A321neo jets on order to be delivered.
Under the agreement, advance payments to be made between now and the next three years will instead be due from 2024 onwards, Alafco said in a bourse filing.
Airbus did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.
Earlier this month, Alafco said it had halved its order for 40 Boeing (N:BA) 737 jets after ending its legal claim over a cancelled order for the planes.

Alafco's owners include Kuwait Finance House (KW:KFH), Gulf Investment Corporation and state airline Kuwait Airways, according to its website.

1150,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 19, 2020 02:18AM ET</span>",A Huge Tesla Bet Pays Off Big for one British Fund,"(Bloomberg) -- A British fund that has grown more than seven times faster than peers this year has one big bet to thank.
Scottish Mortgage Investment Trust Plc’s holding of 1.87 million shares in Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc. has increased in value by more than $2 billion since the end of March as the electric carmaker’s stock price has surged to a record. That, along with investments in other U.S. tech giants and stay-at-home winners, means the fund has provided a year-to-date return of 55% versus 7.1% for its peer group, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The growth of the closed-end investment fund -- which these days is global and has nothing to do with its roots in mortgages -- has helped cement its position in the U.K.’s FTSE 100 benchmark. The shares are among the index’s top five winners of 2020 with a gain that matches its fund performance. Tesla now accounts for about 11% of 12.8 billion pounds ($16.9 billion) in total assets, even though the fund trimmed its stake earlier this year.
Scottish Mortgage “has benefited from good stock picks as well as being in sectors which have been favored during the global pandemic,” Robert Starkey, an analyst at investment research group Morningstar, said in emailed comments. Looking slightly longer-term, its net asset value has more than doubled over the past three years, the fund’s website shows.
Other stocks among the fund’s top ten holdings have been beneficiaries of stay-at-home trends due to the Covid-19 pandemic, including e-commerce giants Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN). and  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd., streaming group Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX)., and food-delivery service provider Delivery Hero SE.
Yet it’s Tesla that has been at the forefront of its outperformance. The carmaker’s stock has more than quadrupled this year, fueled by a better-than-expected performance in China and growing anticipation that the company will be included in the S&P 500 Index.
Scottish Mortgage is one of many funds run by Baillie Gifford & Co. that own Tesla stock. That makes the Edinburgh-based investment-management firm the company’s largest shareholder behind co-founder and Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk with a stake across all its funds of about 6.3%.
Stake Trimmed
Scottish Mortgage’s gains would have been even greater had it not cut its stake in Tesla by about 125,000 shares in the first quarter, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. In doing so, the fund missed out on about $164 million in additional value, based on Aug. 17 closing prices.
Among Scottish Mortgage’s current top 20 equity holdings by market value, Tesla was the only one whose stake was reduced during the first half of the year, Bloomberg data show.
In trimming the holding, the fund’s managers were making adjustments to reflect their views “on the overall balance of the portfolio rather than simply the individual Tesla holding,” a spokesman said by email. “The managers remain supportive holders of Tesla,” he said.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - The owner of skin care brand FANCL in Asia ex-Japan has hired  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) to initiate a sale, targeting strategic and private equity investors for a deal that could fetch $1 billion, said people with knowledge of the matter.
Hong Kong-based Chris Chan is sole distributor of FANCL Corp's (T:4921) brand in Asia outside its home market of Japan, operating over 200 stores in Greater China and Southeast Asia via his company CMC Holdings.
The sale, which has not been reported before, comes as the retail sector globally grapples with shifts in consumer spending brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic.
China, which accounts for around 80% of FANCL Asia revenue, has seen locked-down stores re-open since the second quarter of the year. However, retail sales are recovering slower than market expectations.
Still, Asia accounts for 53% of global skin care sales, showed Euromonitor data, with researchers generally expecting annual growth of over 5% in the next five years.
FANCL Asia will run a two-round auction with first-round bids expected by September-end, said one of the people, who declined to be identified due to confidentiality constraints.
Chan，CMC Holdings and Morgan Stanley declined to comment.
FANCL Corp is not involved in the sale, and distribution contracts will be unaffected by ownership change, the people said.
FANCL Corp, known for its preservative-free cosmetics and supplements, declined to comment on the sale. A spokesman said the company could not confirm details of its agreement with CMC, citing confidentiality requirements.
LONG-TIME DISTRIBUTOR
FANCL Asia reported $60 million to $70 million in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) in 2018 and 2019, and projects likewise for 2020, said one of the people.
With annual revenue of $250 million to $300 million and profit margin as much as over 20%, a sale is likely to fetch a multiple of more than 10 times EBITDA, the person said.
FANCL Corp itself was valued at over 20 times its EBITDA when it sold 30% of itself to brewer Kirin Holdings Co Ltd (T:2503) for $1.2 billion last year, said one of the people.
The Tokyo-listed company in its April-June earnings call said Hong Kong sales through the distributor were less than half of the previous period, though there was a slight increase in China.
It also said it was negotiating with the distributor to launch e-commerce platforms as soon as possible.
Chan has been FANCL's sole distributor outside Japan for 25 years. His contract for China expires in six years while that for the rest of Asia expires in 10, said the people.

BOSTON/TOKYO (Reuters) - U.S. hedge fund Third Point (NYSE:TPRE) LLC, which had been pressing  Sony  Corp (T:6758) to make changes including spinning-off of its chip unit, has sold all of its American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) in the Japanese conglomerate, regulatory filings showed.
The fund, headed by one of the world's highest-profile activist investors, Daniel Loeb, still owns a large amount of Sony (NYSE:SNE)'s Japanese stock, a person familiar with the fund said.
The sale comes just over a year since sources told Reuters that Third Point was raising an investment vehicle targeting $500 million to $1 billion in capital to buy Sony shares.
It owned 1.5 million Sony ADRs at December-end worth about $100 million, showed Third Point filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
The number was 675,000 at the end of March and, as at the end of June, latest filings no longer listed Sony.
SEC filings show what investors hold in U.S. stock. They give no indication of foreign holdings, such as how much Third Point owns in Sony's common stock listed in Japan.
Sony said it does not comment on individual shareholders. Third Point declined to comment.
Sony's Tokyo-listed shares were down 2.3% in afternoon trade in a flat broader market, due primarily to concerns that ramped-up U.S. restrictions on customer Huawei Technologies Co Ltd could drag on its chip business.
TARGET
New York-based Third Point said it was building a stake in Sony last year when it called on the firm to spin off its chip business and sell non-core assets such as Sony Financial Holdings Inc (T:8729) to emerge as a global entertainment firm.
The effort marked the second time in six years that Loeb targeted the Japanese conglomerate.
Sony rejected the call to spin off the chip unit, saying the business was ""a crucial growth driver"", and instead of selling Sony Financial, it has moved to take full control.

Still, Sony has been a winner for Third Point. Its share price has surged about 80% since April last year when Reuters first reported that the fund was building a stake.

Many global markets, particularly those in Japan and China, remain a long way below their record peaks and for reasons little to do with the coronavirus. While the feeling of envy might be strongest in Shanghai, where stocks are still over 40% down from their 2007 peak, spare a thought for Japan’s beleaguered investors who last saw a record high back in 1989.
The S&P 500 Index climbed 0.2% to close at 3,389.78 on Tuesday, capping the fastest-ever return to a record after a drop of at least 20%, as investors looked past a collapse in the U.S. economy, bought technology shares and focused on the unprecedented fiscal and monetary stimulus from policy makers. Meanwhile, MSCI’s global gauge of stocks excluding those from the U.S. remains 20% off its high, which was reached in 2007.
“Many continue to wonder why stocks are at new highs with 10% unemployment and nearly a million people filing for initial unemployment claims,” said Ryan Detrick, chief investment strategist for LPL Financial (NASDAQ:LPLA) LLC. “The truth is economic data is backward looking and stocks are looking ahead to a much brighter future.”

SANTIAGO/SAO PAULO (Reuters) - LATAM Airlines (OTC:LTMAQ), South America's largest carrier, on Tuesday said it had laid off 12,600 employees since March - or almost 30% of its pre-coronavirus workforce - due to the pandemic that has upended the global travel industry.
The carrier went from employing almost 43,000 people across Latin America and the United States to 29,957 as of Tuesday, the company said. 
LATAM reported a net loss of $890 million for the second quarter, slammed by the pandemic that drove the company into a Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing in May. 
""COVID-19 has had a very significant impact, which is reflected in the company's numbers,"" LATAM CFO Ramiro Alfonsin told journalists. 
While employees already had their salaries cut by half in late March when the pandemic led to widespread travel restrictions in the region, it said its remaining employees are now facing cuts of 20% through September. 
LATAM and its rivals are struggling to preserve cash while operating just a small fraction of their usual flights. The airline has said it will need to be a smaller carrier for years to come, and it is unclear whether there will be more job cuts in the future. Cutting down its workforce has helped preserve some liquidity. 
The carrier posted a 75% drop in revenue between April and June due to widespread travel restrictions around Latin America. 
LATAM's Chapter 11 filing has allowed it to raise more than $1.3 billion in cash from investors, although it still needs the approval from a bankruptcy judge before it can access the money. 
Alfonsin said the airline had operated during the quarter at 6% of its normal capacity and that demand in Brazil, its largest market, was showing some signs of recovery. 

He added LATAM ended the quarter with a total cash position of $1.4 billion.

1158,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 18, 2020 10:10PM ET</span>",China government-backed class actions take aim at corporate fraud - with limits,"By Samuel Shen and Alun John
SHANGHAI/HONG KONG (Reuters) - China wants its army of mom-and-pop investors to take corporate fraudsters to task with landmark class action lawsuits, but heavy government involvement means they are not likely to be as common as in other legal systems, lawyers and investors said.
The legal framework, which follows a series of scandals and official vows to crack down on corporate malfeasance, is the latest move to deepen and improve capital markets in China, where 80% of trading is conducted by retail investors.
Under the new class-action mechanism, which began on July 31, a Chinese government-affiliated body, the China Securities Investor Service Centre (CSISC), will sue on behalf of all individual investors in a company.
The CSISC said it would initially select ""typical, major cases with wicked social impact and exemplary significance"". Investors and lawyers say that could result in other cases falling by the wayside.
""I think it's going to be complicated … because if a company is very strongly backed, for example, by the local government, do you dare bring a class-action suit against it?"" said Marcia Ellis, Hong Kong-based Partner at Morrison & Forester.
Although corporate fraud is not uncommon in China, retail investors have historically had little chance to make their voices heard. Small investors often likened legal action to ants fighting elephants.
Gao Jianlu, a retail investor in southwest China, said the new class-action framework made it cheaper and easier to sue listed companies.
""Bosses of listed companies will lose their shirts and never rise again,"" Gao wrote in his blog on the trading community site Xueqiu.com.
Accounting fraud at firms including Kangmei Pharmaceutical and Kangde Xin Composite Material Group risk damaging investors' trust in China's financial markets, Yi Huiman, China's top securities regulator, said in May.
Individual investors have sued these companies, and others, under the existing investor-protection rules, but individual cases typically fail to catch courts' attention, while compensation is often negligible, even for major fraud.
GOVERNMENT CONTROL
China's stock market plays an increasingly important role in financing cash-starved companies in a slowing economy and amid rising tensions with the United States.
Investors fear that China's shift toward a disclosure-based initial public offering of shares system, in which companies must meet fewer thresholds to list, could result in more fraudulent companies.
But even with the new framework, class-action lawsuits ""won't be used as extensively in China as they are in the U.S.,"" activist investor Xu Caiyuan said.
Under the new litigation process, either the courts or a regulator must find that a company has broken the rules, or the company must admit wrongdoing, before a class-action lawsuit can be launched.
In addition, class-action suits launched by individuals, not the CSISC, can only include investors who opt in, reducing the number of plaintiffs and the size of the claim.
Yang Seng, a lawyer who has collected claims on 150 cases of corporate fraud during the past two years, said this would sideline lawyers who had been the most active under the previous system.
“I don’t think we’ll see a large wave of class-action lawsuits,"" he said.

BOSTON/TOKYO (Reuters) - U.S. hedge fund Third Point (NYSE:TPRE) LLC, which had been pressing  Sony  Corp (T:6758) to make changes including spinning-off of its chip unit, has sold all of its American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) in the Japanese electronics company, regulatory filings showed.
But the fund, headed by one of the world’s highest-profile activist investors, Daniel Loeb, still owns a large portion of the company's Japanese shares, a person familiar with the fund told Reuters.
The filings showed Third Point owned 1.5 million ADRs at the end of December 2019 and 675,000 at the end of March. At the end of June, Third Point's filing no longer listed Sony (NYSE:SNE) as a holding.
Securities and Exchange Commission filings show what investors hold in U.S. stock. It is not clear from the U.S. filings what Third Point's holdings are in foreign stock or how much it owns in Sony's common stock listed in Japan.
A Sony representative said the company would not comment on individual shareholders. Third Point declined to comment.
Third Point revealed its position in Sony last year when it called on the firm to spin off its highly successful chip business and sell off non-core assets such as Sony Financial to position itself as a leading global entertainment company.
The effort marked the second time in six years that Loeb has targeted the Japanese firm.
Sony rejected the call to spin off the chip unit, saying the business is ""a crucial growth driver"" for the Japanese company, and instead of selling Sony Financial, it took full control.

Still, Sony has been a big winner for the New York-based hedge fund. Shares of Sony have surged about 80% since April last year, when Reuters first reported that the fund was building a stake.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - China and the United States will each allow air carriers to double current flights to eight per week between the world's two largest economies, the U.S. Transportation Department said on Tuesday.
The department said it will allow four Chinese passenger airlines currently flying to the United States to double flights to eight weekly round-trips, as China has agreed to allow U.S. carriers to double flights to China.
U.S. carriers voluntary halted flights to China after the coronavirus outbreak. President Donald Trump on Jan. 31 barred nearly all non-U.S. citizens from traveling to the United States from China.
United Airlines (O:UAL) said Tuesday it will increase flights to China to four flights per week from San Francisco to Shanghai starting Sept. 4, while the department said Delta Air Lines (N:DAL) was also eligible to go from two-times weekly to four-times weekly.
Delta is also going to four flights after it said in June it would operate flights to Shanghai from Seattle and Detroit beginning in July, all via Seoul. On Tuesday, Delta it would add one weekly flight from Detroit and Seattle each to Shanghai, via Seoul, beginning Aug. 24.
The U.S. government still hopes China will agree to restore full U.S. flight rights under their bilateral aviation agreement, the Transportation Department has said, adding as China allows additional flights it will respond in kind.
The U.S.-China agreement allows both countries to operate more than 100 weekly flights between the two nations.
The United States had threatened to bar Chinese passenger flights in June after Beijing did not immediately agree to restore flights by U.S. airlines.
In May, the Trump administration said Air China (SS:601111), China Eastern Airlines (NYSE:CEA) Corp, China Southern Airlines Co (SS:600029), Hainan Airlines Holding Co (SS:600221) and their subsidiaries had to file schedules.

Chinese authorities previously agreed to some changes on requirements for U.S. carriers, including allowing temperature checks to be done before flights take off for China, rather than mid-flight as previously discussed, Reuters reported in June.

(Reuters) -  Citigroup  Inc (N:C) won a small victory on Tuesday in its battle to recoup nearly $900 million it mistakenly sent to creditors of troubled cosmetics company  Revlon Inc  (N:REV).
A U.S. judge blocked a hedge fund from doing anything with its nearly $175 million portion of the payout while he considers a preliminary injunction that could eventually require the firm to repay Citigroup.
In a large blunder, Citigroup last week erroneously repaid a nearly $900 million loan made to Revlon, a day after lenders sued the cosmetic company over its restructuring tactics.
Citi quickly caught the payment error and was taking steps to recover the funds, the bank has said.
Citi had been acting as agent on the loan, meaning it collected payments from Revlon to distribute to the creditors, but the accidental payment came from the bank's own funds. 
The error has drawn scrutiny from regulators who have begun looking into the loan and raised questions about the bank's operational resiliency. 
The regulatory fallout of the mistake is likely to be drawn out, long time banking analyst Dick Bove from Odeon Capital Group said in a research note.
""A payment error by the nation’s only truly international bank is likely to cause significant questions concerning the
systems the bank is using,"" he said.
Brigade Capital Management LP, which got $175 million from the payment, has so far refused to give the money back. Citigroup wired the money to 43 Brigade funds because they were Revlon's lenders, rather than Brigade itself. 
""To target Brigade as if they were the lender here, it just doesn't work and it doesn't make sense with respect to the type of relief they're seeking,"" said Robert Loigman, a lawyer representing Brigade.
An attorney for Citigroup asserted that as manager of the funds, Brigade has the power to return the money to the bank, and that if a judge rules the hedge fund can keep the funds it would create dangerous precedent. 

""We think it creates serious issues for the banking industry If players like Brigade can understand, by all accounts, that this was unintentional, that this was a mistake, and can reap a windfall from it,"" said Matthew Ingber, who represents Citi.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A federal judge on Tuesday rejected Martin Shkreli's effort to dismiss a lawsuit accusing the imprisoned former pharmaceutical executive of trying to monopolize the lifesaving drug Daraprim, whose price he raised more than 4,000% in one day.
U.S. District Judge Denise Cote denied requests by Shkreli and Vyera Pharmaceuticals, which he once ran, to dismiss all but one claim in a civil lawsuit by the Federal Trade Commission, New York Attorney General Letitia James and six other states.
The defendants were accused of scheming to block generic equivalents of Daraprim from entering the market, enabling them in 2015 to boost the drug's cost overnight to $750 from $17.50.
Daraprim treats a potentially fatal infection known as toxoplasmosis.
Lawyers for Shkreli, Vyera, its parent Phoenixus AG and the defendant Kevin Mulleady, who like Shkreli was once Vyera's chief executive, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Nicknamed ""Pharma Bro"" for eccentricities including his use of social media, Shkreli is serving a seven-year prison term following his 2017 conviction for cheating investors in two hedge funds and trying to prop up a biotechnology company's stock price.
The 37-year-old remains best known for the Daraprim price hike, when Vyera was known as Turing Pharmaceuticals.
Cote, who sits in Manhattan, said the complaint plausibly alleged that the defendants violated federal antitrust law by blocking rivals from accessing Daraprim, including when Vyera went so far as to repurchase the drug at above-retail prices.
She also pointed to allegations that Shkreli and Mulleady ""designed, implemented and negotiated the network of contracts"" that blocked Daraprim generics, and may have ""benefitted personally"" from the illegality.

The case is FTC et al v Vyera Pharmaceuticals LLC et al, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 20-00706.

1176,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 18, 2020 05:09PM ET</span>",Chinese AI Giant Blacklisted By Trump Mints Money From Virus,"(Bloomberg) -- The future of China’s largest artificial intelligence company was thrown into question last year when it was blacklisted by the Trump administration. Today, SenseTime is thriving with growing demand for its facial recognition software, especially as local governments in China adopt its technology to battle the coronavirus.
The Hong Kong-based startup’s revenue surged 147% to 5 billion yuan ($720 million) in 2019 and its customer base increased by about 500 to 1,200 clients, according to co-founder Xu Bing. Sales are on track to climb 80% this year to about 9 billion yuan and gross profit could double, according to people familiar with the matter.
“We see business demand for ways to mitigate the virus outbreak on the rise,” Xu said in a phone interview. He and SenseTime declined to comment on revenue projections in an emailed statement.
That momentum has SenseTime contemplating an initial public offering. The company is close to completing a $1.5 billion funding round that values it at about $8.5 billion pre-money, paving the way for a stock sale, people familiar have said. The company is leaning toward a dual listing in Hong Kong and China, the people added.
The Covid-19 pandemic has been extremely controversial ever since infections emerged in Wuhan eight months ago. Countries such as the U.S. blame Chinese authorities for censoring information about the outbreak that could have helped slow the spread. Now China’s economy is recovering quickly from the crisis, while the U.S. and many others struggle to get back on track.
Chinese authorities have succeeded by using laws and technologies that governments like the U.S. have resisted. When a cluster of Covid-19 patients flared up in northeastern China, the government installed sensors to guard the city’s subway entrances. The cameras provided by SenseTime detect whether the passengers are wearing masks, their temperature, and even their identities with their faces covered.
It’s an example of how the ruling Communist Party, once wary of private entrepreneurs, is now supporting technology companies that have come under attack from the Trump administration, including SenseTime, Huawei Technologies Co., Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) Ltd. and ByteDance Ltd., parent of TikTok. The country has pledged to spend $1.4 trillion to develop its own tech industry and overtake the U.S. in key sectors.

In the case of facial recognition, concerns about privacy are taking a back seat while the country militantly traces and tracks outbreaks. Hard-line measures adopted by Beijing allow provincial governments, companies and residential complexes to deploy facial recognition devices with little resistance.
The temptation to use such technology more broadly against the virus has fueled privacy concerns. In April, more than 130 human rights groups published a letter cautioning against an expansion of surveillance powers. “States cannot simply disregard rights such as privacy and freedom of expression in the name of tackling a public health crisis,” it said in the letter.
S
till, business is booming for SenseTime. The SoftBank Group Corp.-backed company is working with 127 cities across China to use cameras to analyze everything from traffic to residential complex security. Its facial recognition program for subways, known as the Smart Commute System, is used in cities from central Zhengzhou and Xi’an to northeastern Harbin.
Passengers can opt to register with the cities’ subway apps to pay their transportation fee using face scans. That can allow them to be identified even with their masks on. The company declined to disclose how many people have selected the program, because the data sits with the respective city governments.
The technology is possible in part because SenseTime zooms in on data points on a person’s face not covered by a mask to enable identification, said Xu. And it’s not the only one working on such technology. Wuhan University, for example, said it’s developed competing software with 90% accuracy, according to a local media report.
“It’s data gravity that nobody can stop. China is pushing facial recognition across the nation during this pandemic,” said Isaac Mao, an angel tech investor. “In the U.S., there are roadblocks including civil society, privacy regulations and governance structure to push back on facial recognition and companies profiting from it are facing a backlash, but in China this is what’s missing.”

1177,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 18, 2020 04:50PM ET</span>",Say goodbye to the shortest bear market in S&P 500 history,"By Saqib Iqbal Ahmed and Noel Randewich
(Reuters) - Well, that was quick! 
The S&P 500's (SPX) record closing high on Tuesday confirmed that the coronavirus-fueled bear market of 2020 was by far the shortest ever. 
Measured from the benchmark's previous record high on Feb. 19 to its trough on March 23, the pandemic-induced bear market lasted a mere 33 days, compared to the median age of 302 days of 20 bear markets going back to the 1920s, according to Yardeni Research data. 
GRAPHIC: Barely there - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/HIGH/qmypmkelepr/chart.png
By one commonly used definition, a new bull market in the S&P 500 began when the index bounced from its March 23 low, supported by trillions of dollars in stimulus from U.S. policymakers that boosted hopes of a recovery from the deepest economic downturn since the Great Depression. 
Wall Street's dramatic bounce over the next five months saw the S&P gain some about 55% in the face of widespread economic devastation and a resurgence of the coronavirus pandemic in parts of the United States. 
In June, the Nasdaq became the first of the three major U.S. stock indexes to reclaim all-time highs, powered by gains in the shares of big technology-related companies that prospered during COVID-19 lockdowns, including Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) and Netflix Inc (O:NFLX). 
Commonly defined as a drop of 20% or more from a peak, the S&P 500 has seen about a dozen bear markets, or near-bear markets since the late 1960s, in most cases accompanied by a recession.
While 2020's bear market was the S&P 500's shortest-lived, it still packed a punch. The index fell 34% from its February high to its March low, just slightly below its average bear market loss of 37%. 
GRAPHIC: Deep dive - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/HIGH/gjnpwxnnwvw/chart.png

However, declines in the index's most recent bear market were not as deep as its two previous downturns. The 2009 bear market following the financial crisis destroyed 57% of the S&P 500's value, while the Wall Street slump in 2002 following the implosion of the dot-com bubble eliminated almost half of its value.

1178,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 18, 2020 04:40PM ET</span>",Detached from reality? Why U.S. stocks just hit a new high,"By David Randall and Saqib Iqbal Ahmed
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Has Wall Street missed the news that we are in a pandemic?
The U.S. economy remains battered by the coronavirus outbreak and Congress is deadlocked on another stimulus bill - yet the U.S. stock market just closed at a record high.
While it may seem that investors have failed to factor in any of the bad news weighing on most U.S. households, there are several key reasons why the stock market has recovered and could rally even higher.
On Tuesday, the S&P 500 (SPX) closed at 3,389.78, surpassing the closing high of 3,386.15 from Feb. 19 - confirming the end of the its shortest bear market in history. 
""Main Street lives for today, whereas Wall Street focuses on tomorrow,"" said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA. ""There's been a massive amount of monetary and fiscal stimulus... and there's a rising confidence that pharmaceutical firms are getting closer to a vaccine.""
Graphic: Don't fight the Fed - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/oakpemwabpr/Pasted%20image%201597154694695.png
The Federal Reserve kick-started the rebound into risk assets by pledging $3 trillion in unprecedented monetary support, going so far as to buy corporate bonds. That led to many investors repeating the mantra: ""Don't fight the Fed"" as they swooped in to follow the central bank's lead.
Fiscal aid from U.S. lawmakers helped the Fed's recovery efforts and further encouraged investors, as has the ability of many companies to beat expectations with their second-quarter earnings.
At the same time, bets that the Fed will keep interest rates at rock-bottom levels and stimulus flowing for the foreseeable future have pushed yields on some government bonds to record lows, driving money into equities.
""There’s a lot of money sloshing around in the system and a lot of it is finding a home in stocks,"" said Jeff Buchbinder, equity strategist for LPL Financial (NASDAQ:LPLA).
While U.S. growth took its worst hit since the Great Depression in the second quarter from coronavirus-fueled lockdowns, some market participants have been factoring in a comparatively speedy recovery, as seen in a jump in Citigroup’s Economic Surprise Index <.CESIUSD>. 
RALLY OR RISK AHEAD? 
After the sharp rally, investors are considering looming risks such as the upcoming U.S. presidential election, with some concerned that a contested result will create volatility across markets.
Valuations remain a concern. The S&P 500 (SPX) trades at 24.5 times forward earnings, a level last seen during the dot-com bubble two decades ago. Some worry there is still too much uncertainty over the trajectory of the pandemic and its impact on growth to justify those valuations.
""Much of the possible good news is already priced into markets, and valuations are starting to look stretched,"" wrote Bob Doll, senior portfolio manager at Nuveen.
Graphic: The real deal - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/yxmpjrdlbpr/Pasted%20image%201597153304210.png
Meanwhile, investors crowding in a cluster of technology and internet stocks that have come to dominate the S&P 500 have heightened concerns that the index may be vulnerable to sharp reversals if holders decide to sell all at once.
Just five stocks -  Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT), Apple Inc (O:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN), Google parent Alphabet Inc (O:GOOGL) and  Facebook Inc  (O:FB) - account for more than 22% of the market cap of the entire S&P 500 index. Last month, 74% of fund managers in a BofA Global Research survey said holding tech stocks is the market’s ""most crowded trade.""
The outsized rally has helped turn some previously bearish fund managers more bullish, with fund managers such as Guggenheim’s Scott Minerd predicting that stocks will continue to rise after the Nov. 3 presidential election, regardless of the winner. 
DoubleLine’s Jeffrey Gundlach is among the few well-known managers who have remained bearish, telling Reuters in late July that the equity rally led by a handful of large tech firms is ""classic bear market rally activity.""
More optimistic investors argue that tech-related stocks pull their share of the index's weight. While technology and communications stocks make up about 40% of the S&P 500's market capitalization, they also account for a similar share of its earnings. 
Tech stocks look increasingly attractive given historically low yields in the bond market that limit possible future returns, said LPL Financial's Buchbinder. 
While the scorching rally in tech sector stocks seen in the second quarter has eased somewhat this quarter, the sector continues to outperform the broad market. 
""The gap between the winners and losers is widening and the strong are getting stronger,"" he said.

Despite strong markets, Gold Futures is still a favorite as futures and spot prices rose, as is Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), which can't stop hitting records. Market optimism was also supported by data showing U.S. home building accelerated by the most in nearly four years in July.
Retailers from Walmart (NYSE:WMT) to the  Home Depot  (NYSE:HD) reported better-than-expected results on Tuesday, but the outlook did little to lift their fortunes. More retailers are on tap to report earnings this week.
Here are three things that may move markets tomorrow:
1. Tech earnings
Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is expected to report earnings per share of $1.98 on sales of $3.65 billion. The company has beat expectations over the past five quarters. 
 Analog Devices  (NASDAQ:ADI) is set to report earnings per share of $1.28 on sales of $1.43 billion. The stock is up about 46% since March.
2. Retail earnings 
Lowe's (NYSE:LOW) is up tomorrow after Home Depot reported its biggest sales bump in over 20 years today. Lowe's is estimated to report $2.83 on sales of $23.88 billion. Home Depot fell despite the good news, as stimulus dries up and reality hits.
TJX (NYSE:TJX) is expected to publish a loss per share of 11 cents on sales of $6.46 billion. Shares are up 63% since March.
 Target  (NYSE:TGT) may report earnings per share of $1.58 on sales of $19.87 billion. The stock is up 50% since March, and will follow Walmart's record online sales published Tuesday.
3. Fed minutes 
The minutes of the latest Federal Reserve meeting will be published in the afternoon. The wise words may provide some insight into how the central bank sees the recovery playing out, Reuters said. The Fed has cut rates to near zero to bolster business through the pandemic.

1180,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 18, 2020 04:05PM ET</span>","New York charges Teva, Allergan with insurance fraud over opioid claims","By Jonathan Stempel and Mrinalika Roy
NEW YORK (Reuters) - New York state filed civil charges on Tuesday accusing Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (NYSE:TEVA) Ltd and Allergan (NYSE:AGN) Plc with insurance fraud for downplaying the risks of their opioid painkillers to patients and doctors.
Governor Andrew Cuomo said the charges by New York's Department of Financial Services are the third this year in that regulator's opioid industry probe, following charges against Endo International (NASDAQ:ENDP) Plc and  Mallinckrodt  (NYSE:MNK) Plc.
Teva denied the allegations. Abbvie Inc, which bought Allergan in May, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
New York said Teva, which made 20% of opioids distributed from 2006 to 2014 in the state, intentionally marketed opioids such as Actiq for off-label use, and drafted form ""letters of medical necessity"" for doctors to boost prescriptions and insurer reimbursements.
It said Allergan misrepresented the safety of its drugs in marketing materials, citing a 2010 U.S. Food and Drug Administration warning letter over its Kadian pain treatment.
New York also accused Teva and Allergan of using ""front groups"" and doctors known as ""key opinion leaders"" to mislead people about the safety and effectiveness of opioids.
It cited the 2012 annual meeting of the New York Pain Society in White Plains, New York, where Allergan was a exhibitor. The state said a key opinion leader present downplayed addiction signs by promoting the concept of ""pseudoaddiction.""
Opioids have contributed to more than 400,000 deaths since 1997, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Cuomo called the nation's opioid crisis ""an American tragedy that has taken too many lives and caused irrevocable harm to communities,"" and he pledged to hold drugmakers accountable.
New York charged Teva and Allergan with violating two state insurance laws, with civil penalties of up to $5,000 per violation.

A hearing was scheduled for Oct. 26 at the financial services department's offices in Albany, New York.

Investing.com --  The S&P 500 closed at its highest ever, wiping out all losses since the coronavirus hit markets earlier this year. The Nasdaq also closed at a record, but the Dow couldn't pull off a win for a second day in a row.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 67 points, or 0.24% and the S&P 500 was up 0.22%. The Nasdaq Composite was up 0.73%.
The record high surpassed by the S&P 500 on Tuesday was last seen before the onset of the coronavirus crisis in February, with Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) taking the lead and rising more than 4%.   
Walmart (NYSE:WMT)'s online sales doubled in a record, but as stimulus money waned, revenue slowed and shares traded lower. The  Home Depot  (NYSE:HD) similarly reported terrific sales, but with the outlook uncertain, shares also fell. Retailer  Kohls Corp  (NYSE:KSS) got hammered on its outlook, despite better-than-expected results.
 Oracle Corp  (NYSE:ORCL) joined some of the investors of TikTok's Chinese owner, ByteDance, in pursuing a bid for the popular short-video app's operations in North America, Australia and New Zealand, Reuters said, citing people familiar with the matter.
Teva Pharma Industries Ltd ADR (NYSE:TEVA) fell after the U.S. government said it is suing the Israeli company for false claims.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) rose some more on Tuesday, rallying about 40% over the past week, since it approved a five-for-one stock split to make ownership more accessible. The split goes into effect Aug. 31.
Gold futures on Comex broke above $2,020 an ounce for the first time in a week, and futures and spot prices of the metal for immediate delivery rose about 1% each, adding to Monday’s gain of 2% or more.
Data on Tuesday showed U.S. home building accelerated by the most in nearly four years in July in the latest sign the housing sector is emerging as one of the few areas of strength in an economy suffering a record slowdown. That further added to market optimism.

The oil-to-telecoms conglomerate said (https://www.bseindia.com/xml-data/corpfiling/AttachLive/cd4afca2-0bb5-4744-8ccb-f37a05fa65f2.pdf) late on Tuesday its investment represents about 60% holding in Vitalic Health Pvt. Ltd. and 100% direct ownership of its subsidiaries. 
Vitalic and its subsidiaries, collectively known as Netmeds, were incorporated in 2015. Netmeds is a licensed e-pharma portal that offers authenticated prescription and over the counter (OTC) medicine along with other health products in India.
The COVID-19 crisis, which spurred a wave of online shopping, has led to increased competition between Amazon, Walmart-owned Flipkart, Reliance's upstart online grocery service, JioMart and a range of other smaller players for a share in the world's second most populous country.
India is yet to finalize regulations for online drug sales, or e-pharmacies, but growth of online sellers such as Medlife, Netmeds, Temasek-backed PharmEasy and Sequoia Capital-backed 1mg has threatened traditional drug stores. 
Many trader groups are against e-pharmacies, saying they would lead to sale of medicines without proper verification.

1183,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 18, 2020 03:18PM ET</span>",New York’s MTA Becomes Second to Tap Fed as Banks Demand Higher Yields,"(Bloomberg) -- The Federal Reserve bought $450.7 million of notes sold by New York’s Metropolitan Transportation Authority, making the beleaguered transit agency the second to borrow from the central bank’s $500 billion lending program for states and cities.
The Fed charged a true interest cost of 1.92%, “resulting in savings of over 85 basis points compared to the public market levels,” according to an emailed statement from MTA spokesperson Tim Minton.
The transit agency, bleeding cash because ridership is down amid the pandemic, turned to the Fed after rejecting the higher bids from Wall Street banks Tuesday, according to a notice by Grant Street, which runs an auction platform for municipal sales. The Fed had previously agreed to buy the debt that the MTA did not award to other bidders, according to documents released as part of the sale.
The central bank created the program earlier this year after the economic collapse from the pandemic rocked state and local government budgets and sent the $3.9 trillion municipal bond market into a tailspin. The Fed’s decision to act as lender of last resort arrested the steep sell-off in March by reassuring investors that the market wouldn’t be rocked by another liquidity crisis and even the hardest hit government agencies would still be able to raise funds.
Since then, though, it has only been used one other time, by Illinois, according to central bank data as of last week. That’s because the Fed is charging steep penalties at a time when most can borrow at the lowest rates in decades. The MTA’s offering was seen as a test of whether the Fed’s decision on Aug. 11 to lower prices on the loans would increase use of the program.
“This financing underscores again the MTA’s need for $12 billion of Federal funding to offset projected revenue losses through 2021,” MTA chief executive officer Patrick Foye said in an emailed statement on Tuesday.

The New York MTA, the largest U.S. transit system and among the agencies hardest hit financially by the coronavirus shutdowns, said it’s facing a $16.2 billion deficit related to the pandemic, according to documents associated with the debt sale.
It was seeking to borrow through cash-flow notes due in three years. Yet the weighted average true interest cost on bids submitted by the banks totaled about 2.79%, according to Grant Street. That’s far more than the market’s 3-year benchmark yield of about 0.12%, showing the level of risk investors are pricing into the securities.
The transit agency’s transportation revenue bonds are rated A2 by Moody’s Investors Service, A+ by Fitch Ratings, BBB+ by S&P Global Ratings, and AA+ by Kroll Bond Rating Agency, according to its website.

1184,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 18, 2020 02:55PM ET</span>","S&P 500 hits new intraday record, regaining pre-COVID levels","By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The S&P 500 climbed to a record on Tuesday, surpassing a level hit in February before the coronavirus crisis and crowning one of the most dramatic recoveries in the index's history.
Trillions of dollars in fiscal and monetary stimulus have made Wall Street flush with cash, pushing yield-seeking investors into equities. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and other high growth technology-related stocks have been viewed as the most reliable to ride out the crisis.
The S&P 500 rose as much as 0.4% to an all-time high of 3,395.06 points during the session. If the benchmark ends the session above its Feb. 19 record high close of 3,386.15, it would confirm that the index has been in a new bull market since hitting its pandemic low on March 23. It has surged about 55% since then.
Doubts about the underlying health of the economy, however, persisted in Tuesday's session, with lukewarm reactions to bumper results from  Home Depot  and Walmart (NYSE:WMT) limiting gains.
The S&P 500 flirted with all-time highs for several sessions before finally hitting a new record, raising questions about whether this run of gains could last.
""It begs the question whether the S&P will continue to make broader-based highs, not just in the technology space,"" said Keith Buchanan, portfolio manager at GLOBALT Investments in Atlanta. ""Is there enough participation outside of the technology to drive new highs?""
At 1:53 pm ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 7.31 points, or 0.03%, to 27,837.6, the S&P 500 gained 10.18 points, or 0.30%, to 3,392.17 and the Nasdaq Composite added 70.91 points, or 0.64%, to 11,200.64.
The tech-heavy Nasdaq index, which was the first to bounce back fully from March lows, hit a record high for the second consecutive session.
Consumer discretionary rose the most among major S&P sectors on strength in Amazon while technology stocks provided another major support to the benchmark index.
""Technology stocks continue to be the leaders ... that really hasn't changed from what we've been looking at over the past couple of months,"" said Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Asset Management in Chicago.
Home Depot Inc (NYSE:HD) reported its biggest rise in quarterly same-store sales in at least two decades, however, its shares fell about 1% after analysts cautioned that its sales might have hit their peak.

Walmart Inc traded marginally higher after posting its biggest-ever growth in online sales as shoppers cashed in stimulus checks and ordered everything from electronics and toys to groceries from the safety of their homes amid the COVID-19 pandemic.
Data on Tuesday showed U.S. homebuilding accelerated by the most in nearly four years in July in the latest sign the housing sector is emerging as one of the few areas of strength in an economy suffering a record slowdown. That further added to market optimism.
Minutes from the Federal Reserve's recent meeting due on Wednesday, meanwhile, may provide some insight into how the central bank sees the recovery playing out. The Fed has cut rates to near zero to bolster business through the pandemic.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.34-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.66-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

The S&P 500 posted 31 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 63 new highs and 16 new lows.

1185,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 18, 2020 02:55PM ET</span>","Algeria to allow private banks, airlines, sea transport firms","By Hamid Ould Ahmed
ALGIERS (Reuters) - Algeria will allow its private sector to set up banks as well as air and sea transport companies for goods and passengers to reduce spending, President Abdelmadjid Tebboune said on Tuesday.
The move is part of wider reforms by the OPEC member to cope with financial problems caused by a sharp fall in energy export revenues, the main source of state funding for the North African country.
Elected in December 2019, Tebboune wants to encourage private investors and improve the investment climate in an effort to develop the non-energy sector and reduce reliance on oil and gas.
""I see no objection to private investors creating air and sea freight and passenger transport (companies), as well as banks,"" he told a meeting in Algiers to discuss a plan to revive the economy.
The annual bill for goods transport services is estimated at $12.5 billion, he said.
""It is essential to find a solution to this situation,"" he told the meeting attended by government officials, businessmen and unions.
In the last decade, the judiciary ordered the liquidation of the country's first private bank and airline and sentenced their owner, Rafik Khalifa, to 18 years in prison on charges including fraud, corruption and falsifying administrative and banking documents.
Algeria's foreign exchange reserves have fallen to $57 billion from $62 billion in January, while energy export revenues are expected to reach $24 billion this year compared with $33 billion in 2019, Tebboune said.
Energy earnings currently account for 94% of total exports and the government aims to bring that figure to 80% from next year, while increasing the value of exports of non-energy products to $5 billion from $2 billion now, he added. 
To achieve that goal, the authorities will allocate 1,900 billion dinars ($14.84 billion) to help finance investment projects for the coming months.

""For investment, the doors are open. State banks are ready to help. But we want projects that create wealth and jobs and reduce imports,"" Tebboune said. ""There is no difference between the public and private sector.""

(Reuters) - NBCUniversal Vice Chairman Ron Meyer left the Comcast Corp (O:CMCSA)-owned company on Tuesday, after disclosing that he had made a settlement with a woman with whom he had a consensual affair years ago.
In a statement, Meyer said he had been the target of an extortion effort from people who learned of the settlement, which he said he had made under threat.
Meyer, who had been with the company for 25 years and is one of the most powerful figures in Hollywood, said ""parties learned of the settlement and have continuously attempted to extort me into paying them money or else they intended to falsely implicate NBCUniversal, which had nothing to do with this matter, and to publish false allegations about me."" 
He did not give details about the amount of the settlement, or when it was made.

In a statement, NBCUniversal Chief Executive Officer Jeff Shell (LON:RDSa) said: ""Late last week Ron Meyer informed NBCUniversal that he had acted in a manner which we believe is not consistent with our company policies or values. Based on Ron's disclosure of these actions, we have mutually concluded that Ron should leave the company, effective immediately.""

Kohl's executives also said they would take a conservative approach to the second half of 2020, as the company prepares for further markdowns and discounts ahead of the all-important holiday season.
""Back-to-school season has been impacted by the crisis as families navigate how their kids will return to school this year,"" Chief Executive Officer Michelle Gass said on the earnings call.
Retail giant Walmart Inc (N:WMT) also said back-to-school season has been ""choppy"", as more school districts rolled back their reopening plans.
U.S. department stores, which had been struggling to boost sales even before the pandemic, have had to sell products at lower prices and invest in their online businesses to keep pace with online-centric, off-price, and deeper-pocketed big-box retailers.
The Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin-based company's online sales increased 58% in the quarter, as it introduced curbside pick-up option, but the jump hurt its margins due to higher-than-expected shipping charges. 
Walmart also posted its biggest-ever growth in online sales as shoppers cashed-in stimulus checks and ordered everything from electronics and toys to groceries online.
Kohl's net sales declined 23% to $3.21 billion but beat estimates of $3.09 billion, helped by strong demand for kitchen electrics, toys, cookware and bedding.
Excluding items, the company lost 25 cents per share in the second quarter ended Aug. 1, smaller than estimates of an 83 cent loss, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Shares of the company have more than halved in value this year.

Investing.com -- Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) has rallied almost 40% over the past week. Why? It's 2020, why not?
To be fair, Tesla said a week ago that its board of directors had approved a five-for-one stock split to make ownership more accessible -- that goes into effect Aug. 31.
But going back farther, shares of the electric car maker have more than quadrupled for the year, and are up more than 3% on Tuesday.
While investors seem like they can't get enough, most analysts appear to be more cautious. Just four analysts have a buy rating on Tesla shares, while 13 say hold and 11 say sell. The average price target of $1,242.69 is about 16% lower than the current trading level.
On the face of it, recent news hasn't been much to celebrate. Tesla's new-car registrations in China fell month-over-month in July, with 11,456 vehicles registered in July, compared to 15,000 in June, according to Bloomberg.
But it's notable that the numbers have not been coming in with regularity this year: Registrations in China totaled more than 12,000 in March; 5,000 in April; and 11,000 in May. On top of that, the electric vehicle market in China is expected to see a compound annual growth rate of more than 30% from 2020 to 2028, according to Research Nester.
Wedbush analyst Dan Ives sees demand in China accelerating already in July and August, Barron's reported. In the third quarter, Tesla ""has seen strong demand in Europe and China with the U.S. market remaining softer,"" Ives said in a report on Monday.
There's plenty of competition, though, from old and new rivals. Canoo is the most recent company to go public. Canoo will use a membership model to sell its electric vehicles and will go public after it merges with  Hennessy Capital Acquisition Corp  IV Class A (NASDAQ:HCAC), a “blank-check” special purpose acquisition company created to finance a merger that often leads to an IPO, CNBC reported. Canoo will list with Nasdaq under the ticker CNOO. That will make it the fourth EV company to go public via a SPAC since March.
SoftBank may also have given the stock a boost when its new asset management unit reported a $123 million stake in Tesla, according to an SEC filing published Monday.

(Reuters) - The S&P 500 hit a record high on Tuesday, thanks largely to months of outperformance from Amazon (O:AMZN) and other heavyweight technology companies viewed by investors as likely to emerge from the coronavirus crisis stronger than smaller rivals. 
The widely followed index's most valuable companies have surged this year, with Apple (O:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Amazon each up between 33% and 72% year to date.
Graphic: Big Tech gets bigger Big Tech gets bigger https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/FANG/oakveogzyvr/chart.png 
 ABIOMED  (O:ABMD), Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (O:REGN) and West Pharmaceutical Services (N:WST), all involved in developing and selling therapies for the coronavirus, have risen over 50% since the S&P 500's previous record high in February. 
Trillions of dollars of monetary and economic stimulus aimed at reducing the economic fallout for tens of millions of Americans out of work because of the coronavirus have driven the S&P 500 up more than 50% from its March 23 low, with the benchmark now up nearly 5% for 2020.

While the pandemic has forced many restaurants and shops out of business, large supermarkets and retailers with strong online sales have grown. Thanks mostly to Amazon, the S&P 500 consumer discretionary index (SPLRCD) has gained 23% in 2020, making it the second-strongest performer among 11 sector indexes, below technology.
The information technology index (SPLRCT) has jumped 25% year to date, lifted by Microsoft, Apple, Mastercard (N:MA) and other companies seeing stronger demand for their products and services as people staying at home do more shopping online.
While some investors worry that the rally since March has been concentrated largely among tech companies, others have confidence that these stocks' gains are justified as the pandemic leads to a sharp increase in online shopping, cloud computing and other uses of technology.
""These are firms that have solid fundamentals that are superior to the broader market and will benefit from recent trends. We do not find that this high concentration is a source of systemic risk,” said Benjamin Jones, senior multi-asset strategist at  State Street  (NYSE:STT) Global Markets.

With the U.S. corporate earnings season mostly completed, a record number of companies have beaten dramatically lowered estimates. But the second quarter is still set to be the low point for earnings this year.
Even after a recent modest improvement in profit estimates, the S&P 500 is trading at about 22 times expected earnings, its highest multiple since the dot com era two decades ago.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Online retail brokerage TD Ameritrade Holding Corp (O:AMTD) said some of its thinkorswim desktop trading platform customers were unable to log on for a second-straight day, as the S&P 500 (SPX) hit a new all-time intraday high on Tuesday.
""We are currently experiencing a system issue impacting clients' ability to connect to the thinkorswim desktop platform. In the meantime, clients can access their accounts through thinkorswim Web, the thinkorswim mobile app and via all other TD Ameritrade platforms.

The Omaha, Nebraska-based company is in the process of being bought by rival  Charles Schwab  Corp (N:SCHW) in an all-stock deal that was valued at $26 billion when it was announced in November.
Retail participation in the equities markets has surged since March, as shares soared in response to government stimulus aimed at countering the coronavirus' economic impact. The surge also came as Main Street investors cheered the recent elimination of trading fees by most large online brokerages, including TD Ameritrade.

That flurry of trading helped S&P 500 touch a record of 3395.06 early on Tuesday, topping the high of 3,393.52 hit on Feb. 19.

Investing.com --  Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) jumped 11% after announcing a partnership with Rezdy that should increase its experience inventory. 
Rezdy, which operates a booking and distribution platform for tours, activities and attractions, is the first successful integration to the company’s recently launched API, Groupon Connect, that enables booking partners, reservation and ticketing platforms to directly connect their merchants to the Groupon platform. 
The move provides attractions operators with more control over their promotions by giving them the ability to sync their existing Rezdy booking capabilities with Groupon inventory. The partnership increases yield management capabilities for operators and allows customers to easily redeem Groupons.
“By providing a seamless and simple way for third-parties to connect directly to Groupon, we can quickly increase the amount of high-quality, bookable global inventory that we can offer in our local experiences marketplace,"" said Tim Eby, vice president of product at Groupon. 
Groupon reported results earlier this month that handily beat estimates. A loss per share of 93 cents compared to the expected loss of $2.75, and sales of $395.6 million bested the estimated $182.3 million.

1197,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 18, 2020 11:20AM ET</span>","Oracle joins bid for TikTok's U.S. operations, sources say","By Echo Wang and Joshua Franklin
(Reuters) -  Oracle Corp  (N:ORCL) has joined some of the investors of TikTok's Chinese owner, ByteDance, in pursuing a bid for the popular short-video app's operations in North America, Australia and New Zealand, according to people familiar with the matter. 
The move would represent a strategic departure for Oracle, which caters mostly to corporate customers and generates the bulk of its sales from cloud offerings and software licensing. 
Its co-founder and chairman Larry Ellison is one of the few top technology executive to openly support President Donald Trump, who has ordered ByteDance to divest TikTok amid concerns over the safety of the personal data of U.S. consumers.
Oracle is working with some of ByteDance's investors, including General Atlantic and Sequoia Capital, on making an offer for the TikTok assets that would challenge a rival bid from  Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT), the sources said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
ByteDance, TikTok, Oracle, General Atlantic and Sequoia declined to comment. The Financial Times first reported Oracle's interest in TikTok. 
Oracle shares were trading up 3.4% on the news on Tuesday morning, giving the company a market capitalization of $171 billion. 
 Twitter Inc  (N:TWTR) has also approached ByteDance to express interest in acquiring the U.S. operations of TikTok, though its chances are seen as remote because of its smaller size and the antitrust scrutiny for such a combination, sources said earlier this month.
Trump has said he would support an effort by Microsoft to buy TikTok's American operations if the U.S. government got a ""substantial portion"" of the proceeds, but has also said there are other interested potential buyers. He has given ByteDance 45 days to agree to a sale of TikTok, before transactions with either TikTok or ByteDance are prohibited. 

The White House has stepped up its efforts to purge what it deems ""untrusted"" Chinese apps from U.S. digital networks. Beyond TikTok, Trump has also issued an order that would prohibit transactions with Tencent Holding Ltd's (HK:0700) WeChat.

(Reuters) -  Home Depot  Inc (N:HD) reported its biggest rise in quarterly same-store sales in at least two decades on Tuesday as demand for paint, tools and lawn mowers surged from consumers stuck at home due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
The company's same-store sales jumped 23.4% in the second quarter, surging past analysts' average estimate of a 10.5% rise, as the home improvement chain emerged as one of the corporate winners during the pandemic.
Shares of Home Depot, however, fell about 1% in morning trading after analysts cautioned that its sales might have hit their peak.
""These are record comparable sales - it's really tough to sustain that,"" Wedbush Securities analyst Seth Basham said. ""We will see a slowdown in the back half of the year - the question is the degree to which the slowdown occurs.""
The company said it could not determine whether strong demand from earlier months would continue for the rest of the year, despite the U.S. housing market performing better than the broader economy.
People spending more time on do-it-yourself home projects such as painting and gardening pushed Home Depot's overall sales up 23.4% to a record $38.05 billion in the quarter ended Aug. 2. 
That resulted in the company's highest ever profit sharing payout to its hourly employees.
The company spent about $480 million in additional benefits, including weekly bonuses and overtime, to compensate workers required to work in stores and warehouses amid the health crisis.
Still, net income rose 24.5% to $4.33 billion, or $4.02 per share. Analysts had expected a profit of $3.71 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. [nCNWz4C6ya]
Shares of smaller rival Lowe's Cos Inc (N:LOW), which reports second-quarter results on Wednesday, were down marginally.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203) will offer its cars in India on leases or shorter-term subscriptions, hoping to tap growing demand for private transport as travelers cut down on communal journeys in the COVID-19 pandemic. 
The Japanese automaker said on Tuesday it would offer leasing plans to corporate and retail customers of three to five years across its portfolio of cars - including the Glanza hatchback, Yaris sedan and Fortuner sport-utility vehicle - for as little as 21,000 rupees ($281) a month.
Naveen Soni, senior vice president, sales and service at the carmaker's India unit, said the need for safe transport was growing and leasing or subscription models offered a more cost-effective solution than buying a car. 
So far, leasing and subscription services in India have largely focussed on the higher end of the auto market and therefore make up a fraction of the overall numbers, said Soni.
""The lower end of the market is where the bulk is,"" he said, adding that was where Toyota would also focus. 
Toyota's competitors in India, such as Maruti Suzuki (NS:MRTI) and  Hyundai Motor  Co (KS:005380), have formed partnerships to offer similar services, as carmakers look to boost revenues amid the pandemic.

Toyota's India unit has formed a separate team to drive the business and it will partner with its Japanese parent's global mobility services brand, KINTO, as well as ALD Automotive and SMAS Auto Leasing.

1200,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 18, 2020 10:55AM ET</span>",U.S. EV startup Canoo to go public at $2.4 billion valuation,"By Ben Klayman
DETROIT (Reuters) - Canoo Holdings Ltd, a U.S. electric vehicle startup already working with South Korea's  Hyundai Motor , will go public later this year at a value of $2.4 billion and aims to start delivering vehicles by the second quarter of 2022.
It has joined forces with a so-called special purpose acquisition company, or SPAC, and the combined company will be called Canoo Inc following the closing of the deal with  Hennessy Capital  Acquisition Corp IV  in the fourth quarter. It will trade on the Nasdaq under the ticker symbol ""CNOO,"" the companies said. 
Tuesday's announcement comes as investors are looking to ride the global shift to EVs and echo the surging stock price of segment leader Tesla (O:TSLA).
A SPAC is a shell company that raises money through an IPO to buy an operating entity, typically within two years.
""A SPAC has for us a huge advantage because we can generate enough funding to accelerate our development process,"" Ulrich Kranz, Canoo's co-founder and chief executive, told Reuters.
The former BMW (DE:BMWG) executive cited Hennessy's long track record, which includes taking school bus maker Blue Bird Corp (O:BLBD) public in 2015.
Hennessey CEO Daniel Hennessy said he looked at more than 12 EV startups and preferred Canoo's faster path to commercialization. 
The deal, including additional money from BlackRock Inc (N:BLK) and other institutional investors, will raise $607 million in proceeds. Hennessy raised $300 million in its March 2019 initial public offering.
Canoo has developed a ""skateboard"" - a low-rise platform that bundles batteries and electric motors with such chassis components as steering, brakes and wheels - on which a variety of vehicle body types can be built. 
Canoo projects 2024 revenue of $1.43 billion and its first profit at $188 million, officials said during a conference call.
In February, Canoo, based just outside Los Angeles, announced a deal to develop EVs with Hyundai Motor Co (KS:005380). Hyundai also has invested in UK electric van startup Arrival, another potential SPAC target.
The first of Canoo's lineup - the pod-like, seven-seat canoo - will be available via subscription to U.S. consumers starting in the second quarter of 2022, followed by a small commercial delivery vehicle in 2023 and a sport sedan in 2025, Kranz said. The canoo will have an electric driving range of more than 250 miles. 
Canoo expects to build 10,000 canoo vehicles in 2022, rising to 50,000 in 2024, the same annual rate it expects to reach for the delivery vehicle and sport sedan in 2026, officials said.
Canoo plans eventually to expand to China, Kranz said.
He added that Canoo will not have a dealer network and will offer monthly vehicle subscriptions bundled with maintenance, charging and access to insurance.
Canoo has a letter of intent and is in talks to finalize a deal for Canada's Magna International (TO:MG) to assemble its vehicles, Kranz said. Magna, which also may build vehicles for another EV startup, Fisker Inc, confirmed the talks.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened a tad higher on Tuesday but stronger-than-expected housing market data struggled to inject any real momentum, against a background of ongoing political uncertainty.
By 10:48 AM ET (1448 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 111 points, or 0.4%, at 27,733 . The S&P 500, which failed in an attempt to post a new record high on Monday, hit an intraday record on Tuesday and then turned negative, falling 0.1%, while the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.26%.
Earlier, the Census Bureau reported that U.S. housing starts had risen by 22% last month, their biggest monthly rise since 2016, to 1.496 million. That was well above analysts' forecasts for an increase to 1.24 million, as was a similar increase in building permits to 1.495 million.
Market participants took the numbers with a grain of salt, as analysts said they spoke to a surge in interest for single-family houses outside of major cities. As a result, city real estate prices may come under pressure, with attendant negative wealth effects on city home owners.
By the same token, the market also quickly shed its initial enthusiasm for Walmart (NYSE:WMT)'s quarterly earnings. seeing them as less an illustration of consumer strength, than as a result of consumers concentrating their spending in the few outlets that were allowed to remain open during lockdown. Walmart stock still rose 0.6%.
 Home Depot  (NYSE:HD) stock also reversed after trading higher in premarket on the back of results which beat expectations for both revenue and profit by over 20%. 
The bifurcation of the retail sector was again in evidence, though, as department store group Kohls reported a drop of nearly 25% in sales in the second quarter. While that was still above expectations and its net loss was also less than feared, Kohls stock still fell 14%, dragging down Macy’s (NYSE:M)stock and Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN) stock with it. 
There are still big question marks over the strength of U.S. consumer spending, given that some 30 million Americans are out of work and there is still no agreement in Washington, D.C., over how to go forward with enhanced unemployment assistance. On the plus side, the drop in new infections of Covid-19 across the U.S. in recent weeks is making it less and less likely that states will need to reintroduce economically damanging lockdown measures. The 35,000 new cases reported on Monday was the lowest such number since late June.
In other markets, gold returned above $2,000 as the dollar weakened to its lowest in 28 months against a basket of other major world currencies. The dollar also hit its lowest against the yuan since January, when the Chinese economy was the only wrestling with Covid-19.
Crude oil futures fell 1.0% to $42.45 ahead of the release at 4:30 PM of the American Petroleum Institute's weekly report on crude oil stocks."

(Reuters) - Walmart Inc (N:WMT) posted its biggest-ever growth in online sales on Tuesday as shoppers cashed in stimulus checks and ordered everything from electronics and toys to groceries from the safety of their homes amid the COVID-19 pandemic.
The near-doubling of online sales in the second quarter helped the retailer trounce Wall Street expectations for quarterly profit and same-store sales.
The results showed that the unprecedented spike in demand seen by big-box retailers at the peak of the coronavirus lockdowns has remained strong even as restrictions ease, with shoppers using their stimulus checks to shop for discretionary items like sneakers and clothes. This also helped Walmart reduce the number of markdowns or discounts.
However, as stimulus funds tapered off, sales at Walmart returned to normal, recording only a 4% rise in comparable sales in July. Shares were trading down marginally at $134.80 after hitting a record high in morning trading.
""The health crisis has created ... both tailwinds and headwinds to our business,"" said Chief Financial Officer Brett Biggs on a call with investors. ""In Q2, we saw stronger-than-expected sales due in large part to stock-up buying and stimulus spending, but the duration and extent of future government stimulus remains uncertain.""

BACK-TO-SCHOOL WOES
Walmart executives also said the back-to-school season has been ""choppy,"" as more school districts rolled back their reopening plans to curb the spread of coronavirus and shoppers had little-to-no need for backpacks and uniforms.
""Hinting at back-to-school being a little bit weaker or more spread out - and with no guidance - always gives investors an area of concern,"" said Randy Hare, portfolio manager at Huntington Private Bank, adding that shares might have traded higher had they done so.
Department store chain Kohl's (N:KSS) also pointed to softer trends for its back-to-school selling season due to the uncertainty around reopenings. Kohl's shares were down 12%.
Despite recording $1.5 billion in COVID-19 related expenses, that include higher wages and bonuses for employees, Walmart said its margins improved in the quarter, helped by stimulus checks that had consumers spending on bigger ticket items like home furnishings and apparel.
Walmart's online and grocery businesses have been bright spots, seeing rapid growth as it expands same-day delivery options and pick-up services.
Its U.S. online sales rose 97% in the quarter. Sales at U.S. stores open at least a year rose 9.3%, excluding fuel, in the quarter ended July 31.
""The e-commerce sales beat what we expected, yes,"" said Huntington's Hare. ""But big picture, companies positioned for curbside pickup and online sales are the ones that are going to benefit. Walmart is one of those companies.""
Walmart Plus, or Walmart+, touted as a rival to Amazon.com's (O:AMZN) Prime subscription, could upon its launch also be a way to attract new customers and turn them into loyal shoppers, analysts said.
Executives on Tuesday said it was still working towards the launch of the service.

Operating income rose 8.5% to $6.1 billion in the quarter, while adjusted earnings per share of $1.56 also topped the average estimate of $1.25.

 Kohls Corp  (NYSE:KSS) was getting hit the hardest on Tuesday, with shares tumbling 15.5% after dampening its outlook for the holiday season, even as it beat forecasts.

PARIS/LONDON (Reuters) -  Accor  (PA:ACCP) has been downgraded to junk status by ratings agency S&P Global, a decision set to cost the company around 30 millions euros in additional interest payments, as travel restrictions dim the outlook for the operator of Ibis and Sofitel hotels.
S&P cut Accor's credit rating to 'BB+' from 'BBB-' and left it with a negative outlook.
""We now anticipate weaker earnings and debt metrics in 2020 and 2021,"" S&P wrote, citing the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on travel and the economy in general.
The decision strips Accor of its investment grade status, even though it has a BBB- rating with Fitch, and means it will have to pay additional interest on some of its debt. 
A company spokeswoman confirmed there would be a so-called ""coupon step-up"" of 125 basis points on a number of its bonds with maturities spanning the February 2022 to February 2027 period.
This will mean Accor's interest bill will rise by around 30 million euros, most of which will occur in 2022, she said. 
It is not unusual for companies to include coupon step-ups to placate investors worried about a downgrade to junk, which can cause bonds to fall in value as they are booted out of widely-tracked investment-grade indices. 
The number of companies or countries at risk of having their credit ratings cut has been pushed to an all-time high by the pandemic, an S&P Global analysis showed in May.
Accor posted a first-half loss of 227 million euros and said it planned to cut 1,000 jobs as it seeks 200 million euros in annual cost savings.
Its shares were trading broadly flat at 1300 GMT, while some of its bonds jumped in anticipation of the extra coupon payments. The January 2024 bond rose 1.28 cents on the euro to a cash price of 97.99, its highest since mid-March.

1208,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 18, 2020 09:45AM ET</span>",Australia Agrees to Buy Oxford Virus Vaccine from AstraZeneca,"(Bloomberg) --
Australia has signed a letter of intent with AstraZeneca (NYSE:AZN) Plc to receive the University of Oxford’s coronavirus vaccine should it prove successful.
A future final agreement will include distribution, timing and the price of the vaccine, with hopes the university’s project may be able to deliver the first product by as soon as the end of this year. It would be manufactured in Australia.
The country is attempting to stifle a resurgence of the virus that’s mainly hit Victoria, the second-largest state, forcing its capital city Melbourne into a lockdown and other states to close their borders. That’s put pressure on Prime Minister Scott Morrison’s plan to lift the economy out of a crippling recession.
The deal with AstraZeneca is part of the Morrison’s government Covid-19 Vaccine and Treatment Strategy, which is being guided by medical and industry experts. The plan, expected to cost billions of dollars, includes a A$24.7 million ($17.9 million) contract with U.S. company Becton Dickinson (NYSE:BDX) & Co. for the supply of 100 million needles and syringes.
Separately, local biotechnology giant CSL (OTC:CSLLY) Ltd. was quoted in the government’s statement as saying while the University of Queensland’s vaccine candidate remains its priority, it was in talks with AstraZeneca and the government to assess whether it could also provide manufacturing support for the Oxford vaccine.
Australia has detected a total of 23,773 cases since the pandemic started, with 438 deaths. On Tuesday it announced 226 new daily cases, down from tallies in the 700s in late July.

1209,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 18, 2020 09:27AM ET</span>",Walmart Warns of Sales Pressure With End of Stimulus Checks,"(Bloomberg) -- Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc. has benefited from soaring online orders and a market-leading grocery business through the pandemic. But with federal stimulus checks no longer buoying consumer spending, tougher times could lie ahead.
The retailer’s comparable sales growth slowed last month as the impact of the government relief program waned, according to Chief Financial Officer Brett Biggs. A consumer survey from analysts at Stifel found that three out of four Americans have already spent a chunk of their stimulus checks.
“Comps were not as strong in July as stimulus dollars likely had been spent by then,” Biggs said Tuesday in an interview after the company reported second-quarter earnings. “Consumers are still spending money but not at pace they were in the middle of the quarter.”
Walmart, like other essential retailers who remained opened during the pandemic, has enjoyed a tailwind from stimulus checks that Americans started to receive in mid-April, which they spent on everything from bicycles to board games while stuck at home. But as Congress continues to debate the size and timing of further stimulus spending after the initial round ended last month, Walmart’s lower-income customers could get squeezed.
“The outsized gains experienced over the last few months may be starting to ebb,“ RBC Capital Markets analyst Scot Ciccarelli said in an note.
The slowing demand damped enthusiasm for an otherwise strong quarter, as comparable-store sales, a key indicator of retail performance, beat analysts’ estimates with an increase of 9.3% for U.S. Walmart stores. Revenue of $137.7 billion in the quarter ended July 31 also topped expectations.
The shares pared earlier gains and fell about 1% as of 9:20 a.m. in premarket trading in New York. Walmart gained 14% this year through Monday.
Online Sales
The retailer’s U.S. e-commerce sales rose 97% in the quarter, compared with the average analyst estimate of nearly 60%. The coronavirus has catalyzed online purchases, and Walmart has been a primary beneficiary thanks to its revamped website and a new partnership with Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) Inc. to bring more merchants into its fold. The retailer also recently merged its two main shopping apps in order to generate more non-food sales online.
“We started where we left off last quarter -- general merchandise continued to be really strong through the quarter,” Biggs said.
The world’s largest retailer is parlaying its low prices, ubiquitous store network and improved website to capture a big share of pandemic-fueled spending on food and other household essentials. It’s also looking to take a page from rival Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN).’s playbook by starting a subscription service later this year.
Walmart is planning to introduce the program, dubbed Walmart+, to help it hold onto the millions of new shoppers it has picked up during the pandemic. Chief Executive Officer Doug McMillon said on a conference call Tuesday that the company is nearing the launch and will share more information “when appropriate.”
Walmart said gross profit margins in the quarter widened by 63 basis points as it sold more non-food items that deliver better profits, with demand for those items fueled by government stimulus checks. But its operating expenses as a percentage of sales -- a key metric watched by investors -- increased in part due to $1.5 billion in Covid-related costs.
Restructuring Charge
The results include a $380 million charge for business restructuring, including layoffs. Walmart has been reorganizing its roughly 4,750 U.S. stores by reducing its corporate and field staff and consolidating divisions, Bloomberg News reported in July.
The retailer, which withdrew guidance in May, didn’t offer a fresh outlook on Tuesday due to uncertainty about the virus and the timing and scale of additional government stimulus spending.
Republican and Democratic negotiators remain at an impasse over renewed coronavirus relief. Federal Reserve officials and private economists have both emphasized that a sharp drop-off in government spending would hurt any U.S. recovery.
President Donald Trump on Aug. 8 signed orders that extend supplementary unemployment insurance payments and offered employers a deferral on collection of payroll taxes. Still, estimates of their impact are just a fraction of the $1 trillion stimulus package proposed by Republicans, let alone the $3.4 trillion relief proposed by Democrats.

1210,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 18, 2020 09:25AM ET</span>",New U.S. curbs threaten Huawei's smartphone crown and hit suppliers,"By Josh Horwitz and Hyunjoo Jin
SHANGHAI/SEOUL (Reuters) - Ramped-up U.S. restrictions on Huawei are likely to choke the Chinese company's access to even off-the-shelf chips, threaten its crown as the world's largest smartphone maker and disrupt global tech supply, executives and experts warned. 
The Trump administration expanded its curbs on Huawei on Monday and banned suppliers from selling chips made using U.S. technology to the firm without a special license - closing potential loopholes in its May sanctions that could have let Huawei access the tech via third parties.
The curbs underscore the growing rift in Sino-U.S. ties as Washington presses governments to squeeze Huawei out, alleging the company would hand over data to Beijing for spying. Huawei denies it spies for China.
""If the choking of Huawei continues there will be reverberations across the semiconductor complex,"" said Neil Campling, head of TMT research at Mirabaud Securities. ""And the retaliation from China remains unknown and a significant risk.""
The tech giant's business has suffered since America first blacklisted it a year ago. 
If Huawei cannot source chipsets as a result of the expanded curbs, its ""handset business will likely disappear"", Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) said in a note.
Other brokerages, including JP Morgan, echoed that view, adding this would give players such as  Xiaomi  (HK:1810) and Apple (O:AAPL) an opportunity to increase their market share.
Huawei did not respond to requests for a comment.
Earlier this month, Huawei flagged it would stop making its flagship Kirin chipsets from September because U.S. pressure on its suppliers had made it impossible for its HiSilicon division to keep making the chipsets that are key components in mobile phones.
Huawei's HiSilicon division has relied on software from U.S. companies such as Synopsys (O:SNPS) to design its chips. It outsourced the production to Taiwanese contract chipmaker TSMC (TW:2330) (N:TSM), which uses equipment from U.S. companies.
IMPACT ON CHIP SUPPLIERS
The U.S. ban represents a setback for chip suppliers too, at least in the near term, as they have to apply for licences that comply with the new rules, experts said. 
It is yet unclear how many suppliers require these licences and whether they will get them. 
In Asia, memory chipmakers including South Korea's Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) and SK Hynix (KS:000660), Japanese image sensor maker Sony (T:6758) and Taiwanese chipset maker MediaTek (TW:2454) may be affected, a chip industry source said.
Shares in MediaTek, which counts Huawei as a major customer, slumped 10% on Tuesday.
MediaTek said it was monitoring new developments of rules to remain in compliance, but that it did not expect a material impact to near-term operations, based on available information.
In Europe, German chipmaker Infineon (DE:IFXGn), which counts Huawei as a key customer for its power management products, and Austrian sensor specialist ams (VI:AMS) said they were reviewing the impact of the latest U.S. restrictions.
European tech stocks were firmer, however, reflecting their relatively low exposure to Huawei, which accounts for 7% of sales at ams, 3% at Infineon and 4% at STMicroelectronics, according to figures cited by Mirabaud's Campling.
WHO WILL BE THE WINNERS?
Several questions remain about the how the new curbs will be implemented, and how hawkish a stance Washington plans to take.
For example, a semiconductor vendor would ""potentially be required to know where all its products end up so they do not engage in any transaction where a Huawei affiliate might be a purchaser, intermediate consignee, ultimate consignee or end-user"", political risk consultant Eurasia Group said in a note.
But there are likely to be some winners in the longer term if Huawei is forced to relinquish its spot as the world's largest smartphone maker.
""Huawei currently has 45-50% market share in China and, if this becomes vulnerable, Xiaomi, along with Oppo and Vivo, are likely to be the biggest beneficiaries,"" JP Morgan analyst Gokul Hariharan said, referring to Chinese smartphone makers.
""Huawei would also be likely to lose further ground in the international smartphone space and 5G base stations, both of which could benefit Samsung. The Apple food chain could also benefit from potential iPhone share gains.""
TSMC, which has said it would not ship wafers to Huawei after Sept. 15, will be slightly hurt in the long run, Bernstein said in a note. ""TSMC is 'everybody's foundry' eventually.""

The ban is also likely to affect U.S. chipmakers such as Qualcomm (O:QCOM), but those losses are likely to be offset in the longer term as Huawei's rivals gain ground, analysts said.

HELSINKI/BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Nokia's (HE:NOKIA) fight with  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) over patent licensing fees won backing from a German court on Tuesday after the judge said the carmaker had not made a serious attempt to resolve the issue with the Finnish company.
The spat highlights a wider battle between tech companies and the car industry over royalties for technologies used in navigation systems, vehicle communications and self-driving cars.
The issues are crucial for Nokia, which makes 1.4 billion euros ($1.67 billion) in licensing revenues every year.
The Mannheim court in Germany said neither Daimler nor other parties involved in the case were ""seriously prepared or ready to conclude a license agreement"" with Nokia on fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory (FRAND) terms.
The same court however ruled against Nokia in the first patent case in February. There are eight more lawsuits pending in the German courts, with the third case scheduled for Sept. 5.
Following Tuesday's judgment, the company can enforce a sales ban against Daimler but this would require it posting a 7-billion-euro bond as a guarantee to cover any damages in the event the ban is overturned on appeal, making such a move unlikely.
Daimler said it did not understand how the court could come to this conclusion and that it would appeal.
Nokia said the court confirmed it had acted in a fair way in licensing its cellular standard-essential patents (SEPs), and that Daimler was using Nokia technologies without authorisation.
""We hope that Daimler will now accept its obligations and take a license on fair terms,"" Jenni Lukander, president of Nokia Technologies, said in a statement.
Continental (DE:CONG), which intervened in the case, criticised the judgment.
""It is precisely such a licence agreement that Continental has long been demanding from Nokia and which it is currently requesting in court in the USA from Nokia,"" the company said in a statement.
The court also rejected a suggestion from the German cartel office that the case should be referred to Europe's highest court in Luxembourg, saying it did not consider it appropriate.

1212,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 18, 2020 09:06AM ET</span>",Work-from-home boom is a bust for big office furniture makers,"By Timothy Aeppel
(Reuters) - America's biggest office furniture manufacturers got the rug pulled out from under them by the COVID-19 pandemic.
For decades, producers like  Herman Miller  Inc (O:MLHR) and  Steelcase Inc  (N:SCS) focused on selling through their own dealers to companies that bought ergonomic chairs and desks by the truckload and employed teams of designers and technicians to deliver and install them. None of them were prepared for a flood of orders for a single adjustable desk from stay-at-home workers suddenly trying to figure out how to conduct Zoom meetings from spare bedrooms.
Early in the pandemic in late April, 52% of employed Americans said they were always working from home to avoid catching or spreading the coronavirus, while another 18% reported sometimes working from home, according to a survey by Gallup. A later survey found half said they'd like to continue doing this permanently--including 27% who cited both a preference for remote work and fear of the coronavirus.
When Alphabet Inc's (O:GOOGL) Google told employees in May the company would reimburse up to $1,000 to outfit home offices, most of the options they found were inexpensive imports sold by big box stores or Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).
""A Tsunami hit this industry with this pandemic,"" said Ron Wiener, chief executive of iMovR, a maker of adjustable desks in Seattle. ""The big companies simply weren't structured to serve people from home.""
Steelcase, the largest U.S. office furniture maker, and Herman Miller, the No. 2 producer, both reported steep losses and double-digit sales declines in the three months ending in May. For Steelcase, sales of about $483 million were the lowest since its initial public offering in 1998.
Investors have figured out just how dire their situations have become as some experts predict the virus will largely kill off large offices as more companies find they can operate with workers dispersed, saving on costly real estate. 
Even as the wider stock market has nearly recovered all of its losses from the early days of the outbreak, shares of Steelcase and Herman Miller remain deep in the red. Steelcase shares fell 69% from their 52-week high after the pandemic hit - and are still off 51%. Shares of Herman Miller fell over 71% and are still down over 50%. 
Herman Miller and others say they've made strides in expanding their online options since the pandemic hit and have found other ways to sell to individuals.
Lori Gee, vice president of workplace performance services at the Zeeland, Michigan-based company, said they quickly set up a way for Google employees to buy directly from the company, for instance. 
""Part of this has been an acceleration of what we were already doing - to make it easier to get the best set up,"" regardless of where the furniture would go or the size of the order.
HIGH PRICES, LOGISTICS CHALLENGES
Manufacturers of many other goods have pivoted to new products, including things needed to fight the pandemic, or stepped up services to make up for other lost business. 
Office furniture makers have had a harder time, in large part because of logistical challenges. The average work-at-home customer, for instance, wants a product that can be sent by a delivery service in a single box and can be easily assembled - ideally without needing special tools. 
Price is also a factor. An Aeron chair, a classic design sold by Herman Miller, comes in versions that can easily cost $1,000. Workstations in offices can cost even more, depending on their complexity and added features, such as adjustable desktops and built-in arms to hold computer monitors. Workers stuck at home are far less likely to splurge on such expensive options, at least in part because many are worried about keeping their jobs.
The way big companies make their products is a complicating factor. Many producers have outsourced component production, buying bases from one company, for instance, desktops from another, and assembling them into configurations according to the design laid out for a large operation.
""We're not used to dealing with the end user - if we get a call from a customer about a missing screw, we're not set up to handle that,"" said Soren Stig-Nielsen, president of LINAK U.S. Inc., the U.S. division of a Danish company that makes many of the world's actuators for lifting bases on desks to adjust height. The company has a large factory in Louisville, Kentucky, and sells its equipment to most of the big domestic furniture companies, including Steelcase.
""COVID has created huge demand in the home office area,"" said Stig-Nielsen, ""and traditionally we have not been a big player in that market.""
Meanwhile, the industry is not giving up on actual offices. 
Herman Miller's Gee said it is unclear how long the slump in building new centralized offices will continue. But she said the company's designers are already working on concepts for a new style of working, including more ""small, satellite offices"" that they believe companies will want to set up to serve workers more widely dispersed than in the past.

""We think there will always be the need for a physical workplace - places where you go for collaboration and bring to life the corporate culture,"" Gee said.

1214,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 18, 2020 08:54AM ET</span>",Bank of America Clients With $489 Billion Finally Trust This Bull Market,"(Bloomberg) -- It took unprecedented stimulus and a rally that’s pushed equities near record highs, but fund managers overseeing $489 billion finally believe that this stock market recovery has legs.
Among investors surveyed by Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC). in the week through Aug. 13, 46% described equities as being in a bull market, up from 40% in July. The share of skeptics who say it’s a “bear market rally” has dropped to 35% from 47% a month earlier. There are more signs of optimism: 79% of investors expect a stronger economy, the most upbeat result since December 2009, while 57% are betting on higher profits.
The survey comes at a crucial time for equity market investors as the S&P 500 flirts with record-high levels and many participants mull whether it’s time to take profits or push for more returns. BofA strategists said that while this is the most bullish monthly fund manager survey since February, it’s not yet a red flag.
“We do not think positioning is dangerously bullish,” said strategists led by Michael Hartnett. September is expected to bring market volatility amid concerns that U.S. stimulus has peaked, but a “disorderly drop” in credit and stocks would require a “disorderly” increase in rates, according to BofA.
On top of the powerful stimulus measures, expectations of a Covid-19 vaccine have added to forces driving equities higher in recent weeks. The latest BofA survey shows that fund managers expect a vaccine announcement to happen early in the first quarter of 2021.
To be sure, not all investor expectations are rosy. Only 17% forecast a quick, V-shaped economic bounce, compared with 37% who expect a W-shaped recovery that will come in stages.
The August survey also showed a rotation toward euro-area and emerging-market equities compared with July. The euro-area is now the most popular equity region among the poll’s respondents, with their allocation increasing 17 percentage points to a 33% overweight, the highest since May 2018. In contrast, the exposure to U.S. stocks declined 5 percentage points to net 16% overweight.

1215,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 18, 2020 08:35AM ET</span>",Australia signs deal with AstraZeneca for possible COVID-19 vaccine,"By Colin Packham
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia has signed a deal with drugmaker AstraZeneca (NYSE:AZN) to secure a potential COVID-19 vaccine, the Prime Minister said on Tuesday, joining a growing list of countries lining up supplies of the drug.
AstraZeneca’s candidate is seen as a frontrunner in the global race to deliver an effective vaccine against the coronavirus that has killed more than 770,000 people and infected nearly 22 million, according to a Reuters tally.
With several countries moving to secure supplies that some fear may lead to a global shortage, Australia said it had signed a letter of intent with AstraZeneca to produce and distribute enough doses for its population.
""Under this deal we have secured early access for every Australian,"" Prime Minister Scott Morrison said in an emailed statement.
""If this vaccine proves successful we will manufacture and supply vaccines straight away under our own steam and make it free for 25 million Australians.""
Countries around the world are looking to secure supplies of  Astrazeneca  (LON:AZN)'s potential vaccine. Most recently Argentina and Mexico said last week they would produce it for much of Latin America. 
Morrison, however, cautioned that while AstraZeneca's candidate is showing early promise, there was no guarantee it would materialise as an effective tool in preventing COVID-19.
Once heralded as a global leader in combating COVID-19, Australia has seen a surge of new infections in the past month. Yet its tally of nearly 24,000 cases and 438 deaths is still far fewer than many other developed nations.
Morrison said Australia is also committed to ensuring early access to a vaccine for Pacific countries, which are increasingly wooed by China, much to Canberra's concern.
Earlier, Australia's biggest biotech company CSL (OTC:CSLLY) Ltd said it was in talks with AstraZeneca to determine if the potential COVID-19 vaccine being developed by the British drugmaker could be manufactured locally.
In addition to pressing ahead with securing a potential vaccine, Australia said it had also signed a A$24.7 million ($17.9 million) deal with U.S. medical technology company Becton Dickinson (NYSE:BDX) to buy 100 million needles and syringes.

LONDON (Reuters) - Europe's blue-chip stocks rebounded on Tuesday, helped by gains for COVID-19-hit sectors such as travel and leisure, while the dollar slid on concern further U.S. fiscal stimulus could face political deadlock.
Despite the large amounts of recovery money sloshing around the system, the gains were cautious in thin holiday trade, with markets mindful of an escalating geopolitical tussle between China and the United States. 
The reversal from early lows for the region's blue-chip euro STOXX 50, up 0.5%, was mirrored in U.S. stock futures, which rose 0.2%. That suggested Wall Street's broadest equity gauge could inch closer to a fresh record high, a day after a its sister index the Nasdaq hit its own milestone.
The early European weakness had followed a mixed picture in Asia overnight after a fresh instalment in the escalating spat between the United States and China. 
Amid concern about the close ties between Beijing and Huawei Technologies Co, U.S. President Donald Trump announced further restrictions on the maker of mobile phones and other technology. He is seeking to limit the tech giant's access to commercially available chips, a move that is likely to disrupt global supply chains. 
The early sea of red for European equities soon turned green, however, with German, Italian and Spanish stocks gaining 0.6%-0.9%, led by sectors including autos and the travel and leisure sector.
Britain's blue-chip FTSE 100, the region's biggest equity market, was also higher by late morning, up 0.4% but held back slightly by miner BHP Group (NYSE:BHP), which missed on profits and warned on slowing global growth.
One of those backing further gains for equity markets was Mark Hafaele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management.
""We emphasize a positive outlook for risk assets, but advise investors that they may need to adjust their strategies to optimize their portfolio for the next phase of the recovery,"" he said in a note to clients.
""Adding risk exposure with markets at or near all-time highs can be daunting, but studies continue to show that time in the market is far more important than timing the market.""
Investors had to balance the moves against Huawei with Trump's comments that China was meeting its obligations under the trade deal, pushing the Chinese currency to a more than five-month high against the greenback.
In other currency markets, the overarching theme was broadening dollar weakness, which weighed on European government bond yields and lifted the prices of alternative safe-haven assets such as gold.
The latest blow to the struggling dollar came from disappointing manufacturing and mortgage data, which led the greenback to hit a fresh 5-1/2 year low against the Swiss franc. It also neared a two-year low against a basket of its rivals, hit earlier this month. [FRX/] 
In bonds, benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasuries were last down around 1 basis point at 0.6752. In Europe, German government bond yields held steady at a three-day low, ahead of flash PMI activity surveys on Friday.
In commodities, oil prices edged lower, giving up a slice of their recent gains after OPEC+ said the producer grouping was almost fully complying with output cuts. 
Brent crude was down 15 cents, or 0.3%, at $45.22 a barrel, after gaining 1.3% on Monday. U.S. crude was down 0.5%, at $42.68 a barrel, having risen 2.1% in the previous session
Safe-haven gold closed higher after Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) also disclosed a stake in Toronto-based Barrick Gold (NYSE:GOLD) Corp, one of the world's largest mining companies.
Spot gold added 1.1% to once again breach the $2,000 an ounce barrier, trading at $2,007 an ounce.

1217,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 18, 2020 08:20AM ET</span>",U.S. activists complain that virtual shareholder meetings let companies silence them,"By Jessica DiNapoli and Ross Kerber
NEW YORK/BOSTON (Reuters) - Justin Danhof has used annual shareholder meetings to question companies on social issues for the last nine years. 
His conservative think tank, the National Center for Public Policy Research, owns just a few shares in each of about 150 companies and takes advantage of its shareholder status to grill executives on issues ranging from gay rights to boardroom diversity. 
This year, Danhof often found himself ignored, as companies held their shareholder meetings remotely during the COVID-19 pandemic, and asked investors to submit their questions online. Danhof said his questions on topics such as companies' dealings with China or restrictions on financing gun makers were answered in only 13 of the 27 virtual shareholder meetings he and his representatives attended. 
""Companies used the crisis to set up question-and-answer sessions that are a joke,"" Danhof said. His success rate was much higher when he could sit near a microphone or in a CEO's line of sight during in-person gatherings, he added. 
Danhof is not alone. Investors faced obstacles, such as not being able to ask questions or not having their inquiries addressed, about 55% of the time in a sample of 88 virtual shareholder meetings held this year and reviewed in a Hebrew University of Jerusalem study published this month. 
The researchers did not provide such figures for in-person shareholder gatherings in previous years but estimated that this year's virtual meetings had significantly increased the number of dodged questions.
To be sure, virtual shareholder meetings have been welcomed by many mom-and-pop investors, who would have otherwise had to travel to a company's headquarters to attend amid the pandemic.
 Broadridge Financial Solutions  (NYSE:BR) Inc, the top technology vendor to companies for these events, said it helped run 1,494 virtual shareholder meetings this year, up from 326 last year, preserving a key ritual in the corporate calendar. 
Yet many activists focused on environmental, social and corporate governance issues say the digital format can make it hard for them to hold companies accountable, given that Wall Street's big institutional investors get access to top executives all year long. 
""Companies should not use the pandemic as a cover for silencing their investors,"" New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli, who administers the state's roughly $194 billion pension fund, said in a statement to Reuters. He said he wanted companies to use virtual meetings as a supplement to in-person shareholder gatherings, not a replacement.
Questions avoided this year ranged from online auctioneer eBay Inc (NASDAQ:EBAY) declining to name directors who did not attend its online meeting to drug maker  AbbVie Inc  (NYSE:ABBV) avoiding an inquiry on whether it would raise the cost of drugs during the pandemic. 
""As long-term investors, we were disappointed our question wasn't answered by AbbVie,"" said Kate Monahan, shareholder engagement manager at the Friends Fiduciary Corporation, which invests roughly $480 million based on religious Quaker values.
She said she also posted her question on social media to attract attention but has yet to receive an answer from AbbVie. 
Abbvie did not respond to a request for comment. An eBay spokeswoman said the company's shareholder meeting was well attended by its board, and that it focused on questions more relevant to its business ""out of fairness to other shareholders.""
Shareholder advocacy groups, including the Council of Institutional Investors (CII), last month asked the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to look into the issue, including companies avoiding questions or not allowing shareholders to speak during virtual meetings. 
An SEC spokesman declined to comment. The securities regulator issued guidance in April instructing companies to be clear about how shareholders ""can remotely access, participate in, and vote"" in online meetings. 
The New York State Common Retirement Fund, overseen by DiNapoli, voted against the re-election of directors sitting on the governance committees of AT&T Inc and Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) Inc's boards this year for restricting investor participation at their virtual meetings.
Berkshire Hathaway did not respond to requests for comment. An AT&T spokeswoman said via e-mail that its decision this year to tweak the format of its shareholder meeting, allowing the company to read comments on proxy proponents' behalf, ""lets us efficiently address the matters to be voted and then move on to additional content."" 
A spokesman for the fund said it will vote against directors of companies that do not meet CII's standards for virtual shareholder meetings. 
Proxy advisory firm Glass, Lewis & Co, which many funds turn to for advice on how to cast their shareholder votes, is considering recommending against directors at companies that ran this year's virtual meetings poorly, its head of research and engagement Aaron Bertinetti said. 
TECHNICAL GLITCHES 
The snubbing of the activists has not always been intentional. As the pandemic spread in the spring, some companies had to switch to virtual meetings with little notice, resulting in technical glitches. 
""The technology is just catching up with the need to make virtual meetings the best in class,"" said Lawrence Elbaum, a partner at law firm Vinson & Elkins LLP, who often works with companies challenged by activists. He added that investors can also contact companies through investor relations and by writing letters any day of the year. 
Some activists argued, however, that public pressure on companies at shareholder meetings is more successful in triggering change. They pointed to oil major ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) Corp’s move in 2018 to provide investors with a report on the impact of climate change after shareholders won a high-profile vote at its annual meeting the previous year. 

""Virtual meetings provide another tool for companies who don't like dissent to shut it down,"" said Doug Chia, the president of corporate governance consulting firm Soundboard Governance LLC.

1219,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 18, 2020 07:55AM ET</span>",The $425 billion payment holiday question hanging over Europe's banks,"PARIS (Reuters) - More than 360 billion euros ($425 billion) of loans at Europe's biggest banks have been subject to payment breaks or other coronavirus relief measures but the big question is whether borrowers will be able to resume payments when support ends. 
At the direction of governments and regulators, lenders have granted millions of consumers and companies breathing space to help them deal with the financial fallout from the pandemic. 
But determining what proportion of loans might go bad when relief measures end, and in turn the degree to which banks' will suffer losses, is not straightforward. 
Figures from the seven biggest European banks that provided data on their relief measures at the end of the second quarter show the value of outstanding loans subject to some kind of moratorium is around 15 times the size of the total provisions set aside for loan losses. 
Graphic: Payment holidays in focus https://graphics.reuters.com/HEALTH-CORONAVIRUS/PAYMENT/azgvokqoyvd/chart.png
European regulators have said banks do not automatically have to set aside money to cover loans subject to payment breaks if they have a degree of confidence normal payments will resume, but that is proving hard to assess. 
Thomas Verdin, Bank & Regulation Director at BM&A, an independent audit and consulting firm, noted that some clients not in financial difficulty had requested short-term relief as a precautionary measure. 
""You don't know if the volumes of loans under moratoria is a signal of financial difficulties,"" he said. 
Although second quarter earnings calls were dominated by questions on the impact of loan moratoria, banks said there were few signs of stress where payment holidays had already ended. 
Santander (MC:SAN) said around 116 billion euros of loans had been subject to some kind of payment break. Moratoria on around a third of that volume had expired by July 15, with the vast majority of such loans still performing. 
However, borrowers who opt not to extend payment holidays are those likely to be in a stronger financial position. 
In Britain, initial offers of three-month payment breaks have already been extended once, with most now due to end in autumn.
Lloyds Banking Group (LON:LLOY), Britain's biggest mortgage lender, has said it's only in the next few months that they will get ""get a clearer picture of the underlying situation"". 
Italy's biggest bank UniCredit (MI:CRDI) said that while it had made broad provision for loans subject to moratoria, it would likely not be able to make specific provisions until next year. 
But as a clearer picture emerges of the economic fallout from the crisis, the pressure on banks for clearer provisioning will grow.
""The timely classification and measurement of credit risk is critical for banks to provide confidence to supervisors and their stakeholders,"" the Financial Stability Institute (FSI) of the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) said a paper in May.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are set to open higher Tuesday, with investors confident about the strength of the U.S. economic recovery, helped by strong earnings from retail giants  Home Depot  (NYSE:HD) and Walmart (NYSE:WMT).
At 7:15 AM ET (1115 GMT), S&P 500 futures traded 6 points, or 0.2%, higher, the Dow futures contract was up 99 points, or 0.4%, while Nasdaq 100 futures gained 38 points, or 0.3%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average cash index declined 0.3% Monday, while the S&P 500 index climbed 0.3%, to the verge of its record close, and the Nasdaq Composite index climbed 1%, to a record closing high.
Investors are at their ""most bullish"" on financial markets since February, when world stocks hit a record high, a Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) fund manager survey showed Tuesday.
Of the 181 survey participants, who manage half-a-trillion dollars in assets, a net 79% expect a stronger economy, the strongest reading since December 2009. The majority now believe that stocks are now in a new bull market, rather than a bear market rally.
Both Home Depot and Walmart set an upbeat tone ahead of a slew of business updates from major retailers.
Home Depot stock rose 2.4% in premarket trade, after its quarterly comparable same-store sales soared 23%, while Walmart gained 6% premarket after posting its biggest-ever growth in online sales.
Helping this confidence has been the expectation that the U.S. economy will benefit from a new stimulus plan in the near future. This had started to look unlikely as the two political sides refused to compromise around the size and scope of the new bill, but Senate Republicans now plan to introduce a scaled-back stimulus bill, according to Politico.
The Democrats have resisted the passing of a piecemeal bill, and are currently involved in their national convention. But they are due back in Washington on Saturday and this could be the starting point for new discussions, Politico argued.
Elsewhere, looking at economic data, housing starts are expected to have posted a third straight monthly gain to 1.24 million in July, while building permits are expected to rise to 1.32 million.
Oil prices traded in a tight range Tuesday, but near five-month highs, as the market awaited the American Petroleum Institute’s crude oil stocks update, due later in the day, and then Wednesday’s OPEC+ joint ministerial monitoring committee meeting.  
OPEC+, which consists of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, tapered their agreed output cuts to 7.7 million barrels per day in August from 9.7 million barrels per day previously, as prices started picking up.
U.S. crude futures traded 0.4% lower at $42.71 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract fell 0.2% to $45.27. 
Elsewhere, gold futures rose 0.7% to $2,013.60/oz, helped above the $2,000 level again by a weaker dollar, with EUR/USD 0.3% higher at 1.1901.

1223,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 18, 2020 06:45AM ET</span>",Tech-fuelled 'everything's awesome' rally looks unstoppable,"By Saikat Chatterjee and Thyagaraju Adinarayan
LONDON (Reuters) - Today's $72 trillion question for investors: To buy or not to buy into the global equities rally? Notwithstanding inflated share prices, politics and the pandemic, the answer from many is a resounding ""yes.""
That's not just because unprecedented stimulus - $20 trillion and counting - is forcing a structural change in how financial assets are valued.
It's also down to years of societal shifts, innovation and now, the pandemic, which could transform forever the way people work, study and shop - playing into the dominant hand of tech stocks.
So while renewed coronavirus outbreaks and looming U.S. elections have made some investors cautious, many equity bulls are hanging in there, having already boosted the value of stocks globally by $24 trillion since end-March.
As global equities near record highs, strategists say the quickfire bear-to-bull switch was not only justified but deserves to go further.
""The COVID pandemic has taken existing trends – greater dependency on tech, online shopping, remote working, etc. – and supercharged them,"" said Benjamin Jones, a senior multi-asset strategist at  State Street  (NYSE:STT) Global Markets.
With technology stocks holding on to their eye-popping gains, investors say the next leg of the rally is likely to come from value stocks - so called because they trade at cheaper valuations than their growth-oriented peers.
Stocks are benefiting of course from above-average equity-risk premiums, the return one can earn by holding stocks compared with risk-free assets. Global stocks carry an ERP of 4.6%, while for U.S. stocks, it's at 4%.
That might erode over time, but for now interest rates appear firmly stapled to the floor. 
As for valuations, they are hovering near 22 times forward earnings for the U.S. S&P 500 index (SPX), the highest since the dotcom bubble in early 2000. But then, the index too has changed dramatically with technology by far its biggest sector component.
Making up around a third of the benchmark index, they are the ultimate pandemic stay-at-home beneficiaries, especially those known as FANGMAN - an expanded tech group comprising Facebook (O:FB), Apple (O:AAPL), Netflix (O:NFLX), Google (O:GOOGL), Microsoft (O:MSFT), Amazon (O:AMZN) and chipmaker Nvidia (O:NVDA).
Their multiples of 80-100 times forward earnings have led the broader market higher.
Until a few decades ago, bank, oil & gas, and industrial stocks made up a bulk of the S&P 500. These sectors typically trade at lower multiples, given commodity price volatility and high capex needs - a major reason behind this year's underperformance of Britain's FTSE benchmark.
""What's odd about the market debate is that it's set up as follows: look at the S&P 500 and the response is the equity market is expensive. Then you ask people what they like and they favour a lot of the secular-growth, high-multiple stocks,"" said  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) chief cross-asset strategist Andrew Sheets.
A ratio of U.S. stocks on a market weighted basis to an equally weighted index of shares is at its highest levels since the 2008 crisis, indicating the dominance of the handful of large tech stocks in the market. 
For a graphic on Put call ratio: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/yzdvxnbngvx/Put%20call%20ratio.JPG
The valuations make all the more sense because of the lower for longer interest rate environment, said Maximilian Kunkel, CIO of Global Family Offices at UBS.
""As a result we remain constructive on risk assets even after the rally."" 
Many others would seem to agree. On derivative markets, the put-to-call ratio for U.S. stocks, a measure of positioning sentiment, is the lowest since 2010. The ratio is inversely related to equity performance.
Some caution is although warranted, given that asset classes of all stripes have gained. A portfolio with a 25% split in stocks, bonds, cash and gold would have earned a record 18% in the last 90 days, BofA analysts calculate.
But the edifice is vulnerable to a rise in inflation, many argue, with investors' holdings of yield-sensitive investments up $8.1 trillion over 18 months, according to Morgan Stanley.
Though prices have rebounded from deflationary territory fairly quickly, inflation remains far below central bank estimates, indicating equity valuations will remain attractive.
Latest flows data shows investors are switching from cash to equities.
""I would still say investors are underweight equities and that provides a fairly decent backdrop for risk assets to rally,"" said Jason Borbora-Sheen, portfolio manager at Ninety One Asset Management.

1226,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 18, 2020 06:35AM ET</span>","Britain's M&S to cut 7,000 jobs in latest blow to retail sector","By James Davey
LONDON (Reuters) - Marks & Spencer (L:MKS) will cut a further 7,000 jobs, it said on Tuesday, as the COVID-19 crisis deals another blow to Britain's beleaguered retail sector.
""It is clear that there has been a material shift in trade and whilst it is too early to predict with precision where a new post-COVID sales mix will settle, we must act now to reflect this change,"" M&S said.
Clothing and home trading in its stores remained well below last year though online and home delivery were strong, said the retailer, which has a UK workforce of about 78,000.
The 136-year old M&S is seeking to reinvent itself after decades of failed attempts. In May it said the crisis would indelibly change its business and that it would accelerate its turnaround plan.
M&S said the crisis had shown it could work more flexibly and productively with more employees multi-tasking and switching between the food and clothing and home divisions. Its use of technology has also increased.
Last month M&S shed 950 store management jobs. Its latest cuts will impact its headquarters, regional management and UK stores over the next three months.
The cuts add to thousands already announced by other major British retailers, including Boots (O:WBA), John Lewis, Dixons Carphone (L:DC) and WH Smith (L:SMWH). 
M&S expects a significant proportion of its cuts to be through voluntary departures and early retirement. Shopworkers' trade union Usdaw called for urgent talks.
""These proposals are an important step in becoming a leaner, faster business set up to serve changing customer needs,"" CEO Steve Rowe said.
M&S shares were down 2.8% at 0818 GMT, extending 2020 losses to 48%.
The firm said it was retaining a cautious approach to planning for the balance of the year.
Group sales were down 19.2% year on year in the 19 weeks to Aug. 8, which included part of Britain's lockdown period, with clothing and home sales down 49.1% and food sales down 1.1%.
Clothing and home sales were down 29.9% in the eight weeks since stores reopened. Store sales were down 47.9%, while online sales were up 39.2%.
Food stores, which traded throughout the lockdown period, saw sales increase 2.5% in the latest eight weeks.

M&S said it was on track to launch an online food service next month through its partnership with Ocado (L:OCDO).

1227,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 18, 2020 06:20AM ET</span>",Wall Street holds the cards as Main Street chases blank-check deal frenzy,"By Joshua Franklin and Krystal Hu
BOSTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Josh Black was looking for the next lucrative deal after scoring a 500% profit in a few weeks by investing in electric truck maker  Nikola Corp  (O:NKLA) following the announcement of its merger with a blank-check acquisition company.
He then invested $23,000 in  Spartan Energy Acquisition  Corp (N:SPAQ_u) after the special purpose acquisition company (SPAC), backed by buyout firm Apollo Global Management (N:APO), clinched a $2.9 billion deal to merge with electric car maker Fisker.
This time Black wasn't so lucky.
The mechanic from Cherry, Minnesota is down over 10% on his investment after Spartan's stock gave up much of its initial gains following the announcement of the Fisker deal last month.
It's a different story for the big mutual funds, including BlackRock Inc (N:BLK), AllianceBernstein (NYSE:AB) and Federated Hermes (NYSE:FHI) Kaufmann, that were invited to finance the Fisker deal - and buy shares in Spartan before it was announced.
Even after the decline in Spartan's stock, they're still up about 25%.
To be sure, retail investors who buy into SPACs before they clinch deals pay the same price as big Wall Street firms. But they have to do this without knowing what the acquisition target will be, taking a leap of faith on a SPAC's management team.
The biggest SPAC investors are treated differently. 
They are told beforehand what the acquisition target is under confidentiality agreements, in exchange for providing financing for the deal in the form of a private investment in public equity, or PIPE, transaction. 
While preferential treatment of cornerstone investors is allowed under securities regulations, Wall Street's embrace of what used to be a backwater of the stock market underscores how it is now using its heft to tip the scales in its favor.
Federated Hermes portfolio manager Stephen DeNichilo said retail investors buying shares in SPACs ""need to take extra care and do extra due diligence"". 
He said his firm was given advance information on SPAC deals, such as Fisker, because it put in a substantial amount of money as an accredited investor.
""We are taking a greater risk because we are investing earlier on. It takes three months for these transactions to close. A lot can happen in those three months,"" DeNichilo said.
Spartan, Fisker, and AllianceBernstein did not respond to requests for comment. BlackRock declined to comment.
'SMART PEOPLE'
For retail investor Black, though, it was the announcement that well-known Wall Street firms were backing the Fisker deal to the tune of $500 million that embolden him to buy Spartan. 
""Big institutional investors buy huge amounts because they see a good opportunity. They are smart people behind those walls,"" he said.
Black said he was now holding on to the stock, hoping it would go up by the time Spartan completes the merger.
As a record number of companies pursue mergers with SPACs as a way of going public that bypasses the traditional initial public offering (IPO), Wall Street has obliged. 
High-profile financiers such as Bill Ackman and Chamath Palihapitiya have raised billions of dollars for these shell firms through IPOs, with the aim of then combining with real companies in the next couple of years.
Mom-and-pop investors have followed suit, helping fuel a frenzy for SPAC stocks in the wake of their deal announcements. 
While some deals, such as those for Nikola, space tourism company Virgin Galactic Holdings Inc (N:SPCE) and fantasy sports and gambling company DraftKings Inc (O:DKNG), have proved lucrative, others have left retail investors in the red.
The average SPAC underperformed the S&P 500 and Russell 2000 indexes three, six and 12 months after their merger completion, according to  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS) analysts who analyzed 56 SPAC deals since January 2018. 
That's despite the average SPAC outperforming the indexes one month and three months following a deal announcement.
""There is some pump-and-dump trading going on with these SPACs,"" said Rosaria Pellegrino, a bed-and-breakfast owner in Naples, Italy, who is down 30% on her investment in SPACs that did deals with electric truck maker Hyliion and 3D mapping company Velodyne Lidar.
Like Black, she's keeping the stocks for now in the hope of recouping her losses. (Graphic: The SPAC bonanza, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/rlgvdnromvo/eikon.png) 
RECORD SPAC DEALS
As big Wall Street firms pile into SPACs, more and more PIPE deals are being struck with funds providing the bulk of the financing for specific targets. So far this year, PIPE deals with SPACs have totaled $3.1 billion, already more than for the whole of 2019, according to SPAC Research.
""The fact that investors in size are willing to commit to the transaction and forward underwrite market risk for months serves as a guidepost to the rest of the market and usually results in positive price momentum once the transaction is announced,"" said Niron Stabinsky, who heads  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Group's SPAC practice.
PIPE deals have helped push SPAC acquisitions in 2020 to a record $27.4 billion, including debt, with a further $35.2 billion worth of deals announced and pending completion. SPAC deals last year came to $24.8 billion.
""The greater availability of institutional PIPE capital often enables these deals to get done,"" said Joel Rubinstein, a partner at law firm White & Case LLP who leads the firm's SPAC practice.
The pipeline looks even stronger.
SPACs have raised $22.5 billion this year to spend on deals, exceeding the record $13.6 billion raised in 2019. There are 104 SPACs, which have raised together $32.4 billion, currently chasing deals, according to SPAC Research.
""Since COVID-19 came into the U.S. and impacted the economy, merging with a SPAC allows a company to explain their story a little bit differently to the traditional IPO process,"" said Douglas Adams, global co-head of equity capital markets at  Citigroup  Inc (N:C). 
In many cases, there are no restrictions placed on Wall Street firms on when they can cash out after a PIPE deal with a SPAC. Armed with knowledge of what a SPAC's acquisition target will be, the big institutional investors also get a chance to grab a big slice of these deals for themselves.

""On a hot IPO, an institutional investor may only get a 2%-4% allocation of a deal. But in a SPAC deal they get potentially 10%-20% of the PIPE,"" said Jeff Mortara, head of U.S. equity capital markets origination at UBS Group (S:UBSG).

1228,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 18, 2020 06:10AM ET</span>","India urges auto companies to cut royalties to foreign parents, say sources","By Aditi Shah
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's commerce minister has asked automakers to find ways to reduce royalty payments to foreign parent companies for use of technology or brand names, two sources told Reuters, in an effort to boost local investment and reduce outflows.
In India's competitive auto market, top-selling carmakers Maruti Suzuki (NS:MRTI) and  Hyundai Motor 's (KS:005380) local unit pay millions of dollars in royalties to parent companies in Japan and South Korean for using their technology and brand to build and sell cars.
The minister, Piyush Goyal, in a meeting last week asked officials from groups representing carmakers and auto parts manufacturers to review such payments with a view to reducing them, said people with direct knowledge of the discussions.
""The concern raised during the meeting was that the outflow is high, even for old technologies, and something should be done about it,"" said one of the sources. 
The sources declined to be named as the talks are private.
The ministry did not respond to a request for comment.
India, for years, has debated imposing stricter caps on royalty payments which spiked after 2009 when foreign investment rules were eased and restrictions on such payments were removed.
The country's markets regulator last year suggested imposing curbs on payments exceeding 2% of revenue. The limit was finally set at 5% after complaints from some sectors and fears it may dissuade foreign firms from investing or sharing technology.
Recently however, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government has made a renewed push to make the country a major manufacturing hub by encouraging domestic production and curbing imports. It also wants to increase local investment and reduce foreign outflows.
While India does not restrict the amount that can be paid as royalty, any payment by a locally listed company exceeding 5% of revenues needs shareholder approval.
Listed companies such as Maruti Suzuki (NS:MRTI) and parts makers including  Bosch  (NS:BOSH), Schaeffler India (NS:SCHE) and Wabco India (NS:WABC) typically pay royalties of between 1%-5% to their foreign owners.
Maruti Suzuki paid 38.2 billion rupees ($510 million) as royalty to its Japanese parent Suzuki Motor (T:7269) in the fiscal year ending March 31, 2020, amounting to 5% of its revenue, according to its annual report. 
Privately-owned companies such as Hyundai's local unit paid $150 million or 2.6% of revenue as royalties to its South Korean parent in fiscal 2019 and Toyota Motor's (T:7203) India arm paid $88 million or 3.4% of revenue to its Japanese parent, government data shows.
Royalty provision has been important in attracting foreign investments into various sectors in India, especially autos, said Vaibhav Gupta, partner at tax firm, Dhruva Advisors.
""Depending on the form in which the government brings back such caps ... it may impact the ability of auto companies to benefit from the use of foreign brands and technical know-how,"" said Gupta. 
He said for many foreign companies royalties are a profit repatriation strategy and changes to these could impact operating and supply chain structures from a fiscal perspective.
Maruti, Toyota and Bosch declined to comment. Hyundai, Schaeffler and Wabco did not respond to emails seeking comment.
Such payments have also been a long-standing issue with minority shareholders.

A February report by proxy firm Institutional Investor Advisory Services showed royalty paid by 31 leading Indian companies with foreign parents, including Maruti and Bosch, grew 9% in fiscal year 2019 to total $1.11 billion.

1230,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 18, 2020 05:40AM ET</span>",StockBeat: M&S's Time Is Running Out,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- Marks & Spencer (LON:MKS) just can’t win.
The embattled U.K. department store’s stock fell over 3% by mid-morning in London after doing what every analyst and investor hoped it would do by announcing it will cut 7,000 jobs to stem losses. It's now down 49% for the year.
While it’s some time since what went for M&S went for the whole of U.K. retail, the announcement nonetheless has implications beyond the company’s share price. It comes within days of the government announcing that it will wind down its wage-support scheme for struggling businesses in October, a decision that surely removed any lingering doubts M&S management may have had about how fast and how deep to cut. Similar announcements from other companies will surely increase in frequency.
The shares, which have been a prime example of the trends hurting traditional retailers even before the pandemic had actually been indicated higher in premarket after an early-morning release to the stock exchange. But they reversed almost immediately as attention switched to the uncomfortable fact that the statement still had no signs of a long-term turnaround for the business.
The cuts are equivalent to just under 10% of M&S’s workforce, and will mainly hit its high street stores and regional management. The number will be partly offset – to an unspecified degree – by hiring in online fulfilment and the company’s so-called ‘ambient food warehouse’.
“These proposals are an important step in becoming a leaner, faster business set up to serve changing customer needs,” chief executive Steve Rowe said in the statement.
As always, the problems lie in the company’s fast-withering home and clothing business, once the strongest name in U.K. retail.
Total revenue at that division was down 39% in the 13 weeks through August 8th, a figure that includes five weeks in which stores were shut by U.K. lockdown measures. In the eight weeks since they were lifted, sales at the division were still down nearly 30%. The best that M&S could say was that the trend was “steadily improving.”
It is, of course, a different story with the group’s food operations, which have been carved out into a joint venture with logistics specialist Ocado  (LON:OCDO). Food sales were up 2.5%, despite the closure of many outlets embedded in Covid-affected travel hubs. Excluding those, sales were up 10.6%.
M&S said some of its newer out-of-town stores are now performing at close to last year’s levels. Online sales for the home and clothing lines have also done well, rising 46%. The problem, predictably, is with its big flagship stores in major cities, which continue to languish. The statement gave no indication of when a turnaround there could be expected.
The day when M&S spins off the food business into a separate listing to salvage some value for shareholders is surely approaching. For the rest, it seems just a question of time, and it is the coronavirus that will decide how much."
1231,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 18, 2020 05:18AM ET</span>",Ex-Wirecard CEO Met Senior Bundesbank Official in 2019,"(Bloomberg) --
Former Wirecard AG (OTC:WCAGY) Chief Executive Officer Markus Braun met with a senior Bundesbank official last year in the midst of allegations of accounting irregularities at the German payments company.
The Sept. 4 meeting between Braun and Burkhard Balz, a Bundesbank executive board member, was intended as a chance to “get to know each other and exchange views on digital developments in payment transactions,” Germany’s Finance Ministry said in a response to questions from a Green party lawmaker. The meeting was part of a growing effort by Braun to intensify contacts with German authorities.
The ministry’s response, which is based on information provided by the Bundesbank, doesn’t state whether the allegations of wrongdoing were discussed during the encounter at the central bank’s offices in Frankfurt. Still, the meeting draws the institution further into the fallout from Wirecard’s spectacular collapse in June, when it said that funds amounting to a quarter of its balance sheet probably don’t exist.
A Bundesbank spokesman declined to comment.
The ministry’s response does show that the Bundesbank was kept abreast of several developments regarding Wirecard at Germany’s top financial watchdog, BaFin. It also provides details on another key question: why German authorities didn’t classify Wirecard as a financial firm, which would subject it to closer scrutiny.
That’s likely to be in focus when the finance committee of Germany’s parliament grills officials including Bundesbank representatives at a special meeting on Sept. 1 in Berlin.
The Bundesbank and BaFin deemed in 2017 that not enough of Wirecard’s business was sufficiently financial in nature to merit a classification as a financial company, according to the document.
However, a division within Wirecard that housed its bank and certain other operations was deemed to be a financial holding company. Wirecard then explored an overhaul that would allow the intermediate holding company to shed that label, although Wirecard as a whole still wouldn’t have come under direct scrutiny, according to the ministry’s response.
Balz is responsible for payments, while banking supervision is the remit of a different board member at the Bundesbank.

1232,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 18, 2020 05:15AM ET</span>",Europe cuts losses as travel shares rebound,"By Sruthi Shankar
(Reuters) - European shares pared early losses on Tuesday as travel stocks rebounded, but rising U.S.-China tensions and underwhelming earnings report from mining group BHP weighed on sentiment.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index (STOXX) edged up 0.1%, with travel and leisure stocks (SXTP) gaining 0.9% after suffering sharp losses earlier this week as many European countries imposed curbs amid a pick-up in coronavirus cases.
Other defensive sectors that are considered more stable in times of economic uncertainty such as real estate (SX86P), telecoms (SXkP) and utilities (SXKP) rose more than 0.4%.
The global mood remained cautious after the Trump administration's plan to tighten curbs on China's Huawei Technologies Co [HWT.UL] ratcheted up tensions with Beijing. That followed record gains for Wall Street's technology stocks overnight as investors bought into a stellar run this year that has taken the S&P 500 (SPX) near all-time highs.
""What we're seeing is some consolidation in European markets given that in the past two months, we're more or less trading sideways as opposed to the U.S. where growth stocks have been lifting the overall market,"" said Matthias Bausch, senior cross asset strategist at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG).
""Liquidity is more important than earnings growth at the moment, and we have record high money supply growth in the U.S. and Europe.""
However, UK-listed miner BHP Group (AX:BHP), (L:BHPB) fell 1.5% as its annual profit fell 4%, missing analysts' estimate, while also warning that most major economies except China will have to bear the brunt of a coronavirus-led downturn this year.
Danish Jewellery maker  Pandora  (CO:PNDORA) tumbled 7.7% as it said the number of closed shops increased slightly in August, and the current level of store traffic is ""well below"" that was seen before the lockdowns.
Britain's Marks & Spencer (L:MKS) reversed early gains to trade 3.7% after it revealed plans to cut a further 7,000 jobs, dealing the latest blow to the beleaguered retail sector from the COVID-19 crisis.

Swiss plumbing materials company  Geberit  (S:GEBN) gained 2.0% as it expects the construction sector to return to normal in the second half of the year, provided there is not another wave of COVID-19-related lockdowns.

World stocks have bounced back by a whopping 51%, adding $24 trillion in value, in five months as investors bet that economic activity would rebound rapidly after record plunges.
Of the 181 survey participants, who manage half-a-trillion dollars in assets, a net 79% expect a stronger economy, the strongest reading since December 2009.
But evidence of a new wave coronavirus infections in some countries has led to some caution and the survey showed that a pandemic ""second wave"" was still seen as the biggest risk to markets for the fifth straight month.
Other findings from the survey included that long U.S. tech and growth stocks were the ""most crowded"" trade for the fourth month running as the pandemic transformed the way people work, study and shop, making tech stocks the ultimate beneficiaries.

As global equities near record highs, strategists told Reuters that the quickfire bear-to-bull switch was not only justified but deserves to go further.

The move represents MSCI's efforts to promote environmental, social and governance (ESG) standards in China, where the government seeks a difficult balance between reducing pollution and sustaining growth in a coronavirus-hit economy.
The newly created climate change indexes were based on the MSCI China Index and the MSCI China A Index. Compared with their parent indexes, the new indexes allocate more weighting to less polluting companies.
For example, internet giant Tencent enjoys an additional weight of 1.61% in the MSCI China Climate Change Index, while LONGi Green Energy Technology is awarded an extra weight of 1.4% in the China A Climate Change Index.
Jack Lin, head of APAC client coverage at MSCI, expects investors to increasingly focus on the climate change indexes. 
""It's not about the world outlook. It's about economic efficiency. It's about higher returns and lower risks,"" Lin said. ""The market will discount share prices of companies with poor ESG compliance.""
MSCI China Climate Change Index outperformed its parent gauge by an annualized 0.4% in the past 6.5 years, MSCI said.
Shuo Xu, Vice President MSCI Research, said the index publisher is already in talks with quite a few institutions about creating investment products based on the new indexes.

The index launch comes amid China's push to open up its capital markets. The participation of ESG-conscious foreign investors is putting pressure on listed companies in China, where ESG disclosure is often seen as sporadic, non-standard, and inconsistent.

Investing.com - European stock markets weakened Tuesday amid heightened tensions between the U.S. and China, and as virus cases increase across the continent.
At 4:05 AM ET (0805 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.1% lower, the CAC 40 in France fell 0.1% and the U.K.'s FTSE index was down 0.2%.
Sino-U.S. tensions have weighed on market confidence of late, and the Trump administration stated Monday that it would further tighten restrictions on China's Huawei Technologies, cracking down on its access to commercially available chips. 
The curbs follow U.S. President Donald Trump’s ban on the TikTok and WeChat apps in the U.S. and the introduction of a new security law in Hong Kong. The two sides also postponed a planned six-month review of their phase-one trade agreement at the weekend.
Turning back to Europe, Germany recorded the highest number of new coronavirus cases in nearly four months, adding to the new outbreaks in many European countries prompting the tightening of restrictions on public life again.
In corporate news, U.K.-listed miner BHP Group’s stock slipped 2.3% as it reported a 4% drop in annual profit, hit by $1.1 billion in one-off charges, and a cut in its dividend.
Danish jewellery maker Pandora fell 7.7% as it said the number of closed shops increased slightly in August, seeing 2020 sales falling by as much as 20% due to the pandemic.
On the flip side, Marks and Spencer (LON:MKS) rose 1.8% after it revealed plans to cut a further 7,000 jobs, cutting costs severely to cope with the reduction in revenue in the wake of the Covid-19 crisis.
Still, stock market moves are likely to be small ahead of Wednesday's release of the Federal Reserve minutes. Additionally, markets will be keeping an eye on flash PMI surveys on manufacturing and service sector activity, due Friday, which should show whether the European recovery is still on track.
Oil prices remained in a tight range Tuesday as the market awaited the American Petroleum Institute’s crude oil stocks update, due later in the day, and then Wednesday’s OPEC+ joint ministerial monitoring committee meeting for further production clues. 
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies, a grouping known as OPEC+, reduced their agreed cuts to 7.7 million barrels per day in August from 9.7 million barrels per day previously as prices started picking up.
Compliance with these output cuts was seen at around 97% in July, two OPEC+ sources told Reuters late Monday.
U.S. crude futures traded flat at $42.89 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract rose 0.2% to $45.47.

HONG KONG/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Baring Private Equity Asia and CITIC Capital have sold the China business of Wall Street English (WSE) at a deep discount in just over two years since acquiring it as the COVID-19 pandemic crippled the global language tutoring group, sources told Reuters.
Baring confirmed the sale of WSE China, which at the time of the purchase showcased strong sales and operating profit growth in the world's second-largest economy, to its original founder but gave no details.
Separately, U.S. buyout firm Bain Capital-owned Trans Maldivian Airways is struggling to repay a $305-million acquisition loan, as the virus outbreak halts tourism, other sources said.
Bain bought the world's largest sea plane operator, currently grappling with grounded planes and almost zero revenue, for over $500 million in 2017, with two partners. Bain has been given an August-end deadline by lenders to settle the loan, they said.
Bain declined to comment. CITIC Capital referred the query to Baring. WSE and TMA did not immediately respond to a query for comment.
The sources declined to be named as they were not authorised to speak to the media. 
Buyout firms across Asia are scrambling to pare their exposure to COVID-hit companies, putting the brakes on new fundraising which dropped to an eight-year low in the first half.
The pandemic poses the most severe challenges faced by PE firms in the region since the global financial crisis as company valuations take a beating. This has impeded their exit prospects while pushing up capital costs, potentially spelling weaker returns if not outright losses.
Luke Pais, head of ASEAN private equity at EY, said PE firms were very much focused on portfolio liquidity – 'the burning' problem in the initial months of the pandemic.
""The approach has been to try and take out unnecessary costs as much as possible, draw down all credit lines and optimise cash conservation until things pick up,"" he said, pointing to PE exits likely to be pushed back by 12-18 months or longer.
Asia-focussed PE fundraising slumped 44% year-on-year to $13 billion in the first quarter of 2020 to the lowest since the third quarter of 2013. Funding rose to $18 billion in the second quarter but was down 40% from a year earlier, Preqin data shows.
SOME OPTIMISTIC SIGNS
In order to avoid selling assets during a coronavirus-induced economic downturn, PE firms in the U.S. have also sought to recapitalize their portfolio companies mostly by drawing down bank revolving credit facilities and cutting costs. 
The education, travel and retail sectors are among the worst hit but investment in others in Asia is picking up.
In retail, Chinese buyout firm Hony Capital has decided to cease control of UK's PizzaExpress, which it bought for 900 million pounds ($1.2 billion) in 2014, to creditors in a debt-for-equity swap, sources said.
Hony, which may keep the Chinese business of Pizza Express, declined comment. PizzaExpress also declined to comment.
With a record $388 billion war chest, some PE firms are, however, seeking investments in the technology, internet and healthcare sectors, as demand for those services grows.
""That's the whole thesis of what could be benefiting or what could be actually coming out of this in a positive trend,"" said Kiki Yang, co-head of Asia Pacific PE practice at consulting firm Bain & Co.

STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Norwegian Air (OL:NORR) has been rejected for a state credit guarantee under a Swedish government support programme for airlines, the country's debt office said on Tuesday.
While there is no immediate impact on the airline, it has previously indicated that more cash will be required to rebuild after the coronavirus crisis took a heavy toll of its operations. 
The group received emergency financial guarantees from the Norwegian government in May, but only after raising cash from owners and forcing creditors to convert part of the debt to equity.
The Swedish government has stipulated that its credit guarantees may only be granted to airlines assessed to have been financially viable on the last day of 2019. 
""The Debt Office’s assessment in regard to Norwegian is that as of 31 December 2019 there was a very high risk that Norwegian would not be able to fulfil its financial commitments and that the company was not deemed capable then of managing further indebtedness,"" it said in a statement. 
""Therefore, the company has not been considered financially viable as of 31 December 2019. Accordingly, Norwegian’s application has been denied.""
A Norwegian Air spokesman was not immediately available for comment.
The Swedish debt office's decision cannot be appealed.
Rapid growth had made Norwegian Air Europe's third-largest budget airline and the biggest non-U.S. carrier serving New York and other major U.S. cities, but with that expansion came debts and liabilities totalling about $8 billion by the end of 2019.

Norwegian was forced to close down most of its routes in March as the coronavirus outbreak spread, including its transatlantic network. At one point, it operated only domestic flights in Norway, using eight aircaft and mothballing a fleet of about 150 planes.

LONDON (Reuters) - Grocery sales in Britain rose 7% year-on-year in the four weeks to Aug. 8, slowing from previous weeks as shoppers began to settle into new post-COVID 19 lockdown routines, industry data showed on Tuesday. 
Market researcher Nielsen said the growth, though down from 10% in last month's report, was driven by warm weather and Britons continuing to work from home, spending less on eating out, and taking ""staycation"" holidays.
It said that over the four week period, in-store sales growth was just 0.3%, but online grocery growth continued to accelerate, up 117%, maintaining its 14% share of all grocery sales.
Consumers were still shopping less often than they did prior to the pandemic, Nielsen said, noting visits to stores were down 15% on the same period last year, but this was up from the 22% drop registered in May.
Over the 12 week period to Aug. 8, Morrisons (L:MRW), Britain's No. 4 supermarket group, was the top performer of the country's big four grocers with a 13.6% rise in sales.

Still, stock market moves are likely to be small ahead of Wednesday's release of the Federal Reserve minutes, with speculation that the Fed will adopt an average inflation target. Given inflation has been below target for some time, an average inflation target would imply the central bank is happy to have a loose monetary policy for a longer period than might ordinarily have been expected.

It also declared a final dividend of 55 cents per share, down from 78 cents a year earlier.

Compliance with these output cuts was seen at around 97% in July, two OPEC+ sources told Reuters late Monday.
U.S. crude futures traded 0.3% lower at $42.77 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract fell 0.2% to $45.28. 
Elsewhere, gold futures rose 0.3% to $2.005.20/oz, helped by a weaker dollar, with EUR/USD traded 0.2% higher at 1.1893."

Investing.com – JD (NASDAQ:JD).com Inc (HK:9618) saw better-than-expected revenue in the second quarter on the back of increased sales across its online malls, as well as securing an investment from global private equity firm Hillhouse Capital Group.
JD.com’s Hong Kong shares jumped 7.75% to HK$261.40 ($X) by 1: 42AM ET (6: 42AM GMT).
The e-commerce giant saw its fastest rate of revenue growth in three years during the quarter, with sale sales recording a 34% jump to CNY201.05 billion ($28.9733 billion).
The jump was attributed to the release of locked-up consumer demand after the lifting of COVID-19 lockdown measures throughout the country in April, as well as a successful “6.18” anniversary promotion event.
Increased usage in lower-tier cities and the wider use of online shopping in general due to COVID-19 is forecasted to drive long-term demand, and make up for the success of the “6.18” event being non-replicable in the third quarter.
Meanwhile, Hillhouse will invest more than $850 million into JD.com subsidiary JD Health via the purchase of Series B preference shares. The funds will also be invested into JD Health’s pharmacy supply chain, and JD.com will remain JD Health’s majority shareholder after the transaction closes in the third quarter of 2020."

Starbucks' Korean unit was a bright spot for the U.S. coffee chain, with the joint venture posting a profit surge in the April-June quarter as the country quickly brought the COVID-19 outbreak under control. Globally, Starbucks swung to a loss globally for the period. 
But South Korea is battling a resurgence in virus cases in Seoul and surrounding areas, with the largest outbreak connected with a church and smaller outbreaks happening in cafes, restaurants and other places. 
South Korean health authorities are investigating how the virus spread at the Starbucks outlet in border city of Paju, saying infected people were not wearing masks and fresh air may not have been properly circulated.
Starbucks Korea, a joint venture between Starbucks and the country's retail giant  E-Mart  Inc (KS:139480), has reduced seating capacity by more than 30% in all its stores in Seoul city, Gyeonggi province and Busan city after authorities on Sunday reimposed tighter social distancing curbs in the Seoul metropolitan area.
The coffee chain said it would also enhance hygiene rules across all stores, recommend customers wear face masks and delayed a promotional event that offered Playmobil figures.
South Korea on Tuesday reported 246 new cases of the novel coronavirus, bringing the country's tally to 15,761 infections with 306 deaths.
Starbucks has more than 1,400 stores in South Korea, almost as many stores as it has in Japan, which has more than twice the population, according to its website. 

Starbucks Korea last week reported an operating profit of 617 million won ($521,000) in the April-June period, up more than 54% from the same period a year earlier.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Ant Group,  Alibaba 's (N:BABA) fintech arm and China's dominant mobile payments company, plans to set up a consumer finance firm in the southwestern city of Chongqing, expanding its presence in the fast-growing domestic business, two sources told Reuters.
The move underlines a broader push by Ant and other Chinese tech majors, including Tencent (HK:0700) and Bytedance, to bulk up in financial services closer to home as they battle mounting scrutiny for their technology business overseas and a worsening Sino-U.S. standoff.
Ant, 33% owned by e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding, has already amassed a range of financial licenses https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-ant-financial-insurance/chinas-ant-financial-amasses-50-million-users-mostly-low-income-in-new-health-plan-idUSKCN1RO0H5 including payments, online banking, insurance and micro lending to operate in China's vast financial market valued at trillions of dollars. 
Ant plans to team up with Nanyang Commercial Bank and Alibaba-backed intelligent transport services firm China TransInfo Technology (SZ:002373) for the consumer finance business, said the sources, who have direct knowledge of the matter but declined to be named as the information was private. 
Ant will hold about a 50% stake, while Nanyang Commercial and TransInfo will own 15% and 10%, respectively, of the new firm. Other co-founders include battery maker Contemporary Amperex Technology Co Ltd (CATL) (SZ:300750), they added.
The founders plan to invest a total of about 8 billion yuan($1.2 billion) in the firm as the registered capital and look to sign the agreement as early as on Friday, the sources added.
Ant and CATL declined to comment. 
Nanyang Commercial Bank and TransInfo did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 
Ant said last month it had started the process for a dual listing in Hong Kong and Shanghai. The group plans to raise over $20 billion in total from the dual-listing, separate sources have told Reuters.
BOOMING DEMAND 
The consumer finance firm, which could start operating in the fourth quarter of the year, aims to grow into one of China's biggest consumer lending players, one of the sources said. 
While Ant already runs two micro-loan firms in Chongqing, the new company would be a big boost as the lending scale of a consumer finance firm can reach 10 times its registered capital. The leverage ratio of an online micro-loan firm is only two to three times that amount. 
Internet-based consumer financing in China, a lightly regulated sector, surged 400 times to nearly 8 trillion yuan in four years to 2018, according to the Guanghua School of Management.

A pandemic-hit economy has dampened demand for consumer credit, but officials have pinpointed consumer lenders as a key lever in rebooting consumption.

Investing.com – Asian stocks were mixed on Tuesday morning, with simmering U.S.-China tensions over the U.S.’ new restrictions on Huawei Technologies putting a damper on the U.S. markets’ tech-driven rally during the previous session.
The Commerce Department said on Monday that Huawei’s access to commercially available chips would be further restricted, with 38 Huawei affiliates in 21 countries added to an economic blacklist. The latest restrictions are in addition to those announced by the U.S. in May and will further limit the adoption of Huawei’s 5G technology. Huawei is heavily reliant on the chips for its 5G base stations and smartphones, with its current stockpile of some self-designed chips estimated to run out by nearly 2021.
The curbs are the latest cause of tension between the two countries, with U.S. President Donald Trump’s ban of the Tiktok and WeChat apps in the U.S., Hong Kong’s national security laws and Taiwan among the other causes.
Both Huawei and China have yet to respond to the move. But China’s Shanghai Composite was little changed, inching up 0.05% by 11:15 PM ET (4:15 AM GMT), while the Shenzhen Component edged lower to 0.15%.
The People's Bank of China is also set to release its loan prime rate on Thursday.
Meanwhile, investors are also looking to see whether the U.S. Congress will reach a consensus on the latest stimulus package. Both the Senate and the House of Representatives wrapped their sessions up during the previous week without reaching an agreement on the package, with the House not due to resume its session until September 14.
“A lot of investment professionals as well as retail investors are on the sidelines partially because they are waiting for this second stimulus package,” Erin Gibbs, president and chief investment officer at Gibbs Wealth Management, told Bloomberg.
“It’s not a full-on risk on environment just yet,” she added.
The U.S. Federal Reserve is also scheduled to release its minutes on Wednesday, which are widely expected to show the adoption of an average inflation target and likely to push inflation above 2% for some time.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index edged up 0.17%.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 fell 0.50% and South Korea’s KOSPI was down 0.38% after returning from a holiday.
Down Under, the ASX 200 rose 0.55%. Victoria state reported the lowest daily rise in new COVID-19 cases in a month on Tuesday, raising cautious hopes of an ease in the country’s second wave of infections."

(Reuters) - Epic Games said on Monday it was seeking to block Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s removal of ""Fortnite"" from its app store and has asked a judge to prevent any retaliatory action against its other games in the store.
In its filing, Epic Chief Executive Timothy Sweeney said ""Fortnite"" had 350 million registered users as of June 2020, but that Apple's move will stop them from getting the updates needed to play the game's most popular mode - a ""Battle Royale"" match of up 100 players where the last survivor wins.
""Apple's actions will 'break' Fortnite for millions of existing players,"" Sweeney wrote, saying Epic updates the game every few weeks. ""Because iOS users can no longer update the game, they will be unable to play Fortnite with most other players, who will have the then-current version available on other platforms"" such as PCs. 
The videogame maker also said Apple will terminate all of Epic Games' developer accounts and cut it off from its development tools starting Aug. 28.
In addition to making its own titles, Epic also makes tools for other game developers such as the Unreal Engine, which helps game developers create three-dimensional graphics. The tool is also used by medical imaging companies and car designers and is used by millions of developers, Epic said.
In its filing, Epic alleged that if Apple cuts off its access to Apple's developers, it will be unable to keep offering the Unreal Engine for Mac and iPhone operating systems, which would in turn affect hundreds of game titles. Some of the games, such as PUBG, have hundreds of millions of players, Epic wrote in its filing.
""The effects will reverberate well beyond video games; it will affect developers who use the Unreal Engine on Apple products in many fields,"" Epic said in its filing asking the court to issue an order blocking Apple's move. ""The ensuing impact on the Unreal Engine’s viability, and the trust and confidence developers have in that engine, cannot be repaired with a monetary award.""
Apple has in the past worked closely with Epic to make Unreal Engine work better on its devices. In 2018, for example, Apple demonstrated how Unreal Engine worked with its latest augmented reality tools at its annual developer conference. After Epic's move to offer direct payments, Apple threatened to end that collaboration, according to documents filed by Epic in the lawsuit.
""The problem Epic has created for itself is one that can easily be remedied if they submit an update of their app that reverts it to comply with the guidelines they agreed to and which apply to all developers,"" Apple said in a statement late on Tuesday.
""We won't make an exception for Epic because we don't think it's right to put their business interests ahead of the guidelines that protect our customers,"" the company added.
Apple earlier removed ""Fortnite"" from its app store for violating in-app payment guidelines prompting Epic to file federal lawsuits challenging the rule. 

Epic rolled out a social media campaign with the hashtag #FreeFortnite, urging players to seek refunds from Apple if they lose access to the game, and creating a parody of Apple's famous ""1984"" television ad.

The commission, in a letter dated Aug. 11, notified Meng's attorney that the agency had received anonymous complaints, which it said was based on a news article. It attached a Financial Times article regarding Meng's investments and his disclosure of them and said it would investigate all allegations. 
The commission, however, added that it had not made any determination about Meng's culpability.
Meng resigned from his position at California Public Employees' Retirement System (CalPERS) earlier this month, saying he needed to focus on his health and family. 
Last week, California State Controller Betty Yee had called for the board of CalPERS to launch an inquiry into the abrupt exit of its chief investment officer.
Meng has twice worked for CalPERS, the first time starting in 2008 and the second time beginning in January 2019 when he became CIO, according to the fund's website.
In between the CalPERS stints, he worked for three years as deputy CIO with China's State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE), which oversees China's U.S. Treasury security holdings.
Meng's resignation came amid pressure from the Trump administration to curb investments in China.
CalPERS and Meng's lawyer did not immediately respond to request for comment while the Fair Political Practices Commission said it did not comment on complaints or open investigations.

The Wall Street Journal reported news of the investigation earlier on Monday.

(Reuters) -  Boeing Co  (N:BA) said on Monday it would offer employees a voluntary layoff package with pay and benefits for the second time this year, as the planemaker battles a coronavirus-induced slowdown in global air travel.
It will be offered to employees in the commercial airplanes and services businesses as well as corporate functions, Chief Executive Officer Dave Calhoun wrote in a note to employees, a copy of which was seen by Reuters.
""Unfortunately, layoffs are a hard but necessary step to align to our new reality, preserve liquidity and position ourselves for the eventual return to growth,"" Calhoun said in the note.
""We anticipate seeing a significantly smaller marketplace over the next three years."" 
The health crisis, which has hammered planemakers, airlines and suppliers, has added to the woes of Boeing that has been grappling with a production freeze and year-long grounding of the 737 MAX following two fatal crashes.
The company doesn't have a set target at this time and was encouraging all eligible employees interested in the voluntary layoff package to apply, Boeing said in a statement.
The move to extend the overall workforce reductions beyond the initial 10% target is in response to employee feedback, Calhoun said.
The planemaker had said in April it would cut its 160,000-person workforce by about 10%, many of which was to be completed by the end of this year at its commercial aircraft division.

More details will be made available to the employees beginning Aug. 24, according to the CEO's note.

JD (NASDAQ:JD).com Inc. unveiled better-than-expected revenue and a major investment from Hillhouse Capital, after China’s second-biggest e-commerce firm rode a bounce-back in spending across its online malls.
Shares in JD rose 7.9% in New York after it reported a 34% jump in sales to 201.05 billion yuan ($29 billion) in the June quarter, its fastest pace of revenue growth since 2017. The company also disclosed its JD Health division would get more than $830 million from Hillhouse -- the investment firm founded by Zhang Lei with money from Yale University -- through the purchase of Series B preference shares. The funds will also be used to strengthen its pharmacy supply chain.
The company’s out-performance provides more evidence that China’s economy is among the world’s fastest to recover from the pandemic, aided by strict virus control measures and a rebound in industry output and consumer sentiment. Both JD and larger rival  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd. racked up record sales during the annual “6.18” shopping extravaganza this year, as heavy discounting drew shoppers who had delayed purchases during the worst of Covid-19. Annual active customers grew 30% to 417 million, the quickest rate of expansion in more than two years.
The continued shift toward e-commerce has benefited JD, which is expanding into smaller towns and tapping on strategies like live-streaming to reach new customers and fend off growing competition from the likes of ByteDance Ltd.’s Douyin.
”Our supermarket category, including FMCG and fresh produce, became the single largest product category as revenue in the first half of 2020, surpassing mobile phone, home appliance, home computers,” Chief Financial Officer Sandy Ran Xu told analysts on a post-earnings call.

Operations in 2Q benefited from pent-up consumer demand due to China’s 1Q lockdown, and strong sales at the company’s “6.18” anniversary promotion, which won’t recur in 3Q. However, the rapid gain of users from lower-tier cities could drive a sustained increase in long-term demand in categories such as consumer goods, fresh produce, household and health-care products.

Hillhouse had backed JD before its IPO. The transaction will close in the current quarter, and the retailer will remain the majority shareholder of JD Health, according to the statement.
JD completed a second listing in Hong Kong in June, raising $3.9 billion to build its logistics and delivery network. That self-operated web of warehouses, personnel and transport links proved instrumental in controlling shipping during the worst of the pandemic, when nationwide lockdowns snarled supply lines. The shares jumped as much as 8.6% in Hong Kong on Tuesday.
Chinese retail suffered a record collapse in the first three months of 2020 but has since bounced back, though concerns remain about the strength and sustainability of domestic consumption.
“While the YoY growth rate for electronic and home appliance products is expected to normalize in 3Q20, we expect the momentum for general merchandise to persist, as the demand for consumer goods remained strong in July even without promotion,” Bocom International analysts led by Brandy Sun wrote.

The producer aims to sell, or spinoff, its 80% share in the BHP Mitsui Coal joint venture, which owns two coking coal operations in Australia, along with exiting thermal coal mines and some oil and gas operations, the company said Tuesday when reporting annual profits held steady at $9.1 billion, boosted by higher iron ore prices.
Henry, installed as chief executive officer in January, is focusing BHP on supplying higher-quality iron ore and coking coal to capture China’s shift to prioritize premium raw materials for its steel sector. At the same time, he’s laying the ground for a longer-term transition to favor growth in copper and nickel to meet expected rising demand from renewable energy and the electrification of transport.
“The world is rapidly changing with decarbonization of energy sources, population growth and the drive for higher living standards in the developing world,” the company said. “It will require us to continue to be active portfolio managers.”
BHP has been considering plans to offload its Australian thermal coal mine and one-third stake in the Cerrejon operation in Colombia for more than a year and has rejected some early offers, people familiar with the matter said last month. A process to exit those mines, and the coking coal venture with Mitsui & Co., will now advance options for trade sales, or a demerger into a separate listed entity.

The company confirmed it will also plan to sell its 50% stake in the Bass Strait oil and gas joint venture with  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM). in southeastern Australia. Exxon said in September it also plans to exit. “We will seek to divest oil and gas assets that are mature or which are likely to realize greater value under different ownership,” Henry said.
A decision on adding potash production through the initial development of the Jansen project in Canada has been delayed until mid-2021, BHP said. The project, which may cost as much as $5.7 billion, could benefit from improving supply and demand dynamics from the late 2020s or early 2030s, the company said.
To support plans to reshape BHP’s portfolio, Henry promoted Johan van Jaarsveld as Chief Development Officer. In other appointments, Laura Tyler was moved into a new role as Chief Technical Officer and Ragnar Udd will become President, Minerals Americas.

While miners have seen green shoots emerge from an economic pickup in the world's top metals user, as well as a boost in infrastructure spending, the risk of new virus outbreaks around the world threatens to undermine growth, BHP said.
The warning came as BHP reported underlying profit attributable from continuing operations for the year ended June 30 fell to $9.06 billion - below estimates of $9.42 billion, according to Refinitiv IBES data.
""With the exception of China, the world's major economies will contract during the 2020 calendar year as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic,"" Chief Executive Officer Mike Henry said in a statement.
Henry added that the potential for fresh waves of coronavirus infections in key markets was weighing on the demand outlook for 2021 at the world's largest listed miner.
""Not too many surprises in there,"" said portfolio manager Andy Forster of Argo Investments in Sydney. ""Maybe a touch under expected, and the dividend a bit below.""
Shares fell by as much as 1.3% before rebounding to be down 0.9% at A$39.48, compared with a 0.7% rise in the broader index
The profit miss was in contrast to rival Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO), which last month rode its iron ore-rich portfolio to beat profit estimates and touted ""a very steep V-shaped"" recovery in China.
It declared a final dividend of 55 cents per share, down from 78 cents a year earlier, but still in line with its payout ratio.
BHP also said it was reshaping its portfolio for a decarbonising world, by seeking to divest its thermal coal operations.
It will look at options including a demerger or sale of the thermal coal assets, which include 80% of the BHP Mitsui Coal joint venture, the New South Wales Energy Coal operations and one-third of the Cerrejón mine in Colombia.

It also said it was looking to sell off its Bass Strait oil and gas stake.

(Reuters) -  Uber Technologies Inc  (N:UBER) on Monday said it would continue operating its revenue-generating food delivery business Uber Eats even if its ride-hail business should be forced shut in California at the end of this week following a court order.
A company spokesman said Uber's food delivery unit did not appear to be impacted by a lawsuit filed by California's attorney general and a subsequent court order that would force Uber to treat its ride-hail drivers as employees.
Uber and smaller rival  Lyft  Inc (O:LYFT) said they would be forced to shut their ride-hailing operations in California if the court ruling goes into effect on Friday morning.
Eats has been a boon to Uber during the pandemic as Americans stay home and many businesses and restaurants remain shut. Delivery orders in the second quarter more than doubled, while ride-hailing trip bookings, in the past responsible for nearly two-thirds of Uber's revenue, were down 75% from last year.
California represents 9% of Uber's global rides and Eats gross bookings, but a negligible amount of adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, Uber said in November. Lyft, which only operates in the U.S. and does not have a food delivery business, on Wednesday said California makes up some 16% of total rides.
Both companies said California was among the U.S. markets recovering the slowest from the pandemic.
California accuses Uber and Lyft of violating a new state law making it harder to treat ""gig"" workers as independent contractors.
A state court judge on Aug. 10 blocked Uber and Lyft from classifying drivers as contractors, an order that will take effect after midnight on Friday morning.
Uber and Lyft have filed appeals, but it remains unclear if the higher court will issue a decision before the Thursday evening deadline.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The California Air Resources Board (CARB) and major automakers on Monday confirmed they had finalized binding agreements to cut vehicle emissions in the state, defying the Trump administration's push for weaker curbs on tailpipe pollution.
The agreements with carmakers, including Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co, Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p), Honda Motor Co and BMW AG, were first announced in July 2019 as voluntary measures, prompting anger from U.S. President Donald Trump.
A month later, the Justice Department opened an antitrust probe of the agreements, only to end it without action.
The administration in March finalized a rollback of U.S. vehicle emissions standards to require 1.5% annual increases in efficiency through 2026, well below the 5% annual increases in discarded rules under President Barack Obama.
The Center for Biological Diversity estimates the deal will improve fuel economy 3.7% year over year between 2022-2026.
Volvo Cars, owned by China's Geely Holdings, also finalized its agreement on Monday. 
CARB said the deal will cut vehicle greenhouse gas emissions through 2026 and ""encourage innovation to accelerate the transition to electric vehicles, provide industry the certainty needed to make investments and create jobs, and save consumers money.""
The White House did not comment.
The 13 states that follow California's standards, which represent about 40% of the U.S. auto market, have said they support the agreements.
In May, a group of 23 U.S. states led by California and some major cities challenged the Trump vehicle emissions rule.
Other major automakers like General Motors Co (NYSE:GM), Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV and  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp did not join the California agreement.
Those companies also sided with the administration in a separate lawsuit over whether the federal government can strip California of the right to set zero emission vehicle requirements.
Ford said the deal will support ""and incentivize the production of electrified products, and create regulatory certainty."" Honda said the agreement will allow it to sell ""a single nationwide fleet... that achieves substantial annual emissions improvements.""

(Reuters) - The Nasdaq surged to a record high close on Monday, while the S&P 500 approached its own record level, with both indexes lifted by Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and other technology stocks. 
The benchmark S&P 500 reached just shy of its Feb. 19 intraday record high after testing that level for much of last week, while the Dow Jones was weighed down by losses in financial and industrial stocks.
 Nvidia Corp  was among the top boosts to the S&P 500 and Nasdaq for the day, surging 6.7% to a record high after two analysts raised their price targets ahead of the chipmaker's quarterly results on Wednesday.
In June, the Nasdaq became the first of the major Wall Street indexes to recoup its coronavirus-induced losses as several of its largest constituents, including Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX), benefited from curbs on social activity.
""Tech is the only trade,"" said Jake Dollarhide, chief executive officer of Longbow Asset Management in Tulsa, Oklahoma. ""Things that were 10 years away on Feb. 18 are here now: Distance learning, seeing your doctor via Zoom, ordering pharmaceuticals via the mail.""
Lowe's (NYSE:LOW) Cos Inc and  Home Depot  Inc (NYSE:HD) each rose more than 2% rose ahead of their earnings later in the week. The two home improvement chains are expected to have received a bump to their quarterly sales from consumers looking to do minor repair work while spending more time at home.
The S&P 500 retailing index climbed 1.4%, with heavyweights Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc and  Target  Corp (NYSE:TGT) also set to report results this week.
""Earnings season in general has been much better than expected, but a big part of that is because the expectation has been so low,"" said Willie Delwiche, investment strategist at Baird in Milwaukee.
Rackspace Technology jumped over 10% after Reuters reported Amazon is in early talks to invest in the cloud services provider.
As of Friday, 457 companies in the S&P 500 had posted results, of which 81.4% came in above dramatically lowered expectations, according to Refinitiv data.
Minutes of the Federal Reserve's latest meeting, due on Wednesday, are expected to provide more insight into the central bank's view of an economic recovery, while housing starts data is also on tap.
Caution is expected to seep into markets ahead of the November U.S. presidential vote, as the election season kicks into higher gear with the Democratic National Convention, which runs Monday through Thursday.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.31% to end at 27,844.91 points, while the S&P 500 gained 0.27% to 3,381.99. 
The Nasdaq Composite climbed 1% to 11,129.73, its fifth closing high this month. Seven of the 11 major S&P sectors rose, with technology providing the biggest support to the S&P 500 index.
 Principia Biopharma  (NASDAQ:PRNB) Inc surged 9.3% to a record high after French healthcare firm  Sanofi  (NASDAQ:SNY) SA said it would buy the company for about $3.7 billion.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.22-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.20-to-1 ratio favored advancers.
The S&P 500 posted 29 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 85 new highs and 12 new lows. 

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 7.9 billion shares, compared with the 10.0 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

Investing. com -- The S&P 500 made another attempt at a record on Monday, but ended just shy of the mark, while a rally in tech stocks failed to lift the Dow.
The S&P 500 flirted with its Feb. 19 record high but fell a couple of points below it, closing at 3,383, up 0.3%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.31% and the NASDAQ Composite gained 1%.
This is a big week for retail earnings, with analysts anticipating e-commerce gains at least partially offsetting lower revenue because of Covid-related store closings this spring.
Here are three things that could affect the markets tomorrow:
1. Fear that lack of stimulus could lead to credit losses is weighing on financials
Financials were among Monday's worst-performing sectors following a regulatory filing last week that said Warren Buffett's  Berkshire Hathaway  B (NYSE:BRKb)had pared back some of its bank stock holdings. But investors are also worried about the delay in another round of stimulus that could lead to a worsening of credit quality at major lenders.
So far, damage seems to be contained. On Monday,  American Express  Company (NYSE:AXP) reported its card numbers for July. Consumer card member loans were written off at a rate of 2.6% versus 2.6% for the prior month. Consumer loans 30 days past due were 1.4% of the portfolio versus 1.5% in the prior month. The small business card member loans net write off rate was 2.5% versus 2.4% in June
 Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C) also reported its July card numbers, according to Briefing.com. Credit losses in July were 2.42% versus 2.63% in June but 30-day delinquencies spiked to 7.43% from 1.47%.
2.  Home Depot  sets the tone for retailer earnings this week
Home Depot Inc (NYSE:HD) is expected to report earnings on Tuesday morning, but already the shares were moving higher after the WSJ reported that daily foot traffic since April has been 35% higher than last year, according to Briefing.com. Apparently people spent the pandemic organizing do-it-yourself projects around the home.
The stock has doubled since March. Home Depot kicks off a busy week for retailers, and is seen as setting the tone for the quarter. Analysts tracked by Investing.com see EPS at $3.60 a share on revenue of $34 billion.
3. New York's opening gyms, so what does that mean for exercise stocks? 
New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo has cleared the way for gyms to reopen in the state, which could be welcome news to many exercise enthusiasts who have been cooped up at home or forced to go on road runs and do other outdoorsy distancing-friendly fitness activities. Shares of gym chain  Planet Fitness Inc  (NYSE:PLNT) rose 0.7% on Monday following the announcement.
But the return to the gym isn't deterring investors in at-home bicycle fan favorite  Peloton Interactive Inc  (NASDAQ:PTON), which was up 1.34%.  Nautilus Group Inc  (NYSE:NLS), which also makes fitness equipment, dipped 0.3%. Meanwhile, shares of WW International Inc (NASDAQ:WW), the company formerly known as Weight Watchers, fell 3.1%.

 Principia Biopharma  (NASDAQ:PRNB) jumped 9.4% to a record high after French healthcare firm  Sanofi  (NASDAQ:SNY) SA said it would buy the company for about $3.7 billion.
Barrick Gold (NYSE:GOLD) advanced the most since March, leading a surge in precious-metals miners after Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) added the company to its portfolio.
Gold prices jumped more than 2%, briefly recapturing the $2,000 an ounce perch for the first time in nearly a week, as a renewed drop in Treasury yields pushed investors back toward safe-havens.
The Democratic National Convention kicks off tonight, with Joe Biden to become the party's official nominee.

1259,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 17, 2020 04:00PM ET</span>",U.S. states seek $2.2 trillion from OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma: filings,"By Mike Spector
NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. states claimed they are owed $2.2 trillion to address harm from OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma LP's alleged role in America's opioid epidemic, accusing the drugmaker in new filings of pushing prescription painkillers on doctors and patients while playing down the risks of abuse and overdose.
In filings made as part of Purdue's bankruptcy proceedings that were disclosed on Monday, the states said Purdue, backed by the wealthy Sackler family, contributed to a public health crisis that has claimed the lives of roughly 450,000 people since 1999 and caused strains on healthcare and criminal justice systems. The filings cited more than 200,000 deaths in the U.S. tied directly to prescription opioids between 1999 and 2016.
In large states such as California and New York, claims alone totaled more than $192 billion and $165 billion, respectively. Forty-nine U.S. states, Washington, D.C. and various territories are making the claims. Oklahoma settled litigation with Purdue last year. 
Purdue filed for bankruptcy in 2019 under pressure from more than 2,600 lawsuits brought by cities, counties, states, Native American tribes, hospitals and others. The lawsuits said the company, and in some cases the Sacklers, used deceptive marketing and took other improper steps to flood communities with prescription opioids.
The company and family have denied the allegations and pledged to help combat the opioid epidemic, including by providing addiction treatment drugs and overdose reversal medications under development. 
In response to the state claims, Purdue said it continues to work toward resolving litigation and emerging from bankruptcy, and that it is typical for claims from various creditors to be ""filed in amounts substantially larger than what is ultimately allowed by the court.""
Sackler representatives did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Purdue and the Sacklers have pointed to fentanyl and heroin as more significant culprits in the opioid crisis. States in their filings, though, pointed to National Institute on Drug Abuse research estimating that about 80% of heroin abusers previously took prescription opioids.
In addition to the assertions from states, Purdue faces claims exceeding $18 billion from the U.S. Justice Department on account of potential penalties resulting from criminal and civil investigations.
In filings tied to Purdue's bankruptcy case, federal prosecutors said Purdue contributed to false claims being made to federal healthcare insurance programs by allowing doctors to write medically unnecessary opioid prescriptions that were at times tainted by illegal kickbacks, according to a person familiar with the matter. 
The Justice Department claims also included possible penalties arising from allegations that Purdue violated the U.S. Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and violations of federal conspiracy and anti-kickback laws, the person said.
The Justice Department has declined to comment on the claims.
Claims from states and federal prosecutors are being processed after being filed just before a July 30 deadline set by a U.S. bankruptcy judge. While they will collectively exceed trillions of dollars, the filings are in many cases placeholders as opposed to roadmaps for how much money Purdue will ultimately pay its creditors, the bulk of which are U.S., state and local governments.
Purdue is only worth a bit more than $2 billion if liquidated. The company values a proposal to settle litigation, which includes providing addiction treatment and overdose-reversing drugs, at more than $10 billion. The Sacklers would contribute $3 billion and cede control of Purdue, with the company becoming a trust run on behalf of plaintiffs.
Those financial realities underscore that Purdue does not have enough money to satisfy the myriad claims against it.

States and other litigants are in talks to determine how to allocate proceeds from Purdue’s bankruptcy estate as part of the company’s attempted reorganization. Many states, including Massachusetts, New York and Connecticut, have opposed Purdue’s settlement offer, insisting the Sacklers contribute more money and reveal more details about their finances.

Toyota said its Mobility Services Platform will enable it to process and analyze data that can be used to develop vehicle services from ride and car sharing to behavior-based insurance and maintenance notifications.
The deal is an expansion of Amazon Web Services' existing collaboration with Toyota, and marks the e-commerce giant's expanding foray into the transportation business.
In July, AWS announced it was expanding a partnership with Germany's Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p) to help develop the automaker's cloud-based software and data portal into an industry-wide marketplace where business customers can buy and sell industrial applications.

In the automotive sector, AWS previously has partnered with automotive suppliers such as Aptiv (NYSE:APTV), Panasonic (OTC:PCRFY) Corp and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) Corp, big transportation providers such as Uber (NYSE:UBER) and Avis, and self-driving heavy truck startups Embark and China's TuSimple.

At a news conference on Saturday, when asked if he was considering a ban on other Chinese-owned companies including Alibaba to follow that on social video app TikTok, U.S. President Donald Trump said: ""Well, we're looking at other things, yes.""
The White House has been piling pressure on Chinese-owned entities in the run in to elections this year and financial markets are watching closely for signs of whether it will lead to further tit-for-tat moves that could hamper a global recovery.
A number of analysts stressed that Alibaba's so far minimal presence in U.S. markets - it gets only 7% of revenue from sales outside China - may insulate it more than TikTok owner Bytedance from any U.S. attack. 
After a weak start, shares in Alibaba rose 0.8% in a rising New York market.
""Obviously it will have some effect, we could see a decrease in Alibaba's stock price,"" said Luke Lloyd, wealth adviser and investment strategist at Strategic Wealth Partners. 
""But a lot of investors right now don't think there is going to be a lot of bite (from Trump). The company is growing, it is cheaper than its competitors like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and we view (it) as the Amazon of China so there is immense growth potential.""
Alibaba is set to report results on Thursday with analysts expecting the company to benefit from increasing online sales in China in June, although there are nerves about its forecast following unexpectedly poor Chinese retail sales numbers last week.

JD.com beat analysts' estimates for quarterly revenue on Monday, as more customers used its online platform to shop for groceries and other essentials in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, sending its shares up 5%.

He then joined  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), running several of the German lender's trading businesses in Asia before being elected to Britain's parliament in 2010.

(Reuters) - Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) said on Monday it had expanded a program that provides parts and training to independent repair shops to cover its Mac computers.
Apple initially launched the program last year, but it only covered iPhones, the company's biggest-selling product. Mac users previously either had to use Apple or an authorized warranty service provider to get fixes with parts directly from Apple.
Apple last month reported an uptick of 21.6% in quarterly Mac sales to $7 billion, as many employees shifted to working from home. Its market share grew to 7.3% in the second quarter from 6.3% a year earlier, according to research firm IDC.
""When a device needs repairs, we want people to have access to a safe and reliable solution — this latest expansion joins the thousands of repair locations we’ve added over the past year,"" Jeff Williams (NYSE:WMB), Apple’s chief operating officer, said in a statement. ""We’re looking forward to bringing that convenient and trustworthy repair experience to our Mac users.”
Apple's shift in repair practices came after years of calls from right-to-repair groups who had criticized the company for, among other things, only providing genuine parts and training manuals to firms such as Best Buy Inc that were to do warranty-related work on its devices. Smaller shops argued that program was too costly to join due to volume commitments. 
With the independent repair program, Apple began offering to sell parts and provide free training courses to independent shops to perform out-of-warranty work.
Nathan Proctor, head of the U.S. Public Research Interest Group right-to-repair campaign, said the addition of Mac's program was a ""welcome"" step, but the agreement for independent shops reported by publication Vice https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/qjdjnv/apples-independent-repair-program-is-invasive-to-shops-and-their-customers-contract-shows showed ""onerous"" terms.
""At the end of the day, we either have a free market to fix the devices we own, or we don't,"" Proctor said in a statement.

Apple on Monday said it has updated its materials and training for the program based on feedback from independent shops and other interested parties.

The COVID-19 pandemic forced BA to bring forward the retirement of the 747, which with its humped fuselage and four engines is the world's most easily recognized jetliner. The airline said in July they would all go with immediate effect.
BA's first jumbo to face the scrapyard, registration G-CIVD, first entered service in 1994 and last flew in April, when mid-lockdown it flew back from Lagos, Nigeria as part of the UK's repatriation efforts.
The 747 democratised global air travel in the 1970s, but fell behind modern twin-engine aircraft and now trails newer planes in fuel efficiency, making it expensive to run, particularly during the current travel slump.
BA, owned by IAG (L:ICAG), has said it is fighting for its survival due to coronavirus and needs to axe as many as 12,000 staff.

Restrictions on travel between the UK and popular destinations in the United States and India have wiped out BA's most lucrative international routes, while demand for European flights has also waned due to British quarantine rules.

The benchmark S&P 500 has surged 54% since a coronavirus-driven crash in March as investors piled into equities on the back of historic fiscal and monetary stimulus, but soaring unemployment and a deep economic recession have so far kept the index from reclaiming its all-time high.
With U.S. gross domestic product plunging at its steepest pace since the Great Depression in the second quarter, Goldman said investors were more focused on a recovery in 2021, when it expects GDP to rise by 6.4% and earnings for S&P 500 companies to jump 30%.
Analysts polled by Refinitiv expect earnings for the companies to rise 28.3% next year following a 20.3% plunge in 2020.

A part of the stock market jump will also be powered by lower ""equity risk premiums"", which are a combination of expected economic growth and investor confidence, as traders shrug off simmering U.S.-China tensions and uncertainties linked to the U.S. presidential elections in November, strategists at the Wall Street bank said.

Financial terms of the transaction were not disclosed.
Backed by investors including SoftBank Group (T:9984), Kabbage started out in 2009 as an online lender, although it has since broadened its offering into other financial services for small businesses.
Building on its corporate cards strength, AmEx has been focused on growing its offering for small business clients into complementary areas such as payments and cash flow technology solutions, the company's president of global commercial services, Anna Marrs, told Reuters.
This is the second acquisition which AmEx has made in recent months, as part of this strategy, Marrs added. AmEx announced in July 2019 it would buy digital payments firm acompay.
Under the terms of the deal, AmEx will acquire the technology, people and data of Kabbage, although not its loan book, according to a statement.
During the coronavirus pandemic, Kabbage has been heavily involved in the Paycheck Protection Program, the U.S. government's small business stimulus program. The company said last month it had issued 225,000 approved loans for nearly $6 billion, making it the third-largest lender by application volume.

Lenders which used technology to improve the loan process expanded rapidly in the years since the financial crisis, although the recent economic uncertainty has put some under pressure. Last month, Enova International (N:ENVA) said it would purchase OnDeck Capital.

(Reuters) - Lowe's Co Inc (N:LOW) is expected to edge past rival  Home Depot  (N:HD) with what could be its biggest growth in quarterly same-store sales in at least a decade, benefiting from its exposure to customers ready to splurge on do-it-yourself home renovations.
Sellers of paint, tools and gardening equipment have been among the winners since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, as people take up more repair and remodeling projects themselves while hunkered down at home.
But business for handymen, carpenters or professional contractors, who tend to shop more at Home Depot, has slowed.
Lowe's is expected to post same-store sales growth of 11.7% when its reports its May-July quarter results, while Home Depot, scheduled to report on Tuesday, is expected to post a 10.2% rise.
""Lowe's should outperform Home Depot handily,"" Wedbush Securities analyst Seth Basham said, estimating that about 75% of Lowe's total sales come from DIY customers, compared with about 55% for Home Depot.
Still, both have continued to invest in pulling in high-spending building contractors, as U.S. homebuilding jumps amid rising demand for housing in suburban and rural areas.
The rush to the suburbs, as more companies allow work-from-home, has been a boost for Lowe's, which has a majority of its stores located in those areas.

To be sure, Lowe's is a long way from overtaking its rival in total revenue or profit.
""We're expecting Lowe's to beat estimates, but the one challenge they have against Home Depot is their margins. Their sales are coming through, but they need better margins to compete,"" said Jim Boothe, chief investment officer of Brentview Investment Management, which holds a stake in Lowe's.

ABUJA/LAGOS (Reuters) - The World Bank is unlikely to approve a much-needed $1.5 billion for Nigeria in August as planned due to concerns over desired reforms, three sources familiar with the talks told Reuters.
A delay in financing from multilateral lenders could leave Africa's biggest economy and top oil producer, battered by low crude prices, unable to fully finance a record 10.8 trillion naira ($28.35 billion) budget. The central bank has said Nigeria's balance of payments gap this year will be $14 billion. 
The World Bank, which has said Nigeria could be heading toward its greatest fiscal crisis in 40 years, had aimed to bring the loan to its board for approval this month, but the sources said negotiations over what Nigeria will do to secure it were incomplete. 
""They are not convinced about the reforms,"" a source close to the government said. All three sources declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the negotiations. The source added that the currency was the core issue. 
World Bank loans are often contingent upon reforms. It has not outlined any demands, but said previously that it was ""recommending"" a more unified, flexible exchange rate. Fuel subsidies and electricity tariffs are also being discussed. 
Another banking source said the loan could now not be approved until October. 
Nigeria's finance ministry directed queries to the World Bank. In a statement, the lender said discussions were at an advanced stage, but confirmed that it had not presented the loan to its board.
""Of particular importance are the steps the government is taking to marshal the needed fiscal resources for a pro-poor response to the crisis and undertake the reforms that will help ensure a robust recovery,"" the statement said. 
Nigeria's policy of supporting the naira has become more costly since the oil price slide, as it relies on oil for 90% of its foreign exchange. It has devalued the naira twice this year, but the sources said that was not enough for the World Bank, which wanted fuller reform of the naira policy. 
Nigeria also said it had eliminated fuel subsidies through a ""floating"" price cap, but two of the sources said the World Bank felt the mechanism was not sufficiently transparent.

In a 3-0 decision, the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan said it agreed with Costco that its use of the word ""Tiffany"" was unlikely to confuse customers, and that Costco was entitled in good faith to describe the style of its rings even if confusion were likely.
Tiffany had sued Costco on Valentine's Day in 2013 for trademark infringement, accusing the chain of counterfeiting.
Costco countered that ""Tiffany"" had become a generic term, and that it had removed ""Tiffany"" from store signage within one week of being contacted by that company.
The appeals court returned the case to a federal district court for a new trial.
Lawyers for Tiffany and Costco did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Tiffany sued to protect its brand and cachet as one of the world's best-known luxury retailers.
An estimated 3,349 customers bought Tiffany-set rings at Costco during the relevant period.

The $21 million award included $8.25 million in punitive damages, $11.1 million representing triple Tiffany's lost profit from Costco's alleged infringement, and interest.

1278,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 17, 2020 11:00AM ET</span>",High-Frequency Traders Love Business With Robinhood,"(Bloomberg) -- No one is welcoming the new army of Robinhood day-traders into the stock market more warmly than high-frequency trading firms.The speed traders -- or electronic market makers, if you prefer labels with less baggage -- pay online brokerages like Robinhood Financial for the opportunity to execute their clients’ buy and sell orders. Many of these come from what traditionally were called mom-and-pop traders, but these days they also likely include a large cohort of bored-stepson-living-in-mom’s-basement traders.It’s a practice known as “payment for order flow” and is not without controversy. Many critics suspect the reason these sophisticated firms actually pay brokerages to perform this chore for them is because their algorithms are champing at the bit to take advantage of those known in polite company as “uninformed investors” and in impolite company as “dumb money.”
Whatever you call them, one thing is clear: The computer whizzes are willing to pay a premium for orders from Robinhood.
Firms like Citadel Securities and Virtu Financial (NASDAQ:VIRT) Inc. paid Robinhood an average of about 17 cents for every 100 shares executed in the second quarter, according to an analysis by Bloomberg Intelligence’s Larry Tabb. That’s 19% more than the average paid to all the brokerages he looked at, and second only to TradeStation. They paid even more to Robinhood in the first quarter, when its 23-cent payments were the most for the group and 48% above average.Despite the decrease in the per-share rate, the total payments Robinhood received in the second quarter doubled from the first to $180.1 million as stock-trading fever swept across a locked-down nation and turned the pioneer of the commission-free world into the largest U.S. equity broker, Tabb’s report shows. The next biggest payments were $110 million to E*Trade Financial (NASDAQ:ETFC) Corp. and $101 million each to TD Ameritrade’s brokerage and clearing units.
Overall, the boom in retail trading -- up more than 200% over last year -- caused Bloomberg Intelligence to raise its 2020 forecast for total payments for order flow to $2.3 billion from $2 billion.Tabb doesn’t buy the criticism that market makers pay the most for orders they deem to be the “dumbest.” Rather, he said over email, the value of the order flow is linked to the size of the trades. Smaller orders are less likely to have an impact on market prices, and hence are more valuable to firms looking to execute them.“So Robinhood getting higher rebates is probably more aligned to the smaller size of their orders rather than the uninformed nature of their flow or how ‘stupid’ their investors are -- if they are stupid at all,” he said.
A spokesperson for Robinhood agreed that the size of its client orders -- the vast majority are under 100 shares -- are less risky, and therefore more valuable, to market makers. The type of stocks traded on the platform can affect how much they get paid in rebates, since they earn a fixed percentage of the bid-ask spread and volatile stocks trade with wider spreads. The heightened volatility of the first half of 2020 caused spreads to widen significantly, so it’s possible that the rates they are paid could go down if markets remain more calm and spreads narrow.
Tabb’s analysis also offers food for thought for critics of the practice of payment for order flow. The wholesalers making the payments are often able to find better prices than what traders saw on their screens when they pushed the button. That’s known as “price improvement” and for the top six wholesalers it amounted to an almost $1.6 billion boost to the benefit of brokerage clients in the first half of the year, according to Tabb.
Robinhood customers alone received more than $1 billion in price improvement in the first half of 2020, the spokesman said.Maybe it’s time to start thinking of these “Flash Boys” as simply members of Robinhood’s Band of Merry Men?

Investing.com --  Applied Therapeutics (NASDAQ:APLT) dropped almost 17% on Monday after disclosing that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has place a partial clinic hold on its ACTION-Kids study.
The FDA has requested additional technical information relating to ensuring that every patient has access to the drug's benefits. The study is currently in the dose range finding segment, and the partial clinical hold does not introduce any disruption to ongoing treatment. 
The ACTION-Galactosemia Kids pediatric registrational study of AT-007 for treatment of galactosemia is meant to evaluate safety, pharmacokinetics, and reduction in the toxic biomarker, galactitol. The study is comprised of a placebo-controlled dose range finding segment evaluating up to seven days of consecutive dosing to determine the optimal dose in children, followed by a placebo-controlled 90-day study evaluating safety and biomarker efficacy.   
The company will work closely with the FDA to resume the study as soon as possible.
Shares are down by more than half since hitting a 2020 high in February.
Earlier this month, Applied Therapeutics reported a loss per share of $1.27, compared to the expected loss of 69 cents per share.

1280,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 17, 2020 10:35AM ET</span>",Apple's 'extreme' app policies give Google defense in Fortnite antitrust suit,"By Paresh Dave
OAKLAND, Calif. (Reuters) - Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google has a better chance than Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) at defeating Fortnite video game maker Epic Games in court over its allegations the two companies breached anti-trust laws. 
Epic sued Google and Apple separately in U.S. district court on Thursday, accusing the companies of using their dominance to charge app developers an ""exorbitant"" 30% fee on sales and impose other restrictions that benefit their own businesses.
Nearly all of the world's smartphones outside restricted markets such as China come with either Google's Play store or Apple's App Store.
But proving Play store rules violate antitrust laws may be more difficult than with the App Store.
While Apple requires all apps be installed through the App Store, Google allows such installation through several different app stores, in one of several key policy differences that could help it beat the allegations of anticompetitive conduct.
Google encourages phone makers to set the Play store as the default, and it erects security roadblocks when users try to download from some other options.
Those practices are drawing scrutiny from U.S. state attorneys general, people familiar with the matter have told Reuters. 
But in the end, alternatives exist, said Nicholas Economides, a New York University economics professor who studies online marketplaces.
""Having other options definitely makes it a bit harder to say something is anticompetitive,"" Economides said, speaking generally about app stores.
""With Apple, things are extreme because there's no alternative whatsoever. That makes for a stronger potential case.""
Google spokesman Dan Jackson said that most Android phones were sold with multiple app stores installed.
He added that the Play store, in contrast to the App Store, allowed users to access apps paid for elsewhere, without requiring developers to include an in-app purchase option for potential new customers that is subject to the 30% fee. 
Google also allows apps to encourage customers to make purchases outside of the app to avoid the fee.
Its greater flexibility last year enabled dating apps maker Match Group (NASDAQ:MTCH), for instance, to start offering its own payment tools in Tinder on the Play store - a tactic barred on the App Store.
Match spokeswoman Vidhya Murugesan expressed support for Epic Games' lawsuit against Apple, but declined to comment on Epic's Google filing.
The Netherlands' competition regulator last year found as part of an investigation of app stores that Apple's enforcement of its rules ""is stricter"" than Google's, ""and, as such, the complaints of app providers focus mostly on Apple.""
Developers are more reliant on Apple, with roughly 70% of U.S. app revenue coming from App Store users.
Epic did fine financially when it removed Fortnite from the Play Store for a recent 18-month period and directed users to alternative stores, said Shili Shao, who researched app stores over the last year at Yale University's Thurman Arnold Project for antitrust studies. 
""Epic has a weaker argument against Google because they have not been constrained as much,"" Shao said.
Many apps are accustomed to Google collecting fees because they sell ads using its ads software, which collects fees as high as 40%. Developers do not have a comparable relationship with Apple. 
The ad business also affords Google a unique way to appease frustrated developers.
While refusing to budge on the 30% app sales fee, Google offered Epic ""preferential terms"" on sponsorships and cloud services, according to its lawsuit.
Epic rejected the concession but rival Activision Blizzard Inc (NASDAQ:ATVI) took it, the lawsuit said. 

Activision, which did not respond to a request to comment, signed a multi-year strategic partnership with Google in January.

1285,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 17, 2020 09:36AM ET</span>",Stocks - Wall Street Opens Higher on House Price Surge; Dow up 36 Pts,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets started the week in positive mode, as participants took encouragement from data showing the strength of the housing market in July and downplayed fresh signs elsewhere of the economic recovery flattening out.
By 9:35 AM ET (1335 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 36 points, or 0.1%, at 27,967, while the S&P 500 was up 0.3% and the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.6%. 
Earlier, the National Association of Home Builders said its housing market index matched its all-time high of 78 in July, rising much more sharply than expected. That overshadowed a significant weakening in the Empire State Manufacturing index, which fell to a level of 3.7 from 17.2 in July. New orders slumped particularly alarmingly but the employment component of the index held up.
The news from the NAHB supported names such as  Home Depot  (NYSE:HD) stock, which rose 1.9% to an all-time high, and home-builder  Lennar  (NYSE:LEN), which also hit an all-time high with a gain of 1.2%.
Elsewhere, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock rose another 4.4%, adding another $13 to its market capitalization, on the back of a price target upgrade from Wedbush Securities, which it put down to signs of accelerating sales growth in China. Figures from the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers suggest that Tesla sold over 11,000 cars in China in July, grabbing a bigger share of a market that is actually expected to shrink this year due to the phase out of subsidies. Almost all of the cars sold were the Model 3, which generates the lowest profit margin of all the company's models.
The market seemed largely untroubled by the increasing amount of noise generated by political arguments, which centered at the weekend around the role of the U.S. Postal Service. House Democrats intend to hear testimony from Postmaster-General Louis DeJoy over his handling of the service, amid allegations that President Trump is denying it the funding to ensure it can handle the big expected increase in postal ballots at November's election. Trump himself linked his refusal to approve funds to the election in comments last week, before walking them back on Fox Business News on Monday morning.
Elsewhere, airline stocks fell after a stock exchange filing from Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) at the weekend showing that the U.S.'s most famous value investor had cut his losses on them, dropping United, Southwest, American and Delta from the company's portfolio.
United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) stock fell 4.0%, while American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) stock fell 3.1%. One of Buffett's new picks,Barrick Gold (NYSE:GOLD), soared over 10% by contrast, 
In other markets, Gold Futures too received a lift from Buffett's seal of approval, rising 1.8% to within $15 of the $2,000 level.  U.S. crude futures, meanwhile, reversed overnight losses to trade up 1.1%. Both commodities were helped by a weaker dollar: the dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of developed market currencies, fell 0.3% to 92.82, testing the two-year low it made earlier in August."
1286,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 17, 2020 09:30AM ET</span>",China's JD.com posts upbeat results as online orders surge,"(Reuters) - China's JD.com Inc (O:JD) beat analysts' estimates for quarterly sales on Monday, as the firm benefited from a shift in shopping habits of domestic consumers who have largely moved to online ever since the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic.
U.S.-listed shares of the e-commerce company rose 5% in trading before the bell.
The results coincide with growing tensions between Beijing and Washington. Several Chinese companies are putting off plans for U.S. listings amid tensions between the world's top two economies, while those listed in New York are seeking to return to exchanges closer to home. In June, JD raised about $3.87 billion in its Hong Kong secondary listing.
JD executives did not offer any comments on U.S.-China tensions on a conference call with analysts on Monday.
China, which has under a thousand active COVID-19 cases currently, has largely emerged out of lockdowns but demand is still picking up in many sectors.
Retail sales in the world's second-largest economy slipped in July, dashing expectations for a modest rise, as consumers failed to shake off wariness about the coronavirus, while the factory sector's recovery struggled to pick up pace.
The company's net product revenue, which includes online retail sales, rose 33.5% to 178.19 billion yuan in the second quarter.
Net income attributable to shareholders rose to 16.45 billion yuan from 618.8 million yuan a year earlier.
The company's total net revenue rose 33.8% to 201.1 billion yuan ($28.98 billion) in the quarter ended June 30. Analysts on average had expected revenue of 190.95 billion yuan, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

EasyJet said in May that it would need to axe 4,500 jobs across Europe to prepare for a smaller travel market due to the pandemic, and is starting that contraction by closing bases at London Stansted, London Southend and Newcastle airports.
The outlook for airlines darkened last week after France joined Spain on Britain's quarantine list, deterring travel to the two most popular destinations for Britons and dashing hopes for an August recovery.
EasyJet's bigger rival Ryanair (I:RYA) said on Monday that it would reduce its flight capacity by a further 20% during September and October after a reimposition of travel restrictions led to a notable weakness in forward bookings.
Johan Lundgren, chief executive of easyJet, blamed ""the unprecedented impact of the pandemic and related travel restrictions"" for the base closures and said in a statement that Britain's quarantine measures were affecting demand.
Up to 670 pilots and crew work at the three bases and many of those will lose their jobs. They will make up some of the 1,900 jobs in Britain that easyJet flagged in May would go as part of the 4,500 European total.
An easyJet spokeswoman said that it was likely that fewer than 1,900 jobs would actually be lost in the UK due to agreements on part time and seasonal contracts, base transfers and unpaid leave. There will also be less compulsory job cuts due to agreements on voluntary redundancy.

Under the deal, Diageo will also own other brands in the Davos Brands' portfolio, including Astral Tequila, Sombra Mezcal and TYKU Sake, with Reynolds retaining an ownership interest in Aviation American Gin.
The move comes just two weeks after the maker of Johnnie Walker whisky and Smirnoff vodka posted a yearly profit that nearly halved as widespread closures of pubs and restaurants, cancellation of sporting events and a plunge in duty free sales hit global demand.
The company isn't new to acquiring brands owned by famous Hollywood celebrities. In 2017, it paid $1 billion in total to acquire the super premium tequila brand, Casamigos, that was co-founded by ""Ocean's Eleven"" star George Clooney. [https:// The deal also comes at a time when consumption of gin has been rising in the United States. According to the Distilled Spirits Council, distillers sold nearly 10 million 9-liter cases of gin in the United States in 2019, generating $918 million in revenue, a 3% rise over 2018. Aviation American Gin grew volumes at over 100% in 2019, adding the highest number of cases and contributing 40% of super premium gin segment growth in the United States, Diageo said in a statement.  Aviation American will join Diageo's wide ranging portfolio of gins, that include Tanqueray and Gordon's. Shares of Diageo were up 0.7% at 2620.5 pence in afternoon trading.

Europe's biggest budget airline, which increased flights to 60% of its normal schedule this month after resuming services in July, said the cuts will be heavily focused on France, Ireland, Spain and Sweden and mostly involve frequency reductions rather than route closures.

1292,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 17, 2020 07:15AM ET</span>","Walmart results expected to show improved margins, online sales","By Aishwarya Venugopal and Melissa Fares
(Reuters) - Walmart Inc's (N:WMT) margins and online sales are expected to benefit in the second quarter as the largest U.S. retailer cashed in on shoppers using government stimulus checks to buy higher-priced products like sneakers and toys along with daily essentials.
The majority of stimulus money went to housing, savings and grocery bills, according to an IRI consumer survey. Retailers including Walmart also experienced a surge in sales of items like electronics and clothes in the second quarter. Those bigger-ticket items are expected to help Walmart's margins.
""Unlike other retailers, we believe Walmart took most of the pain in Q1, limiting the Q2 impact,""  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) analyst Seth Sigman said in a note last week. One question is how well it will perform compared to big-box competitors like Costco Wholesale Corp (O:COST) and  Target  (N:TGT) that have gained momentum since the start of the pandemic.
Visits to Costco the weeks of July 6th, July 20th, and July 27th all show year-over-year growth, according to Placer.ai, a firm that tracks foot traffic.
Dollar General (N:DG) also saw foot traffic increase the same week unemployment benefits largely expired, on July 31, according to Placer.ai.
Even so, investors give Walmart the edge.
""The way we see consumers right now is they're spending on what they need to spend on - a lot less dining, a lot more eating at home. All of those trends favor Walmart,"" said Randy Hare, portfolio manager at Huntington Private Bank.
Hare highlighted Walmart's investments in areas such as grocery pickup and same-day delivery that helped meet surging demand seen during the lockdowns.
""Walmart has done a lot right in recent years. It's improved execution & successfully changed the narrative of its story from that of a mature brick & mortar retailer to being a viable No. 2 in e-commerce,"" UBS equities analyst Michael Lasser said.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are set to edge higher at the open Monday, with investors still confident about the strength of the U.S. economic recovery despite the fraught political situation reducing the likelihood of additional stimulus in the near future.
At 7:05 AM ET (1105 GMT), US 500 Futures traded 11 points, or 0.4%, higher, the Dow Futures contract rose 70 points, or 0.3%, while Nasdaq 100 Futures gained 82 points, or 0.8%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average cash index has gained over 5% in August, traditionally the weakest month of the year, while the S&P 500 and the NASDAQ Composite have posted gains in three of the last four weeks. The benchmark S&P 500 is just 0.4% away from February’s record close.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) lifted its year-end price target for the S&P 500 on Monday to 3,600 from 3,000, as the relentless rally off the March lows leaves previous predictions out of date. 
Large stimulus injections have fueled the climb in the S&P 500 since the March sell-off sparked by the pandemic. However, a new fiscal boost looks unlikely near term with the two U.S. political parties seemingly far apart over the size and terms of the latest relief bill. 
Additionally, the Democratic national convention starts on Monday, traditionally the starting point for November’s presidential election, suggesting that least some policymakers may have other things on their minds.
In corporate news, while the second-quarter earnings season is mostly over, major retailers are yet to post results, although not on Monday. 
Walmart (NYSE:WMT),  Home Depot  (NYSE:HD), Kohls (NYSE:KSS), Lowe's (NYSE:LOW),  Target  (NYSE:TGT) are among the retailers on deck, with industrial Deere (NYSE:DE) & Co set to wrap up the week.
As of Friday, 457 companies in the S&P 500 have posted results, of which 81.4% have come in above a decidedly low expectations bar, according to Refinitiv data.
Meanwhile, the Covid-19 virus continued to cause havoc, with the United States surpassing 170,000 coronavirus deaths over the weekend, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. 
Oil prices edged lower Monday, after hitting new post-pandemic highs over the weekend, amid caution ahead of this week’s meeting of the OPEC+ producer bloc to discuss production levels.
The group has a tricky job ahead - increasing supply even as demand remains substantially below last year’s levels - without crashing prices.
China and the U.S. postponed a meeting originally scheduled for the weekend to review their January phase one trade deal, saving both sides the embarrassment of acknowledging that China isn't buying anywhere close to the volumes of U.S. products it promised to buy in January.
U.S. crude futures traded 0.1% lower at $41.97 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract fell 0.3% to $44.69.

In the previous week shopper numbers, or footfall, grew 3.8% - with traffic boosted by the start of a state-funded eating out scheme designed to get Britons spending again.
The country's retailers, already struggling with high rents, business taxes, tight margins and online competition, have been hammered by the coronavirus lockdown. Thousands of job losses have already been announced.
Springboard said footfall last week was down 0.5% on UK high streets. However, it was up 1.9% in retail parks and up 2.4% in shopping centres - the former being open air and easy to access and the latter benefiting from being climate controlled.
""The first week of the peak summer holiday period delivered spectacularly hot weather but largely lacklustre footfall performance,"" said Springboard director Diane Wehrle.
""Customer activity across UK retail destinations rose marginally from the week before but the uplift was less than a third of the increase recorded in the previous week.""
On a year-on-year basis total footfall at all UK destinations was down 32.5% last week, the researcher added.

Surveys published last week showed consumer spending remains far below normal levels.

1297,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 17, 2020 05:41AM ET</span>",StockBeat: Rippling Pandemic Keeps Markets Under Pressure,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- Europe’s stock markets remained stuck in the dog days of summer on Monday, as the continent struggled to contain a second wave of Coronavirus cases, while threats of geopolitical instability in Belarus and the Eastern Mediterranean also continue to drag on sentiment.
New case numbers in Europe remain well below those witnessed in the first devastating wave of the pandemic in the spring. The EU and U.K. as a whole registered barely 10,000 cases on Sunday, compared with over 42,000 in the U.S. (which has only three-quarters the population of the EU and U.K.)
However, the pandemic’s trajectory in Europe has worsened sharply in recent weeks, amid signs of fatigue with social distancing. Over the weekend, Spain and Italy were forced to order the renewed closure of nightclubs, while Germany declared all of Spain to be a risk area, with the exception of the Canary Islands.
France’s public health authorities, chastened by the U.K.’s decision last week to impose quarantine requirements on all travelers returning from the country, acknowledged that all of the country’s main indicators were going the wrong way, with the cities of Paris and Marseille notable hotspots.
To an extent, the authorities have accepted this development when they loosened travel restrictions back in June, implicitly acknowledging that they needed to allow people at least a temporary reprieve to guarantee public consent for what is still likely to be a year-long disruption of public life.
What has happened so far doesn’t make that a bad judgment. With the exception of Spain, where case numbers are elevated across most of the country – including non-tourist areas – most of the latest outbreaks in Europe are localized, attributable to specific elements of local demographics and economic life.
But it does press the question of where the next leg up in European stocks is going to come from. A sharp rebound in output in the third quarter is already priced in, but the outlook beyond that timeframe is still extremely murky.
By 5:30 AM ET (0930 GMT), the Stoxx 600 was up 0.3% at 369.08. Momentum generated by the initial policy response to the crisis has faded completely, and it’s now nearly a month since it last posted a post-pandemic high. Spain’s IBEX 35 was down 0.6% and is now down over 10% from its June high. Melia Hotels (MC:MEL) stock was down 7.0% on the prospect of losing German tourists for the rest of the summer, in addition to British ones. Such outperformance as stood out was due to factors that had little or nothing to do with the situation in Europe: London-listed miners led the way on hopes that the latest Chinese monetary easing would support demand for steel - something that appeared to be flagging in last week's disappointing industrial production data.
The market, in short, remains dependent on the path of the pandemic. There is no lasting rally in sight for the former without victory over the latter.

The national carrier said the Central Bankruptcy Court required two additional hearings to complete proceedings. The hearings are scheduled for Aug. 20 and Aug. 25 and more evidence will be presented. 
""The hearings are promising and went smoothly,"" Acting President Chansin Treenuchagron said in a statement. The airline submitted its bankruptcy and restructuring petition in May, giving it a stay on debt repayment. 
""Only seven lawyers from minority creditors opposed the plan, but this is not troubling because (their objections) are issues that Thai Airways can clarify,"" he said, without giving details. 
The court will have to approve the airline's request for restructuring and a committee that would lay out the plan. 
Thai Airways on Monday said it has nominated a committee of seven - including the company's chairman and acting president, former President Piyasvasti Amranand, veteran banker Boontuck Wungcharoen and EY Corporate Advisory Services Company Limited - to plan the company's restructuring. 
Chansin said the airline had support from major creditors, including the Ministry of Finance, which together account for more than 50% of its debt. 
The Thai government holds a 47.86% stake in the airline.
After the court approves its restructuring proposals, the airline said it will take one to two months to develop its plan before presenting it to creditors. 

Thai Airways told shareholders last month it was confident the court would accept its request.

LONDON/SYDNEY (Reuters) - Shares crept back toward recent peaks on Monday as Chinese markets swung higher, while investors waited to see if the recent sell-off in longer-dated U.S. Treasuries would be extended and perhaps take some pressure off the dollar.
Europe was warming up to the new week slowly but was steady enough to keep MSCI's broadest index of world shares (MIAPJ0000PUS) inching closer to February's record top of 581.02.
Chinese blue chips (CSI300) led the way with gains of 2.35%, as the country's central bank provided more medium term loans to the financial system.
Beijing had also granted a patent for CanSino Biologics (HK:6185) COVID-19 vaccine candidate Ad5-nCOV.
But Tokyo's Nikkei (N225) fell 0.6% as Japan became the latest country to confirm its biggest economic contraction on record.
A retightening of COVID-19 measures in Italy was contributing to Europe's groggy start, although Wall Street S&P 500 futures remained a solid 0.3% higher (ESc1) and just below the record close of 3,386.15.
Rabobank strategist Bas Van Geffen said the past few months had seen optimism build about a strong economic bounce-back, but steps like COVID measures being reimposed were an indication of the challenges. 
""We have already cautioned that this is not going to be a V- shaped recovery ... and perhaps this is a sort of a sign to the markets that it is not going to be (a V-shaped bounce)"". 
The U.S. second-quarter earnings season wraps up with major retailers reporting this week, including Walmart Inc (N:WMT),  Home Depot  Inc (N:HD) and  Kohls Corp  (N:KSS).

U.S. crude oil shipments to China will rise sharply in coming weeks, as the world's two top economies gear up to review their January deal after a prolonged trade war.

EYEING THE FED
The highlight of the economic calendar will be the release of the minutes from the U.S. Federal Reserve's last policy meeting. 
""Market participants will be looking for insight into the details and exact timing of when the Fed's Monetary Policy Review will be completed, and also for more clarity with respect to the potential timing and structure of any changes to forward guidance,"" noted analysts at NatWest Markets.
Speculation is rife the Fed will adapt an average inflation target, which would seek to push inflation above 2% for some time to make up for the years it has run below it.
That combined with massive new debt supply caused a sharp increase in longer-term bond yields last week, with 30-year yields (US30YT=RR) rising 21 basis points as the curve steepened.
The lift in yields gave the dollar some respite after weeks of losses. Against a basket of currencies the dollar was a fraction lower at 93.016 (=USD), still uncomfortably close to the recent trough of 92.521. 
The euro (EUR=) flattened out a little late last week, having met resistance around the two-year peak of $1.1915. Yet it still ended the week with a gain of 0.5% and was last holding at $1.1830 as European yields drifted lower again.
""Investors strategically long EUR/USD should stick to the position,"" said CBA forex analyst Elias Haddad. ""Greater Eurozone fiscal solidarity, real two‑year swap rate differentials and relative central bank balance sheet trends between the Eurozone and the U.S. suggest the fundamental uptrend in EUR/USD is intact.""
The single currency has also made a notable break higher on the yen (EURJPY=) to reach ground not trodden since April 2019. Indeed, the yen fell against most of its peers last week, with the dollar steady at 106.45 yen  on Monday.
In commodity markets, gold firmed to $1,943 an ounce , after the jump in bond yields saw it lose 4.5% last week in its worst performance since March.
Oil prices edged ahead on hopes for Chinese demand and after data showed crude oil, gasoline, and distillate inventories all declined in the week-ending Aug. 7.

Brent crude (LCOc1) futures rose 33 cents to $45.13 a barrel, while U.S. crude (CLc1) gained 38 cent to $42.39.

(Reuters) - European shares were trading flat on Monday as China-exposed miners gained on fresh stimulus for the world's second-largest economy, but growing risks from an uptick in coronavirus cases in the continent weighed on sentiment. 
Travel stocks (SXTP) fell 0.7%, continuing to slide after the United Kingdom added France and other countries to its quarantine list last week. The pan-European STOXX 600 index (STOXX) was unchanged after opening slightly higher.

Germany declared nearly all of Spain, including the tourist island of Mallorca, a coronavirus risk region following a spike in cases there, while Britain on Sunday marked a sixth day of more than 1,000 jump in daily virus cases.
""The trend of growing European new infections looks unlikely to abate for now and could continue to weigh on sentiment,"" analysts at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) wrote in a note.
""We expect travel & leisure to be one of the last sectors to recover from the pandemic,"" they said, adding that travel curbs remain a big potential driver of default risks for the sector. 
Meanwhile, European miners (SXPP) jumped 1.0% after equity markets in China, the world's top metals consumer, were boosted by fresh central bank stimulus. [.SS]
Chipmakers also rose, while luxury group LVMH (PA:LVMH) gained 0.4% after Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) upgraded to ""buy"" and spirits maker  Pernod Ricard  (PA:PERP) added 1.7% after a  Barclays  (LON:BARC) upgrade to ""overweight.""
Markets appeared to be in a holding pattern ahead of the release of August business activity data later this week, which could shed light on the pace of economic recovery, while the U.S. Federal Reserve's policy minutes is also due on Wednesday. 
France's Sanofi (PA:SASY) slipped 0.4% after it agreed to buy U.S. company  Principia Biopharma  Inc (O:PRNB) for around $3.7 billion.
Frankfurt-listed shares of  Novavax  (F:NVV1) (O:NVAX) jumped 6.4% after the U.S. drugmaker said it was starting a mid-stage study of its experimental COVID-19 vaccine in South Africa.

“There is growing evidence that long term nominal yields are making a secular trough with several near term catalysts that may extend last week’s rise,” strategists including Michael Wilson wrote in a note on Monday. “Such a development could prove to be very challenging to many equity portfolios that likely embed higher long duration risk than may be appreciated.”
Ultimately, a selloff in equities would likely kickstart a new bull market in stocks, the note added, as higher long-term yields are usually associated with better economic growth the bank anticipates in the year ahead.
The yield on the U.S. 10-year Treasury bond is up 17 basis points this month, rising to as much as 0.7257% on Thursday, the highest since June, as inflation data starts to show signs that the Federal Reserve’s massive liquidity injections may be lifting economic growth.
A rising 10-year yield would tend to favor stocks in the financial, capital goods, energy and materials sectors, Morgan Stanley said.

David Kostin raised his forecast for the benchmark U.S. gauge to 3,600 from 3,000, joining the likes of Yardeni Research founder Ed Yardeni and RBC Capital Markets’ Lori Calvasina who’ve upped their forecasts in recent weeks. The rally has caught many investors by surprise, with the S&P 500 now sitting at 3,372.85 -- 51% off its March lows -- and threatening to eclipse its February closing record. Kostin cited Goldman’s above-consensus U.S. growth expectations keyed off positive news on the vaccine front.
“As the last few months have demonstrated, equity prices depend on not just the expected future stream of earnings but the rate at which those earnings are discounted to present value,” Kostin wrote in a note Friday. “Looking forward, a falling equity risk premium will outweigh a rise in bond yields, and combined with our above-consensus EPS forecast, will lift the S&P 500 Index to 3,600 by year-end.”
See strategists’ year-end forecasts for the S&P 500, as of mid-July, here.
Large stimulus injections have fueled the climb in the S&P 500 since the March sell-off sparked by the pandemic. The gauge briefly surpassed an all-time high last week, helped by better-than-expected economic and earnings data, and optimism about an early roll out of a vaccine.
Kostin said the U.S. election remains a significant risk to his prediction because of challenges in tabulating results in Covid-19 times. Though “the largest risk to our forecast is the timing of a vaccine and path of recovery from the pandemic,” he said.

1303,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 17, 2020 04:10AM ET</span>",Former KKR dealmaker launches healthcare-focused buyout firm,"By Chibuike Oguh
(Reuters) - Jim Momtazee, a former dealmaker at U.S. buyout firm KKR & Co Inc (N:KKR), has launched his own firm to pursue private equity deals in the healthcare sector.
Momtazee, who spent 21 years at KKR and led its Americas healthcare team for a decade, said in a statement he formed Patient Square Capital together with Maria Walker, a former partner at consulting firm KPMG.
The move comes as the outbreak of the novel coronavirus has strained some healthcare providers, while spurring growth in some sectors such as telemedicine and vaccine production.
Patient Square Capital plans to look for deals across the healthcare industry, including technology-enabled services, biopharmaceuticals, the pharmaceutical value chain, medical devices, diagnostics, providers, digital health and consumer health, the statement said.
""We're going to be broad-based in our focus on all aspects of healthcare, bringing depth of knowledge, scale, expertise, and long-term view to our investments,"" Momtazee told Reuters in an interview.

Prior to leaving KKR last year, Momtazee worked on some of the buyout firm's biggest healthcare deals, including the $33 billion take-private of U.S. hospital operator HCA Healthcare Inc (N:HCA), as well as the acquisition of contract research firm PRA International for $1.3 billion in 2013.

1304,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 17, 2020 03:59AM ET</span>",Stocks - Europe Edge Higher; Miners Benefit From China's Move,"By Peter Nurse 
Investing.com - European stock markets traded marginally higher Monday, helped by China’s central bank injecting liquidity into its financial system but weighed on by fresh coronavirus outbreaks and weak growth data from Japan.
At 4 AM ET (0800 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.2% higher, the CAC 40 in France rose 0.3% and the U.K.'s FTSE index was up 0.4%.
Earlier Monday, China’s central bank added 700 billion yuan ($101 billion) of one-year funding into its financial system via the medium-term lending facility. This was a sign the country’s central bank wants to keep monetary policy very loose to help the economy recover from the coronavirus pandemic.
China’s economy, the second largest in the world, had been the first of the world's big economies to recover from the shock of pandemic-driven lockdowns, but the recovery has shown signs of flattening out of late, with industrial production falling short of expectations and retail sales still below year-earlier levels in July.  
This news contrasts with data showing Japan was hit by its biggest economic contraction on record in the second quarter, as the world's third-largest economy shrank an annualised 27.8% in April-June. Here, as with the U.S. data, the practice of annualization wildly distorts the likely outcome for the year as a whole.
In Europe, fresh outbreaks of the Covid-19 virus caused concern. Over the weekend, Germany's foreign ministry issued a warning about travel to Spain, while France posted its highest daily number of new cases in three months and Italy ordered nightclubs around the country to close again. Late last week the U.K.added France and the Netherlands to its quarantine list.
In corporate news, French healthcare company  Sanofi  (NASDAQ:SNY) agreed to buy U.S. company  Principia Biopharma  (NASDAQ:PRNB) for around $3.7 billion, strengthening Sanofi's presence in research and development areas. Sanofi stock rose 0.1%.
Elsewhere, the mining sector benefited from China’s move, as the Asian giant consumes a lot of the raw materials these companies produce.  Anglo American  (LON:AAL) rose 2.3%, BHP Group (NYSE:BHP) climbed 1.6% and Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO) 1.4%.
Oil prices advanced Monday, following recent signals that supply and demand are returning closer to balance after the coronavirus outbreak and a spat between Saudi Arabia and Russia caused a dramatic oversupply earlier this year.
The U.S. and China postponed talks planned for the weekend aimed at reviewing progress at the six-month mark of their phase-one trade agreement. But China is already expected to import a record 32 million barrels of U.S. oil in August, according to Refinitiv Eikon data, easing concerns that it won’t meet its purchase commitments.
The OPEC+ producer bloc, which also includes Russia, will meet this week in the form of its Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee to discuss production levels.
U.S. crude futures traded 0.5% higher at $42.23 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract rose 0.4% to $44.99. 
Elsewhere, gold futures rose 0.8% to $1,965/oz, continuing to trade in an elevated range just below the $2,000 level. EUR/USD traded 0.1% higher at 1.1850."
1305,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 17, 2020 03:55AM ET</span>",Japan metals manufacturers see pick-up in demand from automakers after first-quarter plunge,"By Yuka Obayashi
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese manufacturers of metals, including steel and aluminium, saw their output plunge in the April-June quarter as automakers temporarily shut factories to curb the spread of the COVID-19 virus and to match slumping demand. 
They expect a gradual pick-up in metals used in automobiles and other industries toward next March, but not enough to bring demand back to pre-pandemic levels, suggesting a smaller annual import of raw materials such as iron ore, coking coal and primary aluminium ingots. 
""Demand for steel used in automobiles will recover from the July-September quarter as automakers are stepping up output, but it won't be back to 100% by March,"" Junichi Akagi, general manager of JFE Steel, Japan's second-biggest steelmaker, said earlier this month.
Crude steel output at the world's No.3 steel producer plunged 31% in the April-June quarter versus a year earlier to 18 million tonnes, according to the Japan Iron and Steed Federation, with orders of ordinal steel from automakers slumping 58% to 920,000 tonnes, the lowest quarterly level since 1971.
The nation's production of aluminium rolled products slid 15% in the quarter, the Japan Aluminium Association said.
With the auto segment accounting for about 20% of steelmakers' local demand, and 15-18% for suppliers of rolled aluminium products, a recovery in car production is a key for the suppliers' recuperation from devastated earnings.
""Our steel output in the October-March second half will rise 20% from the April-September half as industry activities, centred in automobiles, are expected to rebound,"" JFE Holdings (T:5411) President Koji Kakigi said last week.
JFE Steel may restart one of the two blast furnaces which were temporarily suspended to cope with the COVID-19 crisis, in October, Kakigi said.
Nippon Steel (T:5401) President Eiji Hashimoto, also the head of the steel federation, has warned Japan's crude steel output may fall below 80 million tonnes this financial year, the lowest since 1968.
UACJ Corp (T:5741), Japan's biggest aluminium roller, also forecast a recovery in demand from automakers after June, but cited ""uncertainty"" over the outlook.
Faced with collapsing demand for finished metals, Japan's import of raw materials dropped sharply in the April-June quarter, with iron ore dipping 21% year-on-year, coking coal sliding 8% and primary aluminium ingots declining 16%, according to trade data.

If a recent resurgence in Japanese coronavirus infections prompts restrictions in industry activities, a further reduction in imports of these materials is likely, industry experts say.

PARIS (Reuters) - Sanofi SA (PA:SASY) is to buy U.S.-based  Principia Biopharma  Inc (O:PRNB) for around $3.7 billion, the companies announced on Monday, marking the French healthcare company's latest acquisition in the biotech sector.
The deal will strengthen Sanofi's research capabilities in areas such as autoimmune and allergic diseases, the companies said, and will see the French company buy the outstanding shares of Principia for $100 per share in cash.
That represents an aggregate equity value of around $3.68 billion on a fully diluted basis and a premium of 10% to Principia Biopharma's closing price of $90.74 on Aug. 14.
""This acquisition advances our ongoing R&D transformation to accelerate development of the most promising medicines that will address significant patient needs,"" said Sanofi Chief Executive Paul Hudson (NYSE:HUD).
Sanofi shares edged up 0.6% in early session trading, bucking a slight fall in France's CAC-40 index (FCHI), as analysts were positive on the deal.
""We like the relatively low risk value accretion of this deal with longer-term optionality, that fits within the strategy of deploying firepower across numerous bolt-on deals,"" wrote brokerage Jefferies (NYSE:JEF), which kept a 'buy' rating on Sanofi.
Sanofi said it expected to complete the acquisition in the fourth quarter of 2020. 
""The merger will provide global resources to get these novel therapies to patients faster,"" said Martin Babler, president and chief executive at Principia Biopharma.
Sanofi shares are down by around 5% since the start of 2020, whereas the CAC-40 has fallen around 17% this year. 

The acquisition of Principia Biopharma follows the French company's 2018 takeover of U.S. haemophilia treatment specialist Bioverativ for $11.6 billion, and its purchase of biotechnology company Synthorx in December 2019 for around $2.5 billion.

Goods made in Hong Kong for export to the United States will need to be labelled as made in China after Sept. 25, according to a U.S. government notice posted last week.
When asked about the development by CNBC, Yau referred to World Trade Organization rules which state that Hong Kong is entitled to use its own labeling for its exports.
He also said that Hong Kong's growth slowed to an ""unprecedented"" 9% decline in the second quarter.
Yau expressed concerns over escalating U.S.-China tensions, saying that they were distracting from fighting the coronavirus pandemic. 
""As we are fighting the pandemic, I think the last thing one would want is a further distraction that would disturb or disrupt the trade,"" he told CNBC https://cnb.cx/3iQdI5c.

Tensions between Washington and Beijing have been rising over the handling of the coronavirus outbreak, trade war tariffs, China's imposition of its national security law in Hong Kong and the subsequent U.S. decision to end the former British colony's special status under United States law.

""We are currently investigating whether and how Amazon influences how traders set prices on the market-place,"" Andreas Mundt, President of the Federal Cartel Office, told the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung daily.
Germany is Amazon's second-biggest market after the United States.
During the first few months of the COVID-19 pandemic, when many stores were closed and shoppers flocked online, Mundt said there had been complaints that Amazon had blocked some traders because of allegedly overly high prices.
""Amazon must not be a controller of prices,"" he said, adding that Amazon had responded to his office's requests for information and those statements were being evaluated.
The cartel office was not immediately available to comment.
An Amazon spokeswoman said the company's policies were designed to make sure its partners set competitive prices.
""Amazon selling partners set their own product prices in our store,"" the spokeswoman said. ""Our systems are designed to take action against price gouging,"" she said, adding that those who had concerns should contact its support team for its merchants.
Up until 2013, Amazon had prevented traders from offering their products via other online sites at a lower price than on its market place, a policy Germany's anti-trust watchdog forced it to abandon.

Last year, Amazon reached a deal with the German authority to overhaul its terms of service for third-party merchants, prompting the office to drop a previous seven-month investigation.

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Geely Automobile Holdings (OTC:GELYF) Ltd on Monday booked a 43% drop in half-year profit and trimmed its full-year sales goal, sending its shares down 4%, as the coronavirus outbreak continues to trouble the world's biggest auto market.
The results come as China's overall auto sales slowly recovers from a virus-blighted start to the year. Sales climbed for the fourth consecutive month in July yet are still down 12.7% for the year to date.
China's highest-profile automaker - due to group investments in Volvo Cars and  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn) - posted January-June net profit of 2.3 billion yuan ($331.37 million).
It sold 530,446 vehicles, down 19% on year, leaving revenue down 23% at 36.82 billion yuan, meeting analyst estimates.
""Geely's 1H20 earnings are largely in line with our expectation, thanks to its significant cost cut efforts, especially in wages and investments in fixed assets,"" said Haitong International analyst Shi Ji.
However, the automaker knocked 6% from its full-year sales goal to 1.32 million vehicles - down 3% on year - just two weeks after maintaining a target set shortly before China's virus lockdown in January.
Geely's share price fell as much as 4%, versus a 1.5% rise in the benchmark Hang Seng Index.
PLANNED MERGER
Geely has a market capitalisation of about $21.2 billion, eclipsing international peers better known outside of China such as Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV and Nissan (OTC:NSANY) Motor Co Ltd.
Its parent, Zhejiang Geely Holding Group Co Ltd, plans to merge the automaker with affiliate Volvo Cars and list the successor in Hong Kong and possibly Stockholm.
Merger talks were suspended in June, however, while the Hong Kong-listed automaker worked on listing shares on mainland China's Nasdaq-like STAR board.

Geely plans to revamp factories at home and abroad using manufacturing platforms developed with Volvo Cars since 2013. It also aims to start European exports this year of sport-utility vehicle 01 under its premium brand Lynk & Co.

1316,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 16, 2020 06:09PM ET</span>",Hong Kong Exchange Proves Safe Bet in City’s Turbulent Times,"(Bloomberg) -- A top bet this year on Hong Kong’s stock exchange is the Hong Kong stock exchange.
Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing Ltd. has surged 46% in 2020, making it the second-biggest gainer in the benchmark Hang Seng Index.
The jump to a record has been stoked by a flood of share listings by high-profile Chinese companies. The firms are turning to the bourse amid rising political tension with the U.S., and increased scrutiny of Chinese firms, recently culminating in a push by President Donald Trump to rein TikTok owner ByteDance and WeChat’s Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) Ltd.
HKEX’s listing funds rose 49% in the three months through June. It’s now poised to welcome another mega deal by financial technology giant Ant Group. The main source of revenue, trading, is up about 50% from last year after the recent big share deals.
The rush to the exchange “is arguably the most certain story in an uncertain time,” said Hao Hong, chief strategist at Bocom International in Hong Kong.
Jack Ma’s Ant Seeks $200 Billion Value in Landmark Dual IPO (4)
Offset by lower income from derivatives and commodities, the exchange is anticipated to post about a 6% rise in profit in its second-quarter earnings report on Wednesday, according to Bloomberg Intelligence senior analyst Sharnie Wong.
While Hong Kong has been rocked by political turmoil since Beijing revealed in May it was imposing a security law on the city, a flood of Chinese money has helped to stabilize the financial hub. Since early June, flows from mainland bourses in a trading link has doubled from a year earlier, raising speculation over Beijing-directed buying.
The dynamic is likely to sustain gains for the bourse until at least the U.S. November election, Hong said. “Seeing what TikTok is going through, U.S.-listed Chinese stocks are all feeling the imminent danger and making contingency plans,” he said.
A feared capital flight out of Hong Kong has yet to materialize. Many high-net worth investors have been opening accounts abroad, but are as of now sticking it out, betting Chinese support will deliver gains and stability back to the protest-rocked city. The city’s financial chief, Paul Chan, has sought to reassure that businesses will continue as usual, urging the industry not to worry about any curbs on such things as short selling and writing research reports.
H.K. SFC Says Security Law Has No Impact on Market Information
The exchange’s fortunes are also on the mind of the U.S. president after he rescinded the city’s special trading status and sanctioning a number of officials over their roles in the security law. “Hong Kong markets are going to go to hell, no one is going to do business in Hong Kong anymore,” he said in a Thursday interview on Fox Businesses.
Unicorn Search
China’s long-term commitment to propping up Hong Kong also isn’t a given. Authorities are opening their financial markets and keen on building up local exchanges, making it easier to list in Shanghai and Shenzhen, posing a challenge.
Ant Group is pulling off a dual listing, with the largest part of cash expected to be raised in Shanghai. Beijing has also dragged its feet on allowing  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Inc.’s Hong Kong shares to trade on the mainland stock link. The bourse scored a big coup last year in luring the tech behemoth to do a $13 billion dual listing in Hong Kong, adding to one in New York.
While only a year old, Shanghai’s STAR Board has attracted a number of Hong Kong-listed companies to raise or seek to cash, among them Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. and Geely Automobile Holdings (OTC:GELYF) Ltd. SenseTime Group Ltd., China’s largest artificial intelligence company, is also exploring a dual listing in Hong Kong and China as it closes in on $1.5 billion of pre-IPO financing.
HKEX to Woo Chinese Unicorns, Connect Boost: Company Outlook
For the time being, Hong Kong has an advantage with an abundance of derivatives for hedging not available on the mainland as well as well as longer trading hours. Alex Wong, asset management director at Ample Capital Ltd., said that means investors will likely favor Hong Kong over Shanghai when Ant is listed in both venues.
But the biggest advantage for Hong Kong remains China’s capital controls.
“Diminishing policy favor from China would be a long-term challenge for HKEX,” said Hong. “Mainland bourses obviously wanted to have a share in the game, but as long as capital controls are in place Hong Kong and the HKEX remained very hard to replace.”

The death in police custody of African-American George Floyd has prompted a groundswell of concern about racism around the world, prompting brands to ditch names seen as derogatory such as Eskimo Pie ice cream and Aunt Jemima pancake mix.
Unilever said in June it would drop the word ""fair"" from its Fair & Lovely skin lightening products.
Romani Rose, head of the German Council of Sinti and Roma, welcomed the move, reported by the Bild am Sonntag newspaper, although he said he was more worried about rising racism, such as shouts of ""gypsy"" or ""Jew"" in soccer stadiums.
""It is good that Knorr is reacting to the complaints of many people,"" he told the newspaper. ""But 'gypsy schnitzel' and 'gypsy sauce' are not the most important things.""
Unilever was not immediately available to comment.

The Nazis subjected Sinti - the name used by ethnic Roma based in Germany for centuries - to forced sterilization under “racial purity” laws and Roma were deported to death camps, where they wore uniforms bearing a “Z” for “Zigeuner”.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - The chairman of  El Al  Israel Airlines (TA:ELAL), Eli Defes, is stepping down immediately because of an undisclosed medical condition, he said on Sunday.
Defes joined El Al's board in 2015 and became chairman in 2017.
It was not immediately clear who would replace Defes, but it would probably be one of two vice chairpeople: Yehuda Levy or Tamar Mozes-Borovitz.
Israel's flag carrier is fighting for survival after the COVID-19 pandemic added to its difficulties, forcing it to suspend flights and furlough most of its employees. It has reported losses for the last two years and racked up debt to renew its fleet.
Last month Eli Rozenberg, a U.S. citizen resident in Israel, offered to funnel $75 million into the airline in return for a 45% stake.
At the same time, El Al is in advanced negotiations for a government bailout to avoid bankruptcy following the pandemic.
The government offered to back $250 million in bank loans in exchange for El Al issuing $150 million in shares, which the state will buy if no-one else does in a public offering.
El Al's board has yet to vote on Rozenberg's offer, which would also need shareholders' approval.

""I have full confidence in the company's management and board members who will know how to lead El Al to beyond this crisis to a more stable and secure future,"" Defes wrote in his resignation letter, a copy of which was seen by Reuters.

1321,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 15, 2020 10:01AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Chegg's Nonstop Growth Drives Sky-High Valuation,"By Christiana Sciaudone
Investing.com -- Try to find a reason to not buy Chegg (NYSE:CHGG). It's a tough one. 
The online textbook, tutoring and skill-accelerating company has delivered sales growth of 25% or more for seven-straight quarters. That number this past quarter was a whopping 63%, showing that Chegg is not just weathering the pandemic but flourishing. As further proof it bumped its guidance for 2020, citing U.S. schools that remain shuttered for the fall semester and skyrocketing international demand. 
Even BMO Capital's Jeff Silber, who has one of the two hold-equivalent ratings on the stock, is optimistic. 
""There is a tremendous amount of growth ahead for them,"" Silber said in a phone interview. ""The valuation is the biggest issue. This stock just keeps going up.""
Silber is an outlier among his peers. Ten of the 12 analysts that cover the stock rate it a buy, according to analysts tracked by Investing.com. That’s despite the fact that Chegg has more than doubled in 2020, and its forward price-to-earnings ratio is currently at about 60. Compare that to Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOGL) 35, Facebook's (NASDAQ:FB) 33 and Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) 34. The company said it doesn't comment on valuation.
While Google, Apple and Facebook have pretty much conquered the world, Chegg still has a ways to go. Case in point, says Chief Business Officer John Fillmore, the total addressable market consists of millions of students worldwide. 
""There is just so much opportunity in the core of what we do,"" Fillmore said in a video interview on Aug. 12. 
Last year, Chegg's sales grew almost 30% in 2019 compared to 2018. And then Covid-19 struck, closing schools and forcing students from kindergarten through college to study from home. At the same time, international demand has exploded, from Turkey to South Korea.""That's been a runaway train for us in terms of continued growth, and we expect that we are really just scratching the surface,"" Fillmore said.
Fillmore cites STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) materials that are already taught in English as an easy entry into countries where English is not the native language. 
""That's a huge tailwind for us in terms of international expansion,"" Fillmore said. Chegg will focus on investing in the international market, including in content translated into local languages. Its foreign students are largely not studying at U.S. institutions. 
""Only 1% of our international customers actually went to school in the US. So these are all new customers to us,"" said Chief Executive Officer Dan Rosensweig on the second quarter earnings call earlier this month. ""So I know there has been some speculation as to whether or not these were international customers that went home and then subscribe at home, but we obviously monitor those things and frankly we are picking up brand-new customers around the world and over 99% of them are brand new to Chegg.""
To be sure, Chegg is not alone in its mission to serve students worldwide. The Santa Clara, California-based company competes against Course Hero, Varsity Tutors, Quizlet and Bartleby, not to mention burgeoning locals that may have an advantage being already versed in their native language and culture.
Fillmore shrugged off the competition, saying that no other company offers the full suite of services that Chegg does. 
""One reason we've seen extraordinary growth is that we are unique,"" Fillmore said.   
One of their main challenges isn’t unique though. Like Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and others, Chegg has an admitted challenge when it comes to the sharing of passwords among students. While it’s improved now that most users have dispersed and returned home, it remains a problem. 
Fillmore admitted that the onus is on the company to continue to work on that issue, and Rosensweig noted that it's a priority for the company. 
""We are implementing systems to address account sharing and investing in device management control,"" Rosensweig said on the earnings call.
The other big area of focus for Chegg is in skills-accelerating via their 2019 purchase of Thinkful, which provides courses in data science, software engineering and digital marketing. Students aren't going to school just for an education, Fillmore said. About 80% of them go to college because they want a job, but the traditional college journey isn't for everyone. Fillmore argues that many end up in jobs that didn't need a college degree to begin, and, of course, graduate swimming in debt.  
Add to that tech giants like Alphabet saying potential employees don't need a four-year degree, and more and more people will pass on a costly and lengthy four-year college education in favor of an efficient course to beef up on necessary skills and get to work.  
""The beautiful thing is unlike the college you may or may not change their curriculum, we can always have the most relevant curriculum for the most in-demand jobs and that's what Thinkful is all about,"" Rosensweig said. ""So we're super excited about the future of Thinkful right now.""

1323,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 15, 2020 07:18AM ET</span>",Day Traders In Brazil Study Would’ve Done Better With 9-to-5 Job,"(Bloomberg) -- Thinking of packing it all in and embarking on a career trading stocks from a commission-free brokerage account? Good luck with that, says recent research.
Academics from Brazil looked at people doing short-term trades in iBovespa contracts and found that of 1,551 retail traders, just 1.1% posted higher average net returns than the Brazilian minimum wage in a bit more than a year. About 0.5% of the traders, who were tracked for 300 sessions, earned more than the average Brazilian bank teller.
The study, which accords with other findings on the inadvisability of market timing, focuses on trading that’s distant in time and place from the Robinhood craze -- futures trading by Brazilian individuals, as opposed to stock picking in America, though its authors say the gist could have wide application. Written by Fernando Chague and Bruno Giovannetti of the Sao Paulo School of Economics and Rodrigo De-Losso of the University of Sao Paulo, the paper said “it is virtually impossible for individuals to day trade for a living.”
Do-it-yourself investing has boomed amid the coronavirus pandemic and, to be sure, many newly minted traders have fared remarkably well -- so far. A  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). portfolio of stocks popular among individuals has soared 78% since March 23’s lows, dusting the S&P 500’s 51% climb. But while gains have come easy in one of the swiftest stock market recoveries on record, Chague says the paper, which tracked traders active in the years from 2013 to 2017, offers reason for skepticism.
“You can get lucky and perform well enough in a few days, but over time it becomes increasingly difficult,” he said. “Most of them, they lost money.”
Day traders are a growing force in equity markets after the coronavirus pandemic left millions at home with little to do. Retail-friendly brokerages have seen record account openings, with no-fee trading apps such as Robinhood making the market more accessible than ever.
While an individual investor may not have as much heft as institutions, they’re showing up in size. Retail traders are now the second-largest cohort in U.S. equity markets, commanding 19.5% of share trading, according to Bloomberg Intelligence data. While market-makers and high-frequency traders still account for the most trading with 43.5%, the retail segment is a larger presence than quantitative investors, hedge funds, traditional long-only participants and bank-affiliated traders.
Traditional money managers are watching the retail trading renaissance with a wary eye. Megacap tech stocks -- a retail fan favorite -- have boosted day-trading portfolios in recent months as investors pile into stay-at-home trades. But over a longer time frame, even above-average professional stock pickers are lucky to get more than 60% of their decisions correct, according to Gradient Investments.
“It makes you a little nervous when you see all this retail money or people that are buying stocks and all of a sudden making 20%, 30%, 40% in a matter of days and weeks and thinking it’s that easy,” Keith Gangl, portfolio manager for Gradient, said by phone. “What ends up happening is more and more people try that and all of a sudden, too many people are trying to do that and it becomes unsuccessful and they end up losing a lot of money.”

1324,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 14, 2020 09:20PM ET</span>",Wall Street Week Ahead: Biden victory? Disputed election? Wall Street prices in November outcomes,"By David Randall and Saqib Iqbal Ahmed
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors are girding their portfolios for market moves ahead of the U.S. presidential vote, as election season kicks into higher gear with the Democratic National Convention in the coming week. 
Though elections have loomed large on investors' radar this year, their influence on markets has taken a backseat to the coronavirus pandemic and unprecedented stimulus from U.S. policymakers. 
That may change in coming weeks, investors said. Some are beefing up cash positions or making bets on a flare-up in volatility as they eye a range of outcomes, including the possibility that the contest between President Donald Trump and presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden may yield a result that is not immediately certain or likely to be disputed. 
""There's plenty of reasons to believe that the election outcome is going to be drawn out,"" said Lamar Villere, a portfolio manager at Villere & Co. ""That's going to show the cracks in a market that's been priced for perfection.""
Villere's firm has raised its cash levels to as high as 20% of assets as a hedge against election-induced volatility in a stock market some say has become richly valued - the S&P 500 has rallied more than 50% from its lows of the year and trades at its highest forward price-to-earnings multiple in around two decades.
Some investors believe the market's performance over the next few months could point to which candidate will triumph in November.
The incumbent president has tended to win the White House when the S&P 500 index has risen in the three months before the election, data from TD Securities going back to 1930 showed. 
That may be bad news for Trump. While the index is up about 3% for this month, August kicks off what has historically been the weakest three-month stretch of the year for equities, where the average historic return stands at about 0%, according to data from BofA Global Research. 
At the same time, no incumbent has been awarded a second term in the midst of a recession, TD securities wrote. 
Biden leads Trump by 8 percentage points, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released Wednesday after Biden had selected U.S. Senator Kamala Harris as his running mate.
A Biden victory - as well as a possible Democratic sweep of the House and Senate - could threaten policies championed by Trump and generally favored by Wall Street, including lower corporate tax rates and fewer regulations, analysts said.
""The full implications of a future Biden presidency could unsettle markets in the first instance,"" analysts at Oxford Economics said in a recent note. 
A proposed corporate tax rate increase to 28% could shave about 5.5% off 2021 S&P 500 earnings, lower capital spending by around $50 billion and lead to a $100 billion decline in stock buybacks, according to J.P.Morgan. 
At the same time, a Biden administration would likely move away from Trump's trade tariffs in Europe and China, helping international and emerging market stocks outperform U.S. equities in the year ahead, said Stuart Katz, chief investment officer of Robertson Stephens Wealth Management.
At least one of Biden's flagship policies - a $2 trillion increase in infrastructure spending - could further weigh on the already weakened U.S. dollar, Oxford Economics said.
A Trump re-election, meanwhile, could allay concerns over higher taxes but spark renewed fears of U.S.-China trade tensions, said Stephen Innes, Chief Global Market Strategist at AxiCorp.
A second term for Trump could also be positive for oil and gas companies which may benefit from a further relaxation of Obama-era regulations, Innes said.
Investors should also prepare for the possibility that the president could cast doubt on the veracity of the vote or pull out of the race altogether, wrote Joseph Amato, CIO of equities at Neuberger Berman, said in a recent note.
Trump escalated fears of a contested election in a late July tweet, suggesting the election be delayed until people can ""properly, securely and safely vote.""

""The further behind he is in the polls, the more provocative his decision-making could become,"" Amato wrote.

1325,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 14, 2020 08:56PM ET</span>","Epic Games wins support from 'Fortnite' gamers, firms on Apple standoff","By Neha Malara and Akanksha Rana
(Reuters) - ""Fortnite"" creator Epic Games found support from its legions of gamers, Tinder-owner Match Group and Spotify for suing Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) after the tech giants dropped the popular video game from their app stores for violating payment guidelines.
Epic Games started a social media campaign against the iPhone maker by releasing a parody of Apple's iconic ""1984"" commercial in its video game, and soon the hashtag ""#FreeFortnite"" was trending on Twitter.
Gamers with hundreds of thousands of YouTube followers took to the video-streaming platform and other social media platforms to share their thoughts on the situation and show their support.
""This is insane, we are watching actual history take place because we just don't see this anymore,"" a YouTuber with the handle ""thatdenverguy"", who has more than a million subscribers, said.
""Tim Sweeney and everybody at Epic, we stand with you and thank you for standing up for something bigger than Fortnite here that helps us out.""
Google declined to comment, while Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Friday.
In a statement on Thursday, Apple said ""Fortnite"" was removed because Epic had launched the payment feature with the ""express intent of violating the App Store guidelines"" after having had apps in the store for a decade.
Developers have long criticized Apple's commissions of between 15% and 30% on many App Store purchases, its prohibitions on courting customers for outside signs-ups, and what some developers see as an opaque and unpredictable app-vetting process.
Facebook (O:FB), which has long been at odds with Apple over privacy issues, seized on the backlash to attack the commissions too. It said Apple had declined a request to waive the fees for the social network's new online events product, framing the decision as a refusal to assist small businesses.
Analysts believe users of Apple devices spend the most on gaming through their purchases on the App Store, which is the largest component of the company's services segment revenue of $46.3 billion per year.
""We are somewhat surprised that Epic is the one that has chosen to mount the challenge as Epic also operates a digital store where they take a cut of third-party sales,"" Evercore analyst Amit Daryanani said.
Apple, Google and Facebook are among major American technology companies that have come under fire for their alleged abuse of market power and just last month their chief executives were grilled by lawmakers in a five-hour long congressional hearing.
Companies, including music streaming service provider  Spotify Technology  SA (N:SPOT) and the owner of Hinge and other dating apps  Match Group Inc  (O:MTCH), issued statements supporting Epic, with Match accusing Apple of using its ""unfair policies to hurt consumers, app developers and entrepreneurs.""
Gene Muster, a managing partner at Loup Ventures, said developer benefits have enabled the App Store to be a trusted source of software and content for nearly 1.4 billion active Apple devices.
""Lowering or eliminating the fee would jeopardize the integrity of the App Store,"" he added.
Launched in 2017, ""Fortnite"" has amassed a huge following among young gamers and its popularity has pushed the valuation of Epic Games to over $17 billion in a funding round earlier this year. The free-to-play battle-royal videogame competes with Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) Ltd's (HK:0700) ""PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds"".

In both Apple's App Store and Google's Play Store, ""Fortnite"" had about 2 million downloads in July 2020, according to mobile analytics firm SensorTower. But Apple users spent about $34 million, while Android users spent only $2 million, according to its data.

1326,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 14, 2020 06:31PM ET</span>","Facebook bashes Apple for refusing to waive commission fees, seizing on backlash","By Katie Paul
(Reuters) -  Facebook Inc  (O:FB) said on Friday that Apple Inc (O:AAPL) had declined its request to waive a 30% commission fee the iPhone maker charges apps listed on iOS devices, taking a shot at its fellow Big Tech peer as developers challenge the policy.
The move is the latest salvo in a long-running cold war between two of the world's most powerful tech companies, which have clashed over their approaches to user privacy as both face regulatory scrutiny over alleged anticompetitive behavior.
Facebook said it requested the waiver so that small businesses would not have to pay Apple's cut for a new paid online events product the world's biggest social media company is launching on its core platform.
Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
On Thursday, Apple removed popular video game ""Fortnite"" from its app store for violating its in-app payment guidelines, sparking a backlash online and prompting developer Epic Games to file a federal antitrust lawsuit challenging Apple's rules.
Apple takes a cut of between 15% and 30% for most app subscriptions and payments made inside apps, though there are some exceptions for companies that already have a credit card on file for iPhone customers if they also offer an in-app payment that would benefit Apple.
Developers have long criticized the commissions, as well as Apple's prohibitions on courting customers for outside sign-ups, and what some developers see as an opaque and unpredictable app-vetting process.
A mock-up of the new events product on iPhone, provided by Facebook, showed that the company planned to tell users that Apple would take 30% of the purchase. 
Google (O:GOOGL) also typically takes a 30% commission for payments within apps on its Android devices, although it was not immediately clear whether it would assess a charge in this case. In its Android mock-up, Facebook noted only that it would not take a fee, without disclosing its arrangement with Google.
Google declined to comment on its fee arrangement for the product, and Facebook did not respond to the request for comment.
Facebook also did not say whether it had tried to make use of Apple's ""multiplatform"" exceptions.
The disclosure is likely to touch a nerve with Apple, whose App Store rules bar developers from discouraging the use of its in-app purchase system. Spotify (NYSE:SPOT) in the past has said Apple rejected its attempts to communicate with users about the fee structures.
Fidji Simo, who heads the core Facebook app, announced the tool in a media conference call featuring small business owners who praised it as a way to reach customers and earn revenue online during the coronavirus pandemic.
She said Facebook considered it ""important to be transparent, when people are supporting small businesses,"" as users might not be aware that part of their payments could be ""going to an almost $2 trillion company.""

Asked if she thought Apple would approve the change, even with language about fees that could discourage users from using the in-app purchase mechanism, she said she expected to find out ""in the next couple days.""

BOSTON (Reuters) - Trian Fund Management said on Friday that it sold stakes in three of its biggest holdings, including Procter & Gamble Company (N:PG) , in the second quarter for portfolio management reasons and to free up cash to make new investments.
The firm held 10.8 million shares in P&G at the end of the second quarter, down 65% from the 31 million shares it owned at the end of the first quarter, according to a regulatory filing.
Trian made the sales in April and May and made them public at the time, assuring investors that it still supports the company's management and will continue to sit on its board.
""The reduction by Trian of its holdings in P&G was primarily the result of sales of shares held by a fund managed by Trian that has a multi-year lockup period that expires this year,"" the firm said, adding that it ""continues to be a large shareholder of P&G.""
P&G's stock price has climbed 19% in the last three months and is up 8.71% since January.
Trian also cut its holdings in Bank of New York Mellon Corp (N:BK) , where it has owned shares for six years, by 54% to 4.4 million shares and reduced its investment in  General Electric  Co. (N:GE) by 7% to 59.3 million shares.

The filing did not show any new investments for the New York-based firm which is known for proposing operational fixes at its portfolio companies, often through white papers. The activist firm presents itself as a partner that can offer constructive advice rather than the corporate raider intent on breaking companies apart.

The report https://www.ft.com/content/ea0f0775-d97e-4aba-9ec9-7da1945f2a1a said that talks for an emergency funding fell through as Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) did not qualify for taxpayer support. It is the luxury car unit of India's  Tata Motors Ltd  (NS:TAMO) and Tata Steel, both owned by Indian conglomerate Tata Group.
The bailout plan, titled ""Project Birch"", had been authorized by Finance Minister Rishi Sunak in May to rescue companies that are seen as strategically important, with the Treasury saying it may step in to support crucial businesses on a ""last resort"" basis after other options run out.
The report, citing a source familiar with the matter, said that the funding scheme became infeasible for Tata as it imposed strict conditions on any lending. 
""Tata Steel remains in ongoing and constructive talks with the UK Government on areas of potential support,"" Tata Steel said in an emailed statement. 

The UK Treasury said it would not comment on individual companies. Tata Motors did not immediately respond to request for comment.

(Reuters) - Warren Buffett's  Berkshire Hathaway Inc  (N:BRKa) said on Friday it has sold shares of some of the largest U.S. banks, slashing its stakes in  Wells Fargo  & Co (N:WFC) and JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) and exiting an investment in  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS).
In a regulatory filing detailing its U.S.-listed investments as of June 30, Berkshire also disclosed a new 20.9 million share investment worth $563.6 million in Toronto-based  Barrick Gold Corp  (TO:ABX), one of the world's largest mining companies.
Investors monitor Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire's quarterly filings to see where Buffett and his portfolio managers Todd Combs and Ted Weschler see value.
Shares of Barrick have benefited from rising gold prices, which set a record last week, and rose 3.2% in after-hours trading following Berkshire's disclosure. Barrick did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Berkshire reduced its Wells Fargo stake by 26% in the quarter to 237.6 million shares.
Since early 2018, Berkshire has shed more than half of its Wells Fargo shares, which were once worth $32 billion but lost value as the bank was hurt by scandals for mistreating customers. Buffett first invested in Wells Fargo in 1989.
Berkshire also reduced by 62% its stake in JPMorgan, where Combs is a director, to 22.2 million shares, and shed its remaining 1.9 million Goldman shares.
Buffett has not given up on the banking industry, after telling investors in May that banks were well-capitalized and capable of weathering the coronavirus pandemic. 
Berkshire still invests in several banks including Bank of America Corp (N:BAC), where in the last month it invested more than $2 billion, giving it an 11.9% stake worth more than $27 billion.
In Friday's filing, Berkshire said it also exited its investment in Toronto-based Restaurant Brands International Inc (TO:QSR), the parent of Burger King and Tim Hortons.

Berkshire also has more than 90 operating units including the Geico car insurer, BNSF railroad and Dairy Queen ice cream.

BOSTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Prominent fund managers dove into technology and consumer stocks during the second quarter, helping fuel a rally that has pushed the benchmark S&P 500 near record highs despite the economic toll of the coronavirus pandemic, regulatory filings released on Friday showed.
Their favorite bets included the so-called FAANG stocks--shares of  Facebook Inc  (O:FB), Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN), Apple Inc (O:AAPL), Netflix Inc (O:AAPL), and Google-parent Alphabet Inc (O:GOOGL)--which have accounted for bulk of the market's gains this year. They also snapped up shares of companies such as Zoom and PayPal, whose growth rates have spiked during the pandemic as millions have worked remotely.
Investors ranging from George Soros' family office, which raised its investment in Amazon.com Inc by 102%, to Dan Sundheim's D1 Capital Partners, which increased its stake in  Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT) by 74%, bet on the powerhouse companies leading the transition to doing nearly everything from home.

Cinctive Capital Management, a hedge fund that employs teams of traders, put on a new position in  Zoom Video Communications  Inc (O:ZM) which is now hosting milestone events like weddings in addition to the more mundane Monday morning office meetings. Its stock price has surged 263% this year.
Online payments giant  PayPal Holdings Inc  (O:PYPL)n, whose stock has gained 79% since January as consumers performed an increasing number of cashless transactions, attracted Senator Investment Group and Carlson Capital among its new investors. Cinctive raised its stake by 26% and Adage Capital Management increased its stake by 17% to 1.5 million shares.
Scott Ferguson's Sachem Head Capital Management established a new position in  Nuance Communications  Inc (O:NUAN), maker of Dragon speech recognition products. Viking Global Investors raised its position in the company.
Regulatory fillings known as 13Fs show what fund managers owned at the end of the second quarter. While they are backward looking, they offer one of the few public disclosures of what prominent funds own at any given time.
Along with the bets on technology, some funds took positions in consumer companies that suffered steep declines in the first quarter.
Viking established new positions in Hilton Worldwide and discount retailer TJX Companies Inc (N:TJX). Moore Capital boosted its position in TJX by 528%. Brahman Capital, meanwhile, established a new position in motorcycle manufacturer Harley-Davidson Inc (N:HOG). Shares of the company are up 42% over the last three months.
While several prominent funds appeared to be betting on a consumer rebound, some added protection against inflation by moving into gold. Mason Capital Partners, Sandell Asset Management and Caxton Associates all initiated new positions on the SPDR Gold Trust (O:GLD), which is up nearly 28% for the year to date.

A deadlock between top Democrats and the White House over more stimulus measures to support the economy has also been a major point of focus.
Uncertainty over the timing of an agreement has undercut sentiment in recent sessions, with the upcoming U.S. presidential elections expected to add another layer of caution.

(Reuters) - The S&P 500 was near flat, hovering below record highs, on Friday as data showed the U.S. economy was still hurting from the COVID-19 pandemic, adding to uncertainty over the recovery.
Aggressive stimulus measures have helped the three main U.S. stock indexes bounce back from a coronavirus-driven crash in March, and the S&P 500 briefly traded above its Feb. 19 record close for a second straight day on Thursday.
But the index has been unable to finish above the record, partly as prospects of more fiscal aid have faded with the Senate and House of Representatives in recess and no fresh talks scheduled.

""I think the market is going to tread water here for a little bit.""

Separately, readings showed that U.S. factory output increased more than expected in July, but remained below pre-pandemic levels while consumer sentiment was largely steady in the first half of August.

(Reuters) - Shares of German biotechnology firm CureVac BV (O:CVAC) soared as much as 222% after their Nasdaq debut on Friday, in the first stock market opening of a company developing a potential vaccine to combat the novel coronavirus.
The stock opened at $44 per share and hit a session high of $51.48 in early trade, compared with the initial public offering (IPO) price of $16 per share.
CureVac Chief Executive Officer Franz-Werner Haas said with the listing, the company now has about a billion euros of cash on hand to develop its vaccine candidate and to expand manufacturing capacity in order to meet global demand. 
""What we've seen so far is very promising, we are very confident."" 
Haas said the company expects to put its vaccine on the market by mid-2021, adding CureVac is in talks with governments around the world for potential purchase agreements. 
He said the company was not in talks with the White House, which on Tuesday announced a $1.5 billion deal with competitor  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) for 100 million doses of its vaccine candidate.
Earlier on Friday, CureVac sold 13.33 million shares at $16 apiece, the top end of its indicated price range of between $14 and $16 per share, raising $213.3 million in the IPO.
""Investors can't get enough COVID vaccine stocks and CureVac's vaccine will likely be favored by the German government,"" said Kathleen Smith, principal at Renaissance Capital, a provider of institutional research and IPO ETFs. 
The company in June started an early-stage coronavirus trial in healthy volunteers, results for which are expected in the final quarter of 2020.

In June, the German government took a 23% stake in CureVac for about $343 million. A month later, GlaxoSmithKline (L:GSK) and the Qatar Investment Authority also bought a stake in the company.

(Reuters) - A federal judge in Detroit on Friday rejected a bid by General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) to reinstate a racketeering lawsuit against its smaller rival Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCA).
GM claimed it had new information on foreign accounts used in an alleged bribery scheme involving FCA and leaders of the United Auto Workers (UAW) union. But U.S. District Judge Paul Borman said GM's ""newly discovered evidence is too speculative to warrant reopening this case.""
GM said it would appeal the ruling.
""Today’s decision is disappointing, as the corruption in this case is proven given the many guilty pleas from the ongoing federal investigation,"" the largest U.S. automaker said in a statement. ""GM’s suit will continue - we will not accept corruption.""
FCA said, ""Judge Borman’s ruling this morning once again confirms what we have said from the beginning -- that GM’s lawsuit is meritless -- and its attempt to submit an amended complaint under the guise of asking the court to change its mind was nothing more than a baseless attempt to smear a competitor that is winning in the marketplace."" 
FCA previously compared GM's filing to a ""third-rate spy movie, full of preposterous allegations."" 
When it first filed its lawsuit last year, GM alleged that FCA bribed UAW officials over many years to corrupt the collective bargaining process and gain advantages, costing GM billions of dollars. GM was seeking ""substantial damages"" that one analyst said could have totaled at least $6 billion.
In July, Borman threw out the racketeering lawsuit, saying GM's alleged injuries were not caused by FCA's alleged violations.
FCA said that as it operates facilities in Italy and more than 40 other countries, the existence of foreign bank accounts is ""unremarkable, and certainly not illegal.""

FCA is due to merge with France's PSA by the first quarter of 2021.

Investing.com -- Initial public offerings keep surprising.
 Curevac Bv  (NASDAQ:CVAC), a German biopharmaceutical company working on a coronavirus vaccine, opened Friday at $44 after pricing at $16. Meanwhile, fintech insurer  Duck Creek Technologies Inc  (NASDAQ:DCT) opened at $42 after pricing at $27.
They are the latest companies to blast through pricing in their first day of trading. Last month, insurance start-up  Lemonade Inc  (NYSE:LMND) saw shares jump as much as 144% upon going public. Also in July,  Bigcommerce Holdings Inc  (NASDAQ:BIGC) rose 292% on its opening.
Trying to price an IPO isn't easy, Santosh Rao, head of research at Manhattan Venture Partners, told Marketplace last year. “Pricing, in general, at a very high level, is more an art than science,” said Rao.
CureVac has been backed by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation in the past. It is focused on using messenger RNA to treat diseases. The company raised more than $213 million in its IPO.
Duck Creek's $405 million IPO was oversubscribed, according to IPO Boutique. The company provides a software-as-a-service platform, or SaaS, for the property and casualty insurance industry.
Among its 150 customers are Progressive (NYSE:PGR), Liberty Mutual, AIG (NYSE:AIG) and Geico.

BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Argentina might extend the deadline for its proposed bond restructuring beyond Aug. 24 and submit its amended offer to the U.S. securities regulator next week, a source with direct knowledge of the situation told Reuters.
Bondholders will have 10 days to decide on the offer after it is submitted. The current deadline for accepting the deal is Aug. 24. That schedule implied the government would issue a decree formalizing the offer and file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Friday.
""The decree is going well but might not be finalized today. The next working day is Tuesday. The 10 day period will be met and in no case will the extension of the offer period go beyond August,"" said the source, who is familiar with the government's thinking and asked not to be named as the process is confidential.
Under that scenario, the last day for filing the offer would be Aug. 21. The economy ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 
Argentina and its main creditor groups reached an agreement in principle on Aug. 4 to restructure about $65 billion in distressed sovereign bonds after months of talks, breaking an impasse over the terms of the deal that had threatened to derail the negotiation.
With an already weak economy further punished by the coronavirus, the government wants to avoid the kind of messy sovereign bond default that punctuated a crisis in 2001 that tossed millions of middle class Argentines into poverty.

After the bond revamp is done, Argentina will start talks with the International Monetary Fund toward a new program to replace a defunct $57 billion standby lending deal negotiated by the previous administration two years ago.

1348,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 14, 2020 12:20PM ET</span>",Vaccine makers including Moderna must hit U.S. timing goals for full payments,"By Carl O'Donnell
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The United States is tying payments for COVID-19 vaccines to timing milestones for production and approval, according to public documents and a Trump administration official, putting pressure on drugmakers including  Moderna  Inc (O:MRNA) to meet ambitious targets.
In a deal with Moderna announced this week, federal agencies negotiated a sliding scale of payments. The Cambridge, Massachusetts, biotech's $1.5-billion deal pays out in full if its vaccine receives regulatory clearance by January 31, 2021, according to filings. It receives $1.2 billion, if it falls short of that timing goal. 
Moderna also receives $600 million when it can demonstrate it has built out industrial-scale manufacturing capabilities for its vaccine, even if that happens before the drug is authorized by regulators, the filings show. 
U.S. government payments to other drugmakers are also conditional on launching clinical trials no later than early fall and building out manufacturing capabilities by the end of the year, two senior administration officials told Reuters, adding that terms varied by company. 
The deal terms add financial risk for the drugmakers and increase pressure for speed that has worried some public health advocates. HHS and Moderna declined comment; other drugmakers had no immediate comment on Friday. 
Other drugmakers did not publicly reveal details on the specific terms of their agreements with the U.S. government, though  Pfizer  has said its deal with the government for its joint vaccine with BioNTech only pays out if it receives regulatory approval. 
The United States has allocation agreements with Johnson & Johnson (N:JNJ), Pfizer Inc (N:PFE), BioNTech SE (F:22UAy),  Sanofi  (NASDAQ:SNY) SA, and GlaxoSmithKline Plc (L:GSK). It also has a claim on 300 million doses of AstraZeneca (NYSE:AZN) Plc's vaccine in exchange for helping finance its research and development efforts. 
Analysts already have said drugmakers may struggle to recoup billions invested in vaccine development at U.S. treatment prices that so far range from $20 to $42 per person.
Administration officials have said they expect the U.S. governments' Operation Warp Speed vaccine development program to deliver an inoculation by the end of the year. President Donald Trump has said he thinks a vaccine could be available before the November 3 presidential election. 
To obtain regulatory approval, a vaccine must reduce incidents of infection with the novel coronavirus by 50 percent compared to people who are not inoculated and demonstrate a high level of safety. 
Experts say ongoing vaccine trials, which must enroll tens of thousands of people and wait for them to be exposed to the coronavirus, could produce usable results soon or as late as mid-2021, raising questions about drugmakers' ability to meet the administration's timelines.
Shares of Moderna have more than tripled since it announced in January it was developing a vaccine. Moderna has never produced an approved vaccine. 
But the implied U.S. government payment per course of treatment for Moderna's drug, $30.50, could decline to $24.50 if it doesn't receive approval of its vaccine by January 31, 2021.
The United States, through its Operation Warp Speed vaccine development program, has set aside around $8 billion to lock in deals for COVID-19 vaccines in advance of any of them receiving approval from regulators.

1350,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 14, 2020 11:45AM ET</span>",America’s Favorite Pizza Topping Is Starting to Get Scarce,"(Bloomberg) -- Pepperoni, America’s most beloved pizza topping, is getting ever-more expensive to obtain amid production snags at meat plants and high demand for pizza.
Small pizza shops across the U.S. are reporting higher prices and tight supply for their usual pepperoni orders. At Charlie’s Pizza House in Yankton, South Dakota, manager Nick Johnson has seen prices steadily increase from $2.87 a pound in January 2019 to $4.12 now. At New York City’s Emily, chef and co-owner Matthew Hyland is paying $6 a pound, up from $4 earlier this year.
Meanwhile, Brandon King, who owns R-Pizza in Vermillion, South Dakota, said availability issues forced him to change pepperoni brands for the first time in his nearly nine years running the parlor.
Earlier in the pandemic, restaurants experienced high prices and shortages for other meat toppings, like ground beef. But while beef’s spike appears to be easing, pepperoni prices have remained high.
Barry Friends, a partner at foodservice consultant Pentallect, said the ingredient’s labor-intensive process and low profit margins have made some producers say “screw it” as they streamline operations amid the coronavirus.
Pork processors “are basically just shipping out large pieces of meat for further processing,” Friends said. “They’re not doing as much because they don’t have the people to do the work.”
It’s not just a supply issue -- demand is also up. Pizza restaurants have shown resiliency throughout the pandemic as homebound consumers turned to the original delivery staple for comfort food. Domino’s Pizza Inc. said the shift to more takeout and delivery offered a “tailwind,” and Papa John’s International Inc. reported record North American same-store sales in its latest quarterly earnings.
Larger chains are insulated from pricier pepperoni, since they typically buy ingredients on long-term contracts where prices are pre-negotiated and not subject to market changes. Domino’s, Papa John’s, Pizza Hut and Little Caesars (NASDAQ:CZR) haven’t experienced shortages or price increases.
For now, restaurants aren’t increasing their prices. At Charlie’s Pizza House, Johnson said his customers immediately notice if there’s a price increase on the menu or a change in the pepperoni so he’ll keep paying the higher charge. Hyland, Emily’s owner, agreed.
“It’s an American right to have pepperoni on pizza,” Hyland said. “Pepperoni is such a huge part of pizza it’s important to us that we keep it accessible.”

Dillard's (NYSE:DDS) rallied 15% after it lost way than analysts expected, reporting a loss per share of 37 cents compared to the forecast loss of $4.79. 
Peers Macy's (NYSE:M), Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN) and  Kohls Corp  (NYSE:KSS) also rose on hopes things aren't as bad as they seem, despite U.S. retail sales that rose less than expected in July and an elusive deal on fiscal stimulus. Macy's shares rose  7.6%, while Nordstrom  rose 5.4%, and Kohls  rose 5.3%.
""During the quarter, we worked hard to control inventory and expenses. These measures allowed us to improve gross margin and substantially narrow the loss from the prior year second quarter,"" Chief Executive Officer William T. Dillard, II, said in a statement. ""We will maintain this conservative financial approach as we move forward.”
All Dillard's locations were reopened by June 2, and remain so largely with reduced hours. Sales performance in the stores since reopening through August 1 was approximately 72% of prior year sales on corresponding days.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Walmart's (N:WMT) e-commerce platform Flipkart has partnered with a startup backed by spirits giant  Diageo  to deliver alcohol in two Indian states, according to government letters seen by Reuters, months after Amazon (O:AMZN) planned a similar foray.
Flipkart and Amazon's interest in delivering alcohol in India marks a bold move to make inroads into an alcohol market that is worth $27.2 billion, according to estimates by IWSR Drinks Market Analysis.
The local governments of eastern West Bengal and Odisha states have said that Flipkart can be associated as a technology service provider of Diageo (L:DGE)-backed HipBar, an Indian alcohol home delivery mobile application.
Flipkart's customers will be allowed to access HipBar's application on the e-commerce giant's platforms, according to the letters, which have not previously been reported.
Under the arrangement, Flipkart customers will be able to place orders for their favourite tipple, which HipBar will then deliver after collecting products from retail outlets, according to a person with direct knowledge of the matter.
HipBar, 26% owned by Diageo India, and Flipkart did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
In June, Reuters reported that Amazon had secured clearance to deliver alcohol in West Bengal, signalling the U.S. e-commerce giant's foray into the sector.
""Flipkart wants to make sure that whatever consumers want, they get it. The margins (on liquor deliveries) maybe low, but for Flipkart it is about stickiness so consumer don't have to anywhere else,"" said a source close to Flipkart.
West Bengal is India's fourth most populous state, with a population of more than 90 million people, while Odisha's population is more than 41 million. Some states in India, like Gujarat in the west, prohibit alcohol retail.
India's top two food-delivery startups, Swiggy and Zomato, have also started delivering alcohol in some cities, as companies look to cash in on the high demand for booze from people staying at home due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Amazon on Friday also said it will launch an online pharmacy in India that will serve the southern city of Bengaluru.
Shoppers in India are increasingly going online to buy everything from groceries to electronics during the pandemic.

1354,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 14, 2020 09:45AM ET</span>",U.S. Industrial Production Increased in July for a Third Month,"(Bloomberg) -- U.S. industrial production increased for a third straight month in July, indicating manufacturing is gradually emerging from a deep demand slump tied to the coronavirus pandemic.
Total output at factories, mines and utilities rose 3% from the prior month after a revised 5.7% gain in June that was the biggest since 1959, Federal Reserve data showed Friday. The July increase matched the median projection in a Bloomberg survey of economists. Factory output climbed 3.4% last month, while manufacturing capacity utilization increased to 69.2%.
Despite another solid advance in production, the Fed’s index of industrial output is still down 8.3% from February, before the pandemic prompted lockdowns of businesses and sent the economy into a tailspin. The report also showed plenty of spare capacity as the utilization rate remains well below the 75% that prevailed before the virus took hold.
Excess capacity weighs on corporate profits because capital is underutilized and it also signals business investment in new equipment will remain depressed and weigh on economic growth. Total capacity utilization, including factories, mines and utilities, improved to 70.6% from a revised 68.5%. The latest plant-use rate is well below the 76.9% seen in February.
Most major industries reported an increase in factory output last month. Production of motor vehicles and parts led the gain with a 28.3% advance. Excluding auto production, factory output climbed 1.6% after larger gains the prior two months.
The Fed’s report showed utility output increased 3.3%, while mining rose 0.8%, the first advance since January. Oil and gas well drilling fell another 8% after an 18% drop a month earlier. Drilling has plummeted 71.5% from a year earlier after a slump in oil prices month ago prompted exploration and production companies to slash projects.

The Dow Jones Industrial Averageand S&P 500 dipped at the opening of trading in the U.S., while the NASDAQ Compositewas flat. The S&P has been headed toward a new record in recent sessions, which if achieved would be the fastest recovery from a 30% drop earlier this year after businesses shut down to stop the spread of Covid-19.
On Friday, new data showed domestic retail sales growth slowed more than expected in July, adding to worries about a wobbly post-pandemic economic recovery in the absence of a new U.S. fiscal stimulus bill.
Aggressive stimulus measures have helped Wall Street's main indexes bounce from a coronavirus-driven crash in March, and the S&P 500 briefly traded above its Feb. 19 record close for a second straight day on Thursday.

TOKYO (Reuters) - A major investor in Japan's Toshiba Corp (T:6502) has called for a third-party investigation into the conglomerate's annual shareholder meeting, saying its vote was not fully recognized in a potential breach of governance.
The demand from Singapore-based 3D Investment Partners is likely to sharpen scrutiny of the treatment of Toshiba's foreign investors. It follows a contentious, but failed, attempt by foreign shareholders to elect some new independent directors to Toshiba's board at the July 31 meeting.
3D said voting rights representing a 1.1% stake in Toshiba were not reflected in the results of the meeting, according to an Aug. 9 letter from the hedge fund to Toshiba's outside directors seen by Reuters. 
The fund, which holds a 4.2% voting stake and ranks among Toshiba's top five shareholders, had nominated two candidates as independent directors and publicly said it would vote against Chief Executive Nobuaki Kurumatani.
""Such administration of shareholders meetings by Toshiba (including the manner of processing voting forms) was at least improper and was questionable from the viewpoint of corporate governance,"" 3D said in the letter.
3D said it was told one of its voting forms did not reach the Tokyo office of Sumitomo Mitsui (NYSE:SMFG) Trust Bank (T:8309), Toshiba's designated administrator, until July 31, which was after the voting deadline. 
Yet the form had been mailed from a post office in Tokyo on July 27, meaning the delivery time should have been just one day, 3D said, citing the post office's website.
Another voting form mailed from the same post office on July 28 reached Sumitomo Mitsui Trust a day later, and was in time for the meeting, 3D said. 
""We don't comment on communications with specific investors, but vote counting was done by our shareholder registry administrator and we are conducting investigations with the administrator,"" Toshiba said in a statement.
""At the moment we've been told that counting process was done properly.""
A spokesman for Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank said it could not comment on specific cases.
SHAREHOLDER SCRUTINY
The incident is likely to raise fresh questions about the relationship between foreign investors, who make up 60% of Toshiba's shareholders, and the company.
Reuters previously reported the Japanese government delayed approval until the last minute for another Singapore-based fund to vote at the same meeting.
Toshiba CEO Kurumatani held on to his job, but a breakdown of voting results from the meeting showed a precipitous slide in support to just 58% from 99% a year earlier - a rare rebuke of a Japan Inc chief executive.
3D's 1.1% vote, even if counted, would not have changed the outcome. But the fund said it was ""strongly concerned that many other shareholders might have been hindered in exercising their voting rights"".
It asked for a third-party investigation into whether shareholders' voting rights had been processed properly. 
The fund said it would consider starting proceedings to force Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank to disclose evidence and provide information to the Tokyo Stock Exchange if Toshiba did not ""properly respond"" to its request.

Toshiba has been under pressure from foreign hedge funds since it sold 600 billion yen ($5.6 billion) of stock to dozens of such funds during a crisis stemming from the bankruptcy of its U.S. nuclear power unit in 2017.

1360,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 14, 2020 07:27AM ET</span>",Dubai Is Poised to Gain From Travel Opening With Israel,"(Bloomberg) -- Dubai is likely to benefit the most in aviation from the United Arab Emirates’ historic deal to normalize relations with Israel, gaining a new stream of travelers that can help the Gulf travel hub bounce back from the coronavirus crisis that has decimated air traffic.
The agreement announced Thursday sets aside decades of enmity between the UAE and Israel, opening ties through air travel, tourism, investment, security and telecommunications. Delegations from the two countries are set to meet soon to work out the details.
The opening will give the UAE’s biggest carriers -- Emirates and Etihad -- an opportunity to feed Israeli passengers through their airport hubs in Dubai and Abu Dhabi, respectively, connecting to destinations farther east and west. Currently, Royal Jordanian and Turkish Airlines are the only carriers in the Middle East that fly to Israel.
Dubai in particular could benefit, as its airport offers daily flights to more than 250 destinations, said Anne Correa, vice president for airline and airport services at aviation consulting firm Morten Beyer & Agnew.
Traffic at Dubai International Airport collapsed during the peak of the coronavirus pandemic. The airport recorded the same amount of traffic for the entire month of May that it would normally see in about four hours.
Emirates, the world’s largest long-haul airline, was especially hit because its business model is built around the biggest category of jets -- 115 Airbus SE (OTC:EADSY) A380s and 155 Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co. 777 - carrying passengers between all corners of the globe.
Dubai’s gains could prove to be a setback for Turkish Airlines, “as they have traditionally provided those profitable connections for travelers coming from Israel through their hub in Istanbul,” Correa said.
While Israel and the U.S. expect other Arab nations to follow suit, until then the majority of regional airspace remains closed to Israeli-registered aircraft. “At this point, it would make more sense that UAE-Israel flights would be operated by a UAE-domiciled carrier,” said Correa.
The opening of Saudi Arabian skies would be particularly crucial for Israeli airlines, given its large land mass in the center of the region, where conflicts often force planes to reroute.
Israeli flag carrier El Al was grounded because of the coronavirus, and recently extended its hiatus through the end of August while it tries to arrange a financing plan.
When operating, its planes have had to run a dogleg route to Mumbai, for example, down the Red Sea and up the Gulf of Aden to avoid Saudi airspace. That adds two hours to the trip from Tel Aviv and puts the Israeli carrier at a huge disadvantage to Air India, which can fly the route direct."
1361,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 14, 2020 07:13AM ET</span>",Stocks - US Futures Largely Lower; Dow Futures Down 122 Pts,"By Peter Nurse   
Investing.com - U.S. stocks are set to open largely lower Friday, with investors fretting about the likelihood of additional stimulus as policymakers head home for their summer recess.
At 07:15 AM ET (1100 GMT), US 500 Futures traded 27 points, or 0.2%, lower, the Dow Futures contract fell 122 points, or 0.4%, while Nasdaq 100 Futures gained 10 points, or 0.1%. That said, all three cash indexes are still on course for a positive week.
“We are miles apart in our values,” Nancy Pelosi, the House speaker and leading Democrat, said Thursday at her weekly press conference in Washington, talking about negotiations over the size and scope of the next stimulus bill.
Across the Capitol, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican, officially sent senators home for a three-week summer recess.
This all suggests that the U.S. economy will not see a new package before September, drawing dangerously close to the period when the two parties hold their respective presidential nominating conventions, leading into November’s national election. 
Meanwhile, the head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned earlier this week that the U.S. should be bracing for “the worst fall, from a public health perspective, we’ve ever had.”
“We’re going to have Covid in the fall, and we’re going to have flu in the fall. And either one of those by themselves can stress certain hospital systems,” CDC director Robert Redfield said, noting many hospitals have already been overwhelmed by the number of coronavirus patients.
In Europe, the U.K. imposed a two-week quarantine on people arriving from France and the Netherlands, in response to recent sharp increases in the rate of new coronavirus infections in those countries.
The main U.S. economic data release Friday is the July retail sales number, due at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT),  which is expected to have increased 1.9% in July, a clear slowdown from the sharp gains in May and June. 
Elsewhere, earnings releases are due from the likes of DraftKings (NASDAQ:DKNG) and Madison Square Garden Sports (NYSE:MSGS), but most eyes are likely to be on the legal battle between ‘Fortnite’ maker Epic Games and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) over what the publisher sees as abusively high commissions taken for processing in-app purchases.
Oil prices edged lower Friday, weighed as the latest Covid-19 developments in Europe pointed to a fresh hit to fuel demand.
The OPEC+ producer bloc, which also includes Russia, will meet next week in the form of its Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee to discuss production levels.
U.S. crude futures traded 0.2% lower at $42.16 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract fell 0.2% to $44.89. 
Elsewhere, gold futures dropped 0.9% to $1,952.60/oz, settling into a lower range after registering all-time highs above $2,000. EUR/USD traded 0.1% lower at 1.1808.

The paper said an EU delegation communicated a diplomatic position, supported by 24 the bloc's 27 members, to the U.S. State Department on Aug. 12 in a video call.
Contacted by Reuters, the European Commission had no immediate comment.
In an emailed statement, the U.S. embassy in Berlin said it preferred not to use sanctions and favored cooperation with Europe, but Russia's dominance in Europe's gas markets had left it with no choice.
""The United States must act to address the threat to our national security and foreign policy interests,"" it said.
Die Welt said diplomatic sources confirmed the call took place and that the written version of the EU's demarche, or approach, had been circulated.
""We are highly concerned about the increasing use of sanctions by the U.S. against European companies and interests,"" the paper quoted the note as saying. 
""The EU considers the extraterritorial use of sanctions as a breach of international law,"" it said, adding the European companies involved were pursuing legitimate business activities.
The United States has tightened sanctions on the pipeline, designed and led by Russia's Gazprom (MM:GAZP) and due to start operating in early 2021 to carry gas directly to Germany from Russia.
Five western partners in the 9.5 billion euros ($11.2 billion) project who committed to sharing 50% of the finance and have committed sizeable funds say the gas is needed.
The diplomatic note said the EU shared foreign and security policy goals with the United States and is open to dialogue.

The Nord Stream 2 consortium, based in Switzerland, has knowledge of the EU's initiative, but would not comment, a spokesman for the group said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The owner of money-losing shared office provider WeWork told employees on Thursday it has slashed its cash burn rate almost in half from the end of last year and obtained a $1.1 billion commitment in new financing from majority owner SoftBank Group Corp.
The company said in an e-mail to employees that its second-quarter results show the coronavirus pandemic has hurt business but its financial position remains strong. 
""Our early efforts to become a more streamlined, cash-conscious organization puts us in a better position to adapt quickly, navigate new realities and deliver our future business objectives,"" said Kimberly Ross, chief financial officer of WeWork, in the e-mail seen by Reuters.
Revenue in the quarter reached $882 million, a 9% increase from a year earlier, Ross said. WeWork in the first quarter reported revenue of $1.1 billion, the first time it had exceeded nine figures, and its cash burn was $482 million.
WeWork has $4.1 billion in cash and unfunded cash commitments, including the $1.1 billion in new financing, Ross said. WeWork in July indicated it expected to be cash flow positive in 2021, according to the Financial Times.
The $1.1 billion is the last of the debt facilities included in a wide-ranging transaction announced in October 2019, a source at SoftBank said.
WeWork ended the quarter with 612,000 members, a decline from 693,000 in the prior quarter. But 48% were from prized ""Enterprise"" customers, businesses with 500 employees or more. 
The results were released almost a year to the day after it filed plans to go public, when the company was valued at $47 billion and looked poised to be one of the year's hottest IPOs.

WeWork soon entered a tailspin as revelations of corporate mismanagement emerged. The company has since undergone an enormous management shake-up and remains enmeshed in lawsuits over a $3 billion tender offer to existing shareholders.

1365,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 14, 2020 05:47AM ET</span>","StockBeat: Belarus, Quarantine Measures Send Europe Tumbling","By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- Europe’s stock markets fell sharply on Friday as the U.K.’s decision to impose a 14-day quarantine on travelers returning from France and the Netherlands underlined the risks of a second wave of Covid-19 infections across the continent.
Together with political instability in Belarus that has prompted speculation about possible Russian intervention, and the confirmation of a record 12.1% drop in eurozone GDP for the second quarter, the news is ensuring that the week ends on a sour note.
By 7:45 AM ET (0945 GMT), the benchmark Stoxx 600 was down 1.7% at 366.34, on course to wipe out all its gains for the week.  Tellingly, the worst affected among national stock markets was Poland’s.
Poland’s benchmark index fell 2.8% after Svetlana Tikhanouskaya, who was forced into exile by Belarusian security services after claiming victory in last weekend’s presidential election, appealed to local authorities across the country to sign a petition supporting her claims of ballot fraud.
Earlier Friday, Margarita Simonyan, editor-in-chief of controversial Russian TV channel RT, had tweeted that the time was ripe for “some polite people to restore order”, in a deliberate echo of the phrase that Russian President Vladimir Putin had used to describe the troops he sent to Ukraine in 2014.
A rerun of what happened in Ukraine in 2014 is the last thing markets need right now, when the threat of a generalized second wave of Covid-19 cases across Europe appears to be rising.  
The U.K. decided late on Thursday to require all travelers returning from France, the Netherlands and a handful of smaller states with rising infection numbers to quarantine on their return. There are around 500,000 Brits currently on vacation in France, according to The Times. The news ensured that the FTSE 100 and CAC 40 both lost over 2% by mid-morning in London, with travel names hit hardest.
EasyJet (LON:EZJ) stock, Dart Group (LON:DTG) stock and IAG (LON:ICAG) stock all fell by more than 6%, while Air France KLM (OTC:AFLYY) stock fell 4.9% and hotel operator  Accor 's (PA:ACCP) stock fell 3.1%.
The news was compounded by France’s junior European affairs minister Clement Beaune tweeting that France would “reciprocate”, suggesting that Paris saw the move as a diplomatic affront rather than a public health measure. 
France has seen its numbers of new cases more than double in two weeks, leading Prime Minister Jean Castex to say that the country was “going the wrong way”. German health officials have expressed similar fears about their own case numbers, while the Netherlands, too, has seen a sharp rise in cases. While outbreaks have generally been localized, one has been in the tourist hotspot of Amsterdam – a factor that goes some way to explaining the U.K.’s extending the quarantine requirement to travelers returning from there.
Whether Britons will observe a fresh quarantine imposed by a Prime Minister whose chief adviser notoriously flouted the last lockdown in March is another question - and one without any reassuring answers for U.K. stocks."

LONDON/TOKYO (Reuters) - Global shares dipped on Friday after lacklustre Chinese economic data and worries about a delay in U.S. fiscal stimulus discouraged some investors from taking on risk.
European shares were also dragged lower by a hit to travel stocks after Britain added more European countries to its quarantine list.
The pan-European STOXX 600 was down 0.7%, although on track to gain for a second straight week.
MSCI's world index was 0.2% lower, drifting further from all-time highs touched in February. The index has still rallied close to 50% from March's trough in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.
""The rally was over-extended and most of the good news is already priced in,"" said Francois Savary, chief investment officer at Swiss wealth manager Prime Partners.
""There are no more positive than expected earnings and we're back to the macro background and the checking of the data regularly to see if the recovery is sustainable. Markets are pricing a lot of good news and we will be entering a period of volatility with the U.S. elections coming up.""
Preliminary European employment and GDP numbers due at 0900 GMT and U.S. retail sales figures at 1230 GMT will be watched for signs of divergence between the U.S. and European recoveries.
Data showing a slower-than-expected rise in Chinese industrial production and a surprise fall in retail sales put Asian shares on the backfoot.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 0.1%, although shares in Japan rose 0.2%.
Chinese shares rose 1.5% in choppy trade, with the data suggesting domestic demand is still struggling after the coronavirus outbreak.
E-mini futures for the S&P 500 were flat.
The benchmark German 10-year Bund yield fell to -0.42% after rising for three sessions and having touched a six-week peak in early trade.
Yields on U.S. Treasuries remained elevated after an auction of 30-year bonds on Thursday met weak demand.
Further equity gains are likely to be limited as investors await progress in negotiations over U.S. economic stimulus, which is necessary to prevent a nascent recovery in the world's largest economy from sliding into reverse.
Some traders stuck to the sidelines before a meeting between U.S. and Chinese officials about their Phase 1 trade deal on Saturday.
Spot gold fell 0.35 to $1,947.43 as high U.S. Treasury yields prompted investors to reassess their positions. Bullion has declined more than 4% so far this week, its biggest weekly percentage fall since early March.
Data on Thursday showed the number of Americans seeking unemployment benefits dropped below one million for the first time since the start of the pandemic, but was not enough to change economists' views that the jobs market is faltering.
U.S. Treasury yields also supported the U.S. dollar, which held steady at 106.90 yen and $1.1812 against the euro.
The dollar index was headed for an eighth consecutive week of losses, its longest weekly losing streak since June 2010.

Oil edged further below $45 a barrel amid worries about supply recovery and rising supply. Brent crude fell or 0.7% to $44.67, reversing this week's gains. U.S. West Texas Intermediate slipped 0.6% to $41.99. [O/R]

It also added the Netherlands, Malta and three other countries to the list.
France, the second-most popular overseas destination after Spain for Britons, warned that it would reciprocate. Paris-listed shares (FCHI) fell 2.0%, with Air France KLM (PA:AIRF) dropping 5.9%.
""What we have got is a significant amount of uncertainty over the evolution of coronavirus pandemic, which is maintaining a risk premium for the transportation, leisure and hospitality sectors,"" said Alastair George, head strategist at Edison Investment Research.
Global markets were sluggish as China's retail sales showed a surprise drop in July, while the factory sector's recovery struggled to pick up pace, dimming prospects of a speedy rebound from the coronavirus crisis.
Official data, due for release at 0900 GMT, is likely to confirm that euro zone economy suffered its deepest contraction on record in the second quarter. 
Meanwhile, senior officials from China and the United States will hold a video conference on Saturday to review their Phase 1 trade deal signed in January, amid souring diplomatic relations between the two countries.
Investors also await progress in negotiations over U.S. economic stimulus, a factor that has helped push U.S. stocks to near all-time highs.
Despite Friday's pullback, European stocks are on course for their second straight week of gains on optimism over the development of a COVID-19 vaccine and more stimulus for ailing global economies.

(Reuters) - Alphabet Inc's (O:GOOGL) Google said on Friday it would no longer provide data in response to requests from Hong Kong authorities following the enactment of a new national security law imposed by China.
The U.S. tech giant had not produced any data since the sweeping new law took force in June and would not directly respond to such requests henceforth, it added.
""As always, authorities outside the U.S. may seek data needed for criminal investigations through diplomatic procedures,"" Google said in an emailed statement.
Google reviewed all requests for user data and pushed back on ""overly broad ones"" to protect the privacy of users, it added. 
The Washington Post newspaper reported earlier on Friday that Google would stop responding directly to data requests from Hong Kong authorities, implying the company would now treat Hong Kong effectively the same as mainland China in such dealings.
The national security law has drawn criticism from the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump and further raised U.S.-China tensions after Washington's decision to end the former British colony's special status under U.S. law.
Google notified Hong Kong police on Thursday that it would direct officials to pursue any requests for data through a Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty with the United States, which involves routing through the U.S. Justice Department, the Washington Post reported.
In July,  Facebook Inc  (O:FB), Google and  Twitter Inc  (N:TWTR) suspended processing government requests for user data in Hong Kong.

At 4 AM ET (0800 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 1% lower, the CAC 40 in France fell 1.5% and the U.K.'s FTSE index was down 1.6%.
The United Kingdom decided to impose a 14-day quarantine on arrivals from France, beginning Saturday, and added the Netherlands, Malta and three other countries to the list.

Elsewhere,  Daimler  stock (DE:DAIGn) dropped 1.1% after the maker of Mercedes-Benz cars said it was going to take a hit of nearly $3 billion to settle civil investigations by U.S. regulators and lawsuits from the long-running probe into software to cheat diesel emissions tests.
Earlier Friday, data showed China’s economic recovery continued in July, although not as robustly as many had hoped from the globe’s second largest economy and one of the most important growth drivers.
Industrial output rose 4.8% in July from a year earlier, below the median estimate of 5.2%, while retail sales were still in negative territory after the year-on-year decline slowed to 1.1%.
The euro zone's preliminary GDP numbers for the second quarter are due late in Friday’s session, and the market consensus suggests a drop of 12% compared with the first quarter and 15% compared with the same quarter last year.

1372,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 14, 2020 03:27AM ET</span>","Markets Look Past China, Australia Economic Data Warped by Virus","(Bloomberg) -- Investors continued to shrug at economic data surprises this week in markets including in Australia and China amid distortions caused by the pandemic.
Markets are seemingly inured to occasionally eye-popping gyrations in everything from economic growth to jobs to retail sales data, in the wake of months of social distancing and periodic lockdowns.
The Shanghai Shenzhen CSI 300 -- China’s equity benchmark -- drifted briefly lower before rebounding back to a gain of 0.8% by the afternoon, while the yuan was little-changed Friday, after data showed a less-than-expected 4.8% growth in industrial output in July, and an unexpected 1.1% contraction in retail sales.
On Thursday, the Australian dollar rose 0.1% against the greenback while the S&P/ASX 200 dropped 0.7% despite a strong July jobs report. The data showed employment increasing by 114,700 versus expectations of 30,000, and that the unemployment rate was lower than expected at 7.5%.
Strategists are also digging under the hood of recent reports such U.S. jobless claims and inflation data, warning that headline numbers may not give the whole picture. For instance, John Mauldin, president at investment advisory firm Mauldin Solutions LLC, has previously said that Covid-19 wrought “havoc” on employment data.
The data fog makes it even harder to gauge the outlook for markets, after a rally in asset classes such as stocks, gold, bonds -- even Bitcoin -- from March’s pandemic-induced lows.

The Southeast Asian country has been seeking to speed up its privatisation of state-owned firms in recent years to improve their performance and to fill its coffers amid high levels of public debt.
""One of the reasons behind the stagnation of privatisation progress is the COVID-19 outbreak that has impacted all socio-economic aspects, market demand and the stock market,"" the ministry said in a statement on its website.
The ministry also cited other obstacles including incompetent management at SOEs and the difficulty in evaluating the assets of the companies. 
SOEs that had been targeted for initial public offerings but had yet to be evaluated include mobile carrier MobiFone, the country's largest bank by assets, Agribank, Northern Food Corp., mining group Vinacomin and Vietnam National Chemical Group, it said. 
Vietnam has reported more than 900 COVID-19 infections since its first cases were detected in January, with 21 deaths. The country's gross domestic product grew 0.36% in the second quarter this year, the slowest pace in decades.

The implied level of the S&P 500 could be above 3,600, strategists Dominic Wilson and Vickie Chang wrote in a note Thursday. That’s if markets move toward Goldman’s “comparatively more optimistic” U.S. growth forecast, and real yields move higher but then further optimism pushes breakeven inflation rates higher without sending nominal yields up significantly, bringing the real yields down, they said. The gauge closed at 3,373.43 on Thursday.
“There is still room for market pricing of U.S. growth views to move higher, particularly given improving prospects for an early vaccine,” the note said. “While a back-up in real yields would be a potential drag on equity returns, as long as it is driven by an upgrade to the market’s cyclical views, the improved cyclical outlook would dominate the effect of rising real yields and drive equities higher.”
The S&P 500 has risen 51% off its March 23 low as governments and central banks pumped liquidity into economies worldwide to mitigate the impact of the coronavirus pandemic.

1378,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 14, 2020 02:04AM ET</span>",Stocks - Europe Seen Just Higher; Eurozone Q2 GDP Data Due,"By Peter Nurse 
Investing.com - European stock markets are seen opening cautiously higher Friday, with Chinese economic data suggesting a slow recovery ahead of the release of quarterly growth numbers for the eurozone.
At 2:05 AM ET (0605 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.2% higher, the CAC 40 futures in France rose 0.1%, while FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. was flat.
Earlier Friday, data showed China’s economic recovery continued in July, although not as robustly as many had hoped from the globe’s second largest economy and one of the most important growth drivers.
Industrial output rose 4.8% in July from a year earlier, below the median estimate of 5.2%, while retail sales were still in negative territory after the year-on-year decline slowed to 1.1%.
The euro zone's preliminary GDP numbers for the second quarter are due late in Friday’s session, and the market consensus suggests a drop of 12% compared with the first quarter and 15% compared with the same quarter last year. 
Also of interest will be the further course of negotiations between the Trump administration and the Democrats in Congress over the size and make up of the next coronavirus relief package. The Senate formally went into recess on Thursday but could return for a vote on any deal, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said. .
In corporate news,  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) is likely to be in the spotlight after the German car manufacturer said late Thursday that it had reached agreements costing nearly $3 billion to settle civil investigations by U.S. regulators and lawsuits from vehicle owners stemming from a long-running probe into software to cheat diesel emissions tests.
Oil prices edged higher Friday, heading for a second consecutive week of gains amid signs the energy demand recovery in the U.S. is gaining traction.
Crude closed at a five-month high on Wednesday, helped by encouraging data on U.S. crude stockpiles as refiners ramped up production and demand for oil products improved.
“This is now the third consecutive week of stock declines, with inventories declining by almost 22.5 million barrels over this period,” said analysts at ING, in a research note.
More pessimistic reports from the International Energy Agency and the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries weighed during the week, but the overall tone within the oil market has turned positive.
The OPEC+ producer bloc, which also includes Russia, will meet next week in the form of its Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee to discuss production levels.
U.S. crude futures traded 0.4% higher at $42.39 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract rose 0.4% to $45.14. 
Elsewhere, gold futures fell 0.6% to $1,958.30/oz, continuing to trade in an elevated range just below the $2,000 level. EUR/USD traded 0.1% higher at 1.1820."

Auditor Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu Jaiyos Co Ltd said it could not reach a conclusion on the statements due to issues including a lack of liquidity and debt defaults which created ""material uncertainty"" and may affect the value of assets and liabilities. 
Thai Airways is under bankruptcy protection and is due to submit its rehabilitation plan to the bankruptcy court on Monday.
In a statement, the airline said losses from operations since 2013 had resulted in a capital deficiency.
Thai Airways booked losses of 22.68 billion baht ($730.4 million) and 5.35 billion baht its first and second quarters, respectively, according to a delayed earnings report released late Thursday. 
The collapse of travel and tourism due to the outbreak of the new coronavirus slashed revenue by 23.7% to 38 billion baht in the first quarter, Acting President Chansin Treenuchagron said on Friday. 
In the three months ending in June, it booked 2.49 billion baht in revenue, down 94.1% from the same period a year earlier.

Investing.com – Asian stocks were mixed on Friday morning, with Chinese data released earlier in the day pointing to industrial production’s continuous, albeit slower recovery from the COVID-19 impact, but a bigger-than-expected drop in retail sales.
The National Bureau of Statistics said that industrial production rose 4.8% year-on-year in July, lower than the 5.1% increase in forecasts prepared by Investing.com. But the data also showed that retail sales tumbled 1.1% during the same month, a bigger drop than the forecasted 0.1%. July’s unemployment rate remained unchanged at 5.7%.
China’s Shanghai Composite was down 0.09% by 10:38 PM ET (3:38 AM GMT) while the Shenzhen Component was up 0.63%.
Meanwhile, U.S. and Chinese officials are scheduled to meet on Saturday to discuss trade issues. It is widely expected that they will air other grievances, including U.S. President Donald Trump’s ban on the TikTok and WeChat apps due to take effect from September.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index inched down 0.04%.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 crept up 0.08%, while South Korea’s KOSPI slid 1.31%.
Down Under, the ASX 200 rose 0.50%.
Elsewhere, investors are keeping an eye on the U.S. Congress’ negotiations over the latest stimulus measures, with negotiations between Republicans and Democrats dragging on for a sixth day.
“Investors assumed that a deal would get done in early August. Now that this is not happening, it raises some risks for the economy,” Matt Maley, chief market strategist at Miller Tabak & Co, told Bloomberg.
“Therefore, investors are going back to focusing on what will work even if the economy sputters once again.”
Other investors were cautious about the sturdiness of the U.S. economic recovery, even after the Labor Department said on Thursday that 963,000 Americans claimed unemployment benefits, the first time that the number fell below the one million mark since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.

1382,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 13, 2020 10:00PM ET</span>",U.S. plans major investment program with Colombia: White House,"By Andrea Shalal
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. officials will unveil a major economic investment program with the Colombian government next week as Washington expands its drive to yank supply chains out of China and bring them closer to home, a senior White House official said Thursday. 
Colombia is primed to play a pioneering role in the Trump administration's ""Back to the Americas"" initiative, Mauricio Claver-Carone, U.S. President Donald Trump's senior adviser on Latin America, told Reuters in an interview.
He said the plans also include a rural development project worth billions of dollars to be funded in part by private investors, but gave no further details. 
The announcements come amid rising tensions between the United States and China over human rights, Hong Kong, security and the coronavirus pandemic, which has triggered the worst recession in Latin America since the 1950s.
They will be made during a visit to the region by U.S. National Security Adviser Robert O'Brien, Admiral Craig Faller, commander of U.S. Southern Command, Adam Boehler, chief executive officer of the U.S. International Development Finance Corp (DFC), and himself, Claver-Carone said.
The White House National Security Council first announced the trip on Twitter earlier Thursday, but gave no details. The officials will also visit Panama.
Claver-Carone cited strong private sector interest in the ""Back to the Americas"" program, which will offer as yet undefined financial incentives to U.S. companies to move production facilities back to the region from Asia. 
""There's huge corporate will and we want to take advantage of that,"" he said.
Colombia's ambassador to the United States, Francisco Santos, in April said his country was in talks with several U.S. companies interested in moving facilities there.
Claver-Carone said security issues would also play a key role during the visit to Colombia, which shares a long border with Venezuela, whose socialist leader Nicolas Maduro has been blacklisted by Washington.

1383,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 13, 2020 09:36PM ET</span>",North Korean Leader Replaces Premier as Economy Hit by Floods,"(Bloomberg) -- North Korean leader Kim Jong Un replaced the premier he named about a year ago and lifted a lockdown on the border city of Kaesong put in place on concerns a former defector who crossed back from South Korea brought coronavirus with him.
The moves announced in state media reports Friday come as North Korea is facing flooding set to wipe out farmland and deal another blow to its already staggering economy. The premier is seen as a steward of economic management and naming Kim Tok Hun to the post to replace Kim Jae Ryong could deflect blame off the North Korean leader for any hardships coming from a poor harvest.
The official Korean Central News Agency report said “Kim Jae Ryong was relieved from the premiership.” Kim Tok Hun is a senior cadre who serves as the head of the parliamentary budget committee.
“The North Korean economy is facing a serious challenge now and someone had to take political responsibility,” said Choi Kang, vice-president of the Asan Institute for Policy Studies in Seoul. “This looks like a precautionary measure to offset complaints from North Korean people.”
Kim Jong Un said at a Workers’ Party politburo meeting that flooding has taken a toll but North Korea shouldn’t accept foreign aid because of the coronavirus risk, KCNA said. North Korea has said it doesn’t have any coronavirus cases -- a claim doubted by U.S. and Japanese officials -- and placed Kaesong on lockdown last month after the former defector crossed into the country.
The leader “decided to lift the lockdown of Kaesong city based on scientific evidence,” KCNA added, noting he also ordered measures to further support flood victims.
North Korea has been hit by flooding since earlier this month, as torrential rains threaten to wipe out farmland and the virus-damaged economy heads for what might be its biggest contraction in more than two decades. The flooding has also impacted its Yongbyon nuclear facility, with waters reaching pump houses for mothballed reactors, the 38 North website said based on an analysis of satellite imagery.
Agricultural production is a key element of North Korea’s economy and flooding in its summer months has led to diminished harvest, putting strain on Kim as he battles global sanctions put in place to punish the state for its nuclear and ballistic missile testing. The United Nations World Food Program, which has operations in North Korea, has said about 40% of the population is undernourished, adding “food insecurity and malnutrition are widespread.”
In addition to damage to farmland, Kim’s decision to shut borders in January due to the coronavirus slammed the brakes on the little legal trade the state has, and could send the economy this year into its biggest contraction since 1997, according to Fitch Solutions.

1385,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 13, 2020 07:35PM ET</span>","Australian billionaire woos Canadians, hoping to build big coal mine in Rocky Mountains","By Jeff Lewis
TORONTO (Reuters) - Australian mining magnate Gina Rinehart's Hancock Prospecting Pty is hoping a charm offensive, from annual fundraising parties to local refurbishments at a golf course, will help overcome opposition to a massive new coal mine in Canada’s Rocky Mountains. 
Hancock unit Riversdale Resources’ Grassy Mountain mine, which is forecast to produce 4.5 million tonnes of steelmaking coal per year, would span 2,800 hectares and could set a precedent for new projects in the region. Opponents say the project would harm wildlife and water in the area. 
In June, the province of Alberta, home to most of Canada’s oil reserves, rolled back 1970s-era restrictions on open-pit coal mining to jumpstart an economy hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic and plunging oil prices. 
The proposal for Grassy Mountain predates that change. But Alberta's move is at odds with Liberal Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's effort to wean the country from coal and comes as a growing number of banks, insurers and investors shun the fossil fuel due to climate concerns.
Public hearings are slated to begin in October for the Grassy Mountain, which requires federal and provincial approvals. 
Hancock is among a raft of Australian companies with projects in the region, aiming to ship coking coal from Alberta to Asian markets. Atrum Coal (AX:ATU) and privately held Montem Resources are also pursuing nearby mines and exploration ventures, as is private developer Cabin Ridge Project Ltd.
The company has sponsored annual Australia Day fundraising bashes, and also opened a newly rebuilt golf course this month, accompanying eight new holes at the local Crowsnest Pass Golf Club. The work helped clear the way for a coal loadout near the course.
Hancock, which took over the firm that owned Grassy Mountain last year, matched funds raised at this year's event to support a local senior’s association in Crowsnest Pass, Alberta. 
Still, landowners remain worried about water use and habitat destruction in an ecologically sensitive mountain corridor renowned for postcard scenery and wildlife. 
""I think 10 years down the road the water will be polluted to the point that we may not be able to grow crops,"" said alfalfa farmer Norm Watmough, 76, whose holiday cabin abuts the mine lease. ""It’s going to destroy southern Alberta."" Hancock declined to comment and referred questions to filings in which the company details its plans to treat wastewater. 
Landowners said they are worried that selenium from waste rock could leach into nearby waterways. The company has said in filings that it plans to pump water with high selenium and nitrate concentrations to saturated zones in pits and build waste rock dumps at higher elevations to minimize risks. 
Miners have welcomed Alberta's move to loosen environmental protections to increase open-pit mining along the Rockies' eastern slopes. 
Canada has committed to eliminate coal-fired power by 2030 and last month said it would assess climate impacts of new thermal coal mines and exports. 

Coking coal is ""less of a concern at the present time than thermal coal,"" Canadian Environment and Climate Change Minister Jonathan Wilkinson said. ""But to the extent that there are significant (project) impacts that can't be mitigated, then obviously that becomes a lot more challenging.""

(Reuters) - A former chief executive of Hertz Global Holdings (N:HTZ) will pay $2.18 million to settle U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission charges he failed to reimburse incentive-based pay to the rental car company following a financial restatement.
Without admitting or denying wrongdoing, Mark Frissora agreed to pay $1.98 million to Hertz and a $200,000 civil fine to the SEC, according to settlement papers filed on Thursday with the federal court in Newark, New Jersey.
Frissora, 64, of Naples, Florida, had been Hertz's chief executive from July 2006 to September 2014.
The settlement requires a judge's approval. It follows Hertz's agreement in February 2019 to pay a $16 million civil fine to settle related SEC charges.
A lawyer for Frissora declined to comment.
According to the SEC, Frissora pressured subordinates to ""find money,"" mainly by reassessing reserve accounts, resulting in accounting changes that left Hertz's financial results materially inaccurate.
The SEC said Frissora also led Hertz's decision in 2013 to extend its ""holding periods,"" or estimates for how long it would keep vehicles in its fleet, lowering reported expenses without revealing to investors the risks of holding older vehicles.
In July 2015, Hertz reduced previously reported pretax income by $235 million, and according to the SEC belatedly disclosed the extended holding periods.
Hertz filed for bankruptcy protection in May after its business was decimated during the coronavirus pandemic.

The non-profit organisation said the temporary measures had provided critical aid to families and individuals grappling with the economic fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic, and demand for such support will surge after a nationwide job retention scheme ends on Oct. 31.
A survey of 7,400 employers conducted by the British Chambers of Commerce in July found that 29% expect to cut the size of their workforce before the furlough scheme ends.
Research conducted in the same month by Which? showed workers placed on furlough were three times more likely to have defaulted on at least one payment in the last month.
""The regulator has acted quickly and effectively to help those struggling financially due to the pandemic, but it must be prepared to take further bold action to prevent millions of people from being hit by a perfect storm of financial pressures in the coming months,"" said Which? head of Money Gareth Shaw.
In its response to the FCA consultation on the issue, Which? also urged lenders to offer wider forbearance options such as payment rescheduling or freezing interest when a further payment holiday is not in the consumer's best interest.

It also said normal credit reference agency reporting rules should not be immediately applied after the Oct. 31 deadline and consumers who have already accessed a payment holiday or who seek one between now and Jan. 31 must not have their long-term creditworthiness negatively impacted as a result.

(Reuters) - Plant-based burger maker Impossible Foods said on Thursday it secured $200 million in funding, less than six months after it raised the largest investment ever for a food tech startup, bringing total funds raised since its founding in 2011 to $1.5 billion.
The company, which counts Jay-Z, Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian and singer Katy Perry among others as its investors, said it would use the money to expand research, develop new products and for internal operations. 
Among the first to introduce burgers made from plants that taste and cook like meat, Impossible has been rapidly expanding its retail footprint, selling its products in thousands of grocery and retail U.S. stores, including about 2,000 Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc stores.
In June, Impossible started selling its burgers online in the United States through its website after beef prices shot up as the COVID-19 pandemic forced several meat plants to close.
""Our growth in retail has certainly been a big part of the story... For us, throughout this current (pandemic) period, we've just tried to adjust the way the meat eater is increasingly purchasing the product,"" Chief Financial Officer David Lee said in an interview. 
Impossible Foods and rival Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND) Inc have struck high-profile deals with several restaurant chains, including Subway and KFC, but have had to find new strategies to stay afloat as many chains were forced to limit operations due to the pandemic. 
Impossible's latest funding round, which follows the $500 million raised in March, was led by hedge fund Coatue and included existing investors Mirae Asset Global Investments and Temasek, the company said.

Data tracker Prime Unicorn Index estimates Impossible's valuation at about $4.03 billion following the latest Series G round. The most recent price per share was $16.15, higher than its Series F price of $15.41, according to Prime Unicorn.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Institutional Shareholder Services is pressing ahead with a lawsuit against the Securities Exchange Commission after the securities regulator last month issued a new rule that governs how proxy advisers like ISS advise clients in corporate votes.
ISS told the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia and the SEC on Wednesday that it will ""reactivate"" a lawsuit it originally filed in October and paused in January to give the SEC time to finalize its rule.
The SEC did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Three weeks after SEC commissioners voted three to one in favor of the rule, ISS said it worries the rule will threaten the firm's independence and the way it informs clients on how to vote in U.S. corporations' annual meetings. [L2N2ET0VV]
""We remain concerned that the rule will be used or interpreted in a way that could hamper our ability to continue to deliver to you the timely and independent advice that you rely on to help you make decisions with regard to the governance of your portfolio companies,"" ISS Chief Executive Gary Retelny wrote to clients in a note obtained by Reuters on Thursday. The rule will take effect for the 2022 proxy season. 
The lawsuit is the latest turn in a battle between corporate America, proxy advisory firms and the regulator. Corporations have long argued that ISS and its main rival, Glass Lewis & Co, have too much power in guiding investors on hot-button votes like executive pay and should be more transparent about their recommendations. 

The SEC spent months crafting a new rule that will require proxy advisers to provide a copy of their reports to corporations at the same time they release them to clients. They also will have to inform clients if corporations plan to rebut the reports.

The move comes as North America auto sales gradually recover since hitting a bottom in April, pushing major automakers to ramp up production and boost weak inventories at dealerships.
It is, however, in stark contrast with the broader trend of layoffs across industries that have been ravaged by the COVID-19 pandemic. U.S. employers announced another 262,649 job cuts in July, up 54% from June.

AutoZone said it was adding the jobs across its more than 5,800 U.S. stores.

Data released on Thursday by the Fed showed Main Street loans held by the central bank rose by $131 million to $226 million as of Wednesday from $95 million a week earlier. 
Under the program, the Fed will buy 95% of a loan initiated by a private lender to a qualified business. It has seen limited use since launching last month, but officials have said interest is growing.

Boston Federal Reserve President Eric Rosengren, whose bank is managing the program for the Fed system, on Wednesday said that low use of the program early on is not a sign of failure and that more businesses may turn to the facility in the fall if the economy worsens.

1392,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 13, 2020 05:45PM ET</span>",Top U.S. health official says approval of COVID vaccines unlikely before November,"By Carl O'Donnell and Mrinalika Roy
(Reuters) - Any potential COVID-19 vaccine backed by the Trump administration's ""Operation Warp Speed"" program is unlikely to receive a green light from regulators any earlier than November or December, given the time needed for a large-scale clinical trial, the National Institutes of Health director said on Thursday. 
In a call with reporters, Francis Collins said he thinks testing a vaccine in at least 10,000 people could potentially give enough evidence of safety and efficacy to clear it for wider use. U.S. late-stage vaccine trials launched so far aim to recruit up to 30,000 people. 
""I would not expect to see, on the basis of what we know scientifically, that we would be at the point where the FDA could make such a judgment until considerably later than October 1st,"" Collins said, referring to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. ""Maybe November or December would be my best bet.""
He added that he is confident that at least one of the six vaccines funded by the initiative will be shown to be safe and effective by the end of the year.
President Donald Trump said last week it was possible the United States would have a coronavirus vaccine before the Nov. 3 election, a more optimistic forecast on timing than anything suggested by his own White House health experts.
Collins expects that the first tens of millions of doses of vaccine produced in the United States will be allocated to those most in need, such as patients at higher risk of complications or front line healthcare workers. 
The U.S. government has helped finance the development of several vaccines and therapies through the program aimed at accelerating access to medicines to fight COVID-19.
U.S. public health officials last month charged a group of independent scientists and ethicists with developing guidelines to determine who should get the first doses of a vaccine, once one becomes available.

1393,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 13, 2020 05:35PM ET</span>","U.S. Justice Department says Yale illegally discriminates against Asians, whites","By Jan Wolfe and Eric Beech
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department on Thursday accused Yale University of illegally discriminating against Asian American and white applicants in its undergraduate admissions process in violation of U.S. civil rights law. 
The findings are the result of a two-year investigation in response to a complaint by Asian-American groups concerning Yale's conduct, the department said in a statement.
The department said it was prepared to file a lawsuit against Yale if the school, in New Haven, Connecticut, did not take ""remedial measures.""
A Yale spokeswoman said the university ""categorically denies"" the allegations but has cooperated fully with the investigation.
The Justice Department made its findings before allowing Yale to provide requested documents, Yale said.
""Had the Department fully received and fairly weighed this information, it would have concluded that Yale’s practices absolutely comply with decades of Supreme Court precedent,"" the spokeswoman said.
The Justice Department said that although race can lawfully be considered in college admissions in limited circumstances, ""Yale’s use of race is anything but limited.""
The elite school ""uses race at multiple steps of its admissions process resulting in a multiplied effect of race on an applicant’s likelihood of admission,"" the Justice Department said.
The Justice Department has previously filed legal briefs in support of a lawsuit, brought by affirmative action opponents, accusing Harvard University of discriminating against Asian Americans.
A federal judge in Boston ruled in favor of Harvard last year, saying the school's affirmative action program advanced a legitimate interest in having a diverse student body.
An appeal of that ruling is pending. The case could eventually reach the Supreme Court.
Affirmative action programs in higher education were meant to address racial discrimination. The Supreme Court has ruled universities may use affirmative action with the aim of helping minority applicants get into college.

U.S. conservatives have said that in helping Black and Latino applicants, affirmative action can hurt white people and Asian Americans.

(Reuters) - The S&P 500 ended slightly lower on Thursday after briefly trading above its record closing high level for a second day, and the Dow also fell in the wake of a disappointing forecast from Cisco Systems Inc (O:CSCO).
The benchmark S&P 500 rose as high as 3,387.24 during the session, just above its record high closing level of 3,386.15 from Feb. 19. The record came just before investors sold shares in anticipation of what proved to be the biggest slump in the U.S. economy since the Great Depression. The index's intraday record high of 3,393.52 was also set on Feb. 19. 
An 11.2% slump in shares of Cisco Systems weighed on the Dow and S&P 500 after the company forecast first-quarter revenue and profit below estimates.
Concern about corporate earnings has continued despite a mostly stronger-than-expected second-quarter profit season.
""The outlook for earnings in the next few quarters seems to be getting watered down by a lot of big companies,"" said Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel in Charlottesville, Virginia.
""It's making for a sluggish market without a real catalyst to push it up and over the hurdle for good,"" he said, referring to the S&P 500's record.
Apple Inc (O:AAPL) shares rose 1.8%, helping to support the Nasdaq and limiting losses in the S&P 500.
Also limiting bearishness, jobless claims fell below 1 million for the first time since efforts to curb the COVID-19 outbreak in the United States began five months ago.
Wall Street has recovered most of the trillions in market capitalization lost during the start of the pandemic and the Nasdaq was the first of the three major indexes to hit a record high in June. The Dow remains below its February peak.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) fell 80.12 points, or 0.29%, to 27,896.72, the S&P 500 (SPX) lost 6.92 points, or 0.20%, to 3,373.43 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) added 30.27 points, or 0.27%, to 11,042.50.
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits decreased to 963,000 for the week ended Aug. 8, the lowest level since mid-March. But the expiration of a $600 weekly jobless supplement at the end of July likely contributed to the decline.
Data last week showed the economy had regained only 9.3 million of the 22 million jobs lost between February and April, indicating a long road to reach pre-pandemic levels.
Investors continue to hold on to hopes Democrats and the White House can reach agreement on a stimulus package to help the economy recover. Unemployment benefits have been a sticking point in their talks. 
The U.S. presidential election is expected to add another layer of uncertainty into markets, with roughly 12 weeks remaining until Election Day.
Among declining stocks, Tapestry Inc (N:TPR) fell 1.1% even as it beat quarterly sales estimates.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.42-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.21-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
The S&P 500 posted 15 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 62 new highs and 18 new lows.

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 8.70 billion shares, compared with the 10.2 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203) and Mazda Motor Corp (T:7261) said on Thursday they will invest $2.3 billion in a new joint venture factory in Alabama, $830 million more than announced in their original plan in 2018.
Production is expected to start next year building up to 150,000 future Mazda crossover vehicles and 150,000 Toyota sport utility vehicles annually. The Japanese automakers are expected to receive $97 million in additional tax incentives for the added investment, a person briefed on the matter said.
The automakers have faced challenges as they continued construction work during the coronavirus pandemic on the plant, which will now cost about 50% more than first estimated.
The companies said the higher investment ""accommodates production line enhancements made to improve manufacturing processes.""
The plant continues to target up to 4,000 new jobs and has hired approximately 600 employees to date.
""Mazda and Toyota’s increased commitment to the development of this manufacturing plant reiterates their belief in the future of manufacturing in America and the potential for the state of Alabama to be an economic leader in the wake of unprecedented economic change,"" Alabama Governor Kay Ivey said in a statement.
The companies said the plant's roofing, siding, floor slabs, ductwork, fire protection and electrical work is 75% to 100% complete.
State and local governments in Alabama previously provided more than $700 million in tax incentives.
In September, President Donald Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe signed a limited trade deal that cuts tariffs on U.S. farm goods, Japanese machine tools and other products but delayed the question of auto imports for future talks.
Trump threatened hikes but did not raise current auto tariffs of 2.5% on passenger vehicles and 25% on pickup trucks.

Japan exported 1.7 million vehicles last year to the United States, making up about 10% of U.S. vehicle sales.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 hobbled to negative close on Thursday as its tech-infused advance faded with investors weighing signs of the strength in labor market against worries about the economic recovery as stimulus talks are on ice until September.
The S&P 500 fell 0.22%, failing in its bid to close above the Feb.19 record high of 3,386.15, after struggling to hold gains at a session high of 3,387. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.29%, or 80 points, while the Nasdaq Composite added 0.27%.
Big tech’s dominance was on display again as the broader market retreated after the Fab 5 ran out of steam.
Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) closed negative, while Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) closed below their session highs.
Apple closed up more than 1% on news the tech giant is set to launch a range of service bundles in October that could rival services to compete with Peloton Interactive (NASDAQ:PTON).
The broader market's struggle to close above all-time highs comes as investors continue to fret over the lack of progress on talks over the next wave of coronavirus stimulus, which may be on hold until next month as the U.S. Senate takes a break.
Without further stimulus, many fear the recovery in the economy will likely fade at a time when the labor market continues to bounce back.          
The Labor Department reported that 963,000 Americans filed initial claims for unemployment insurance through Aug. 8, down from 1.2 million a week earlier.
This was the first time since March that claims were below 1 million, adding to investor optimism that a broader economic recovery remains on solid footing despite a lack of progress on a new stimulus plan.
“This week's claims data is the first full week of claims after the August 1 expiration of the enhanced $600 per week benefit provided by the CARES Act,” Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) said. “The data of the past two weeks will not help the arguments of lawmakers fighting to extend the expired benefits.”
The Trump administration last week rejected an offer by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on a reduced $2 trillion aid bill.
Value stocks - those tied to the progress of the economy - also added downside pressure, paced by weakness in energy and financials.   
Energy stocks were pressured by a fall in oil prices as worries about demand resurfaced.
The International Energy Agency slashed its oil demand forecast for the year, by 8.1 million barrels per day, citing reduced air travel.

 Lyft  (NASDAQ:LYFT) fell 5.4% after reporting second-quarter revenue fell 61% as the pandemic brought its ride-sharing business to a halt
“Lyft delivered 2Q results in-line with our expectations and with consensus, but July (and early August) trends are pointing to 3Q results below current consensus,” Wedbush warned in a note as it cut its price target on the stock to $37 from $48."

Investing.com  --  Markets mostly went south Thursday as the U.S. Senate went on vacation. There's no coronavirus relief package in sight as lawmakers are out until September.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 were down, while the NASDAQ Composite closed up. 
Without further stimulus, many fear the recovery in the economy will likely fade. Value stocks - those tied to the progress of the economy - added downside pressure to the market, paced by weakness in energy and financials.     
Here are three things that may move markets tomorrow:
1. Economic data
U.S. retail sales are likely to have increased in July, though nowhere near the May and June jumps. The forecast for the month is that sales rose 1.9% to May's 18.2% and June's 7.5%. The report is expected at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT).
2. Earnings 
DraftKings (NASDAQ:DKNG) is expected to report a loss per share of 20 cents on sales of $64 million. Shares of the fantasy sports betting provider may be lacking in actual games to bet on, but investors have pushed shares up more than 225% since the start of 2020.
Speaking of no games, Madison Square Garden Sports Corp (NYSE:MSGS) is set to publish a loss per share of $4.43 on sales of $18.8 million.
3. Tensions on tap
On Saturday, the U.S. and China are set to sit down and review the terms of their phase one trade deal activated on Feb. 15. U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Chinese Vice Premier Liu He will participate in the video meeting, Reuters reported.
Under the first phase, China pledged to boost purchases of U.S. goods by some $200 billion over 2017 levels, but because of coronavirus-driven sinking of the global economy, it has had a hard time doing so. There may also be talk of U.S. President Donald Trump's threat to ban Chinese apps, including TikTok.

1401,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 13, 2020 03:27PM ET</span>",Democrats Suffer Deeper Job Losses Than Republicans in Pandemic,"(Bloomberg) -- The pandemic has caused considerably deeper job losses for Americans who are likely to support Democrats compared with those who lean Republican, according to an economist who assessed voting tendencies from employment data.
July data from the Labor Department, combined with a Harvard University study, show the likely Democratic unemployment rate at 11.7% and the probable Republican rate at 7.6%, Jed Kolko, chief economist at jobs website Indeed, said in a Twitter thread Thursday. Measures such as the prime-age employment-population ratio have rebounded more for GOP leaners too, Kolko said.
The estimates reflect the recession’s impact on minorities, women and big cities, because they predict a respondent’s vote based on demographic variables including age, race and sex. The figures may also provide some background for the stalemate between the White House and congressional Democrats over a new aid package after $600 a week in federal benefits expired at the end of July.
President Donald Trump used executive actions over the weekend to redirect disaster-relief funds to provide $300 a week in federal aid to the unemployed, plus $100 in state funds after Congress could not agree on a new stimulus package.
Trump has touted his strength on the economy as a reason why voters should reelect him in November. Yet the disparity in the pandemic’s impact could potentially fuel more votes for Democratic challenger Joe Biden, who leads in polls.
“Like past recessions, unemployment is higher for African-Americans and Hispanics,” Kolko said on Twitter. “But unlike past ones, this is more a big-city recession and a ‘shecession.’” The virus has caused women to lose jobs at higher rates due to factors including their likeliness to work in the service industry and a disproportionate rate of child-care responsibilities.

1402,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 13, 2020 02:54PM ET</span>",Trump Claims a Lead in Global Rebound With Cherry-Picked Data,"(Bloomberg) -- President Donald Trump says America is leading the global economic and financial market recovery. Others contest that claim, while the data -- as usual -- depend on how you parse them.
“Our economy is performing significantly better than Europe -- which people have to understand very strongly,” Trump said at a press briefing Wednesday. “We’re working with Europe on their difficulties, and we are going to help them all the way.”
Trump’s comments came just hours after two senior Federal Reserve officials lamented that the U.S.’s failure to contain the coronavirus put the nation at risk of a prolonged economic downturn. They contrasted the situation to Europe, where they said a more forceful response to the pandemic has positioned countries for a quicker comeback.
Data show Europe’s stronger lockdowns likely contributed to its bigger GDP decline earlier, but may be helping it more recently. Indicators such as credit-card use, travel and location information show euro-area economies such as Germany, France, and Italy, along with Norway and Japan, are closest to their pre-pandemic readings, while Spain is falling behind slightly, according to Bloomberg Economics. The U.K., U.S. and Canada are still far below their levels of activity at the start of the year.
And most economists say that while U.S. spending and jobs rose sharply in May and early June, activity has since flattened out, suggesting a longer slog of a recovery.
“Europe went down harder and is now bouncing stronger,” said Bruce Kasman chief economist and head of global economic research at JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co. “Ultimately we think Europe does better because of its handling of the virus.”
Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren is among those that have picked up on that trend. “Visits by Europeans to retail and recreation locations have now experienced a more robust recovery compared with American visits to such locations and are close to their pre-pandemic levels,” he said Wednesday.
Stock Market Performance
Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan also flagged that other countries “are recovering at a very rapid rate” after pulling down their infection rates.
Asked about those comments, Trump blamed Democratic governors for failing to open up their states as causing a “headwind” for the economy. “They just want to keep these people in their houses, in their prisons,” he said.
Trump also touted America’s stock market performance.
“The United States is leading the world very substantially” when it comes to the rebound in equities in recent months, He said since March America’s stock-market capitalization has risen by $9 trillion, “a number that nobody’s ever heard of before.”
Actually, it’s up more than $12 trillion from the bottom in March, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. But the S&P 500 Index has underperformed by some measures over the past two months, since the spread of the coronavirus accelerated in the U.S. Its 11% gain is behind the 14% rise in the Shanghai Composite, and in line with the Euro Stoxx 600 in dollar terms.
“The stock market’s rebound signals a V-shaped recovery,” Trump said.
The president made his case with charts, trumpeting “the shallowest contraction, which is a big deal” in the economy.
That depends on how it’s measured, however. U.S. gross domestic product shrank 9.5% in the second quarter from a year before, against a 15% slide in the euro region. But some of that outperformance owes to stronger growth in the second half of 2019, rather than superior handling of Covid-19. The U.S. slide on an annualized basis was 32.9%, the worst reading in a data series going back to the 1940s. Meantime, China’s GDP rose last quarter.
GLOBAL INSIGHT: Alt-Data Show Growth Plateauing, Far From Normal
Trump also highlighted a rebound in homebuilding, auto sales and manufacturing, along with employment.
Indeed, most measures of housing have shown “v shaped recoveries,” Michael Feroli, a colleague of Kasman’s at JPMorgan, wrote recently. But credit-card spending data have been softening, likely due to the resurgence in Covid-19, he also said.
The expiry of supplementary unemployment benefits in July also threatens to undermine a rebound in spending. While Trump has signed executive orders offering some relief, economists say it’s no replacement for another broad fiscal package of at least $1 trillion -- over which Republicans and Democrats are deadlocked.
“If this is all we get for fiscal policy for the rest of the year it would represent a significant downside risk to our growth outlook,” Feroli said.

1403,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 13, 2020 02:45PM ET</span>",California startup aims to tackle battery degradation in electric cars,"By Stephen Nellis
(Reuters) - Lithium-ion batteries are essential to electric vehicles, but they have drawbacks: They are hard to make and degrade over time.
A San Leandro, California-based start-up on Thursday said it had raised $4 million in funding and is working with German chemical giant BASF SE (OTC:BASFY) on a new technology to tackle those problems, aiming one day to reduce the cost of lithium ion batteries while boosting their capacities and extending their lifetimes.
Coreshell Technologies makes a coating that would go directly onto the surface of the electrodes in lithium-ion batteries. 
To produce power, lithium ions move back and forth between electrodes inside the battery. But as they pass through layers, some of the lithium gets stuck, both depleting it and making it harder for remaining ions to move back and forth.
Coreshell said its coating allows the lithium to pass through more easily and without getting stuck, which speeds up the break-in process during battery manufacturing, allows less lithium to be used and could mean longer battery life. But the key advance, the company's founders said, was figuring out how to apply the coating in a liquid form as the electrode layers are manufactured on ""roll-to-roll"" machinery that resembles a newspaper printing press.
""It has to fit into that style of processing"" to be economically feasible, said Jonathan Tan, the company's CEO and co-founder. ""And that's not something that anyone has been able to do before with these coatings.""
Coreshell is working with BASF, a major supplier of high energy density cathode active materials in batteries, to test its coatings with BASF materials. A BASF spokeswoman said Coreshell's coatings have demonstrated performance improvements over standard materials.
Coreshell on Thursday said the $4 million in funding was raised in a financing round led by Entrada Ventures. Other backers in the funding round included Baruch Future Ventures, Tsingyuan Ventures, the California Energy Commission, Sema Translink, Berkeley Skydeck and Alchemist Accelerator, Coreshell said.

1404,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 13, 2020 02:36PM ET</span>",Former Fed Chair Janet Yellen Advising Biden and Harris,"(Bloomberg) -- Joe Biden and Kamala Harris received their first joint economic briefing on Thursday, which included former Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen.
Two of Biden’s longtime economic advisers, Jared Bernstein and Heather Boushey, were among those in the briefing, in addition to Yellen, Raj Chetty, a Harvard University professor, and Lisa Cook, a professor at Michigan State University. Jake Sullivan, a top policy adviser to Biden, was also in the briefing.
The Biden campaign has been very secretive about the economists who have been advising the former vice president during his campaign. But in April, Bloomberg News reported that Larry Summers was advising the campaign, which drew the ire on progressives who called on Biden to promise he would not appoint him to his administration.

1405,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 13, 2020 02:33PM ET</span>",S&P 500 Push for Record Close Falters as Big Tech Gives Up Some Gains,"By Yasin Ebrahim
Investing.com – The S&P 500 turned negative as big tech eased from session highs pared and stocks tied to the progress of the economy were ditched despite upbeat labor market data suggesting the recovery remained intact.
The S&P 500 fell 0.24% as it struggled to hold gains in a bid to close above the Feb.19 record high of 3,386.15, having advanced to a session high of 3,387. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.36%, or 100 points, while the Nasdaq Composite added 0.29%.
The Labor Department reported that 963,000 Americans filed initial claims for unemployment insurance through Aug. 8, down from 1.2 million a week earlier.
This was the first time since March that claims were below 1 million, adding to investor optimism that a broader economic recovery remains on solid footing despite a lack of progress on Capitol Hill on a new stimulus plan.
“This week's claims data is the first full week of claims after the August 1 expiration of the enhanced $600 per week benefit provided by the CARES Act,” Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) said. “The data of the past two weeks will not help the arguments of lawmakers fighting to extend the expired benefits.”
Stimulus talks among U.S. lawmakers have hit a dead end as Democrats and Republicans struggle to resolve their difference over the size of the next stimulus bill.
The Trump administration last week rejected an offer by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on a reduced $2 trillion aid bill.
The stalled talks have prompted investors to pull their bullish bets on value stocks - those tied to the progress of the economy. While the bid in growth stocks faded as the Fab 5 gave up some gains.
Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) turned negative, while Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) eased from session highs.
Apple was up more than 1% on news the tech giant is set to launch a range of service bundles in October that could also rival services to compete with Peloton Interactive (NASDAQ:PTON).
Energy stocks were pressured by a fall in oil prices as worries about demand resurfaced.
The International Energy Agency slashed its oil demand forecast for the year, by 8.1 million barrels per day (bpd), citing reduced air travel.
On the earnings front, Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) reported weaker guidance that offset better-than-expected quarterly results, sending its shares down nearly 12%.
LYFT (NASDAQ:LYFT) fell nearly 5% after reporting second-quarter revenue fell 61% as the pandemic brought its ride-sharing business to a halt
“Lyft delivered 2Q results in-line with our expectations and with consensus, but July (and early August) trends are pointing to 3Q results below current consensus,” Wedbush warned in a note as it cut its price target on the stock to $37 from $48."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Short-seller Andrew Left is betting the Trump Administration's hardening line on U.S.-listed Chinese companies will help derail a rally in the shares of GSX Techedu Inc (N:GSX), which have surged some 200% since his firm announced its short position in the stock.
The Beijing-based online education company has been attacked by short sellers, including Andrew Left's Citron Capital, which has accused it of overstating revenue by up to 70%.
That's done little to stem the rise in the company's shares, part of a global stock surge that has trampled bearish bets across markets.
""Yes, it obviously sucks being short while the stock was going higher,"" Left said on Wednesday. ""But I have confidence the system will work eventually.""
Left, editor of the online investment newsletter Citron Research, published a short report on GSX in mid April.
GSX, which has called Citron's allegations false and ungrounded, said it had no further comment.
Fresh hope for Left came earlier this week, when U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Monday said companies from China and other countries that do not comply with accounting standards will be delisted from U.S. stock exchanges as of the end of 2021.
""It gives me more confidence. It makes me think that Deloitte will take a second look at this,"" Left said.
GSX's auditor Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu did not respond to a request for comment.
The relentless rally in stocks has pressured some bearish investors betting against individual stocks as well as broader markets.
Influential U.S. investors, including David Tepper and Stanley Druckenmiller, cast doubt on the rally earlier in the year. Druckenmiller in June said he had become more bullish on stocks.
Citron Capital returned 43% after fees in 2019, its first year in business. 
Left did not provide numbers for the fund's 2020 performance.

1407,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 13, 2020 02:10PM ET</span>",Weak demand for record-size 30-year U.S. debt auction,"By Kate Duguid
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The record-size auction of $26 billion 30-year bonds by the U.S. Treasury Department on Thursday sold poorly, with the bid-to-cover ratio, a measure of overall demand, at 2.41, the lowest since July 2019. 
Investors had modest appetite for the offering, which was $4 billion larger than the last auction of new 30-year bonds in May. The Treasury last week increased auction sizes across the curve and said that it plans to continue to shift more of its funding to longer-dated debt in coming quarters as it finances measures to offset the impact of the coronavirus epidemic.
Yields on the 30-year bond (US30YT=RR) had risen to their highest level in a month in anticipation of the additional supply. The yield continued to rise following the auction after the new debt sold at a high yield of 1.406%, the second-highest rate offered since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic Treasury data showed. 
Indirect bidders, a proxy for foreign buyers, took 59.83% of the supply, while direct bidders took 11.87%. Primary dealers, who are responsible for buying all remaining supply after the indirect and direct bids, took 28.3%, higher than the May takedown of 21.4%. 
Earlier in the week, record-sized auctions of new 10-year and 3-year notes were sold to strong demand. The yields on both had risen ahead of the auction, making them more attractive to investors.

Chief Compliance Officer Mike Roemer will be replaced by Paula Dominick, who has been chief compliance officer for  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Americas and previously worked for Bank of America Corp (N:BAC), according to the report https://www.ft.com/content/ffeb7a3b-6908-4ea5-a848-841bad14297b. 
Wells Fargo declined to comment on the report.
The move comes after Wells Fargo said in July that Mike Santomassimo would replace John Shrewsberry as chief financial officer when he retires in the fall after more than two decades at the firm.
Since taking over as chief executive in October, Charles Scharf has shaken up leadership at the bank and installed a slew of former colleagues and confidants in top positions. 
The change at Wells Fargo also comes as it gears up to launch a broad cost-cutting initiative this year and continues to work through expensive regulatory and operational problems tied to a long-running sales scandal.

1410,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 13, 2020 01:30PM ET</span>",Pharmacy to pay $3.5 million to resolve U.S. claims it helped Teva pay kickbacks,"By Nate Raymond
BOSTON (Reuters) - A Florida-based specialty pharmacy will pay $3.5 million to resolve allegations it served as a conduit for a Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (NYSE:TEVA) Ltd subsidiary to pay kickbacks to Medicare patients, the U.S. Justice Department said on Thursday.
The settlement with Advanced Care Scripts Inc was the latest to result from an industry-wide U.S. probe of drugmakers' financial support of patient assistance charities that has resulted in nearly $921 million in settlements.
Representatives for Teva and ACS did not respond to requests for comment. Teva has said it has been cooperating with the investigation since first receiving a subpoena from the U.S. Attorney's Office in Boston in 2017.
Drug companies are prohibited from subsidizing co-payments for patients enrolled in the government's Medicare healthcare program for those aged 65 and older. Companies may donate to non-profits providing co-pay assistance as long as they are independent.
But the government has alleged that various drugmakers have used such charities as means to improperly pay the co-pay obligations of Medicare patients using their drugs, in violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute.
According to the government, until 2015, ACS served as a vendor for Teva Neuroscience Inc and provided, among other things, benefits investigation services to patients who had been prescribed its multiple sclerosis drug Copaxone.
As part of the settlement, ACS acknowledged it relayed data to Teva from two foundations that helped cover the co-pay obligations for Medicare patients using Copaxone, so the drugmaker could correlate the payments it made to the charities.
Those charities were the Chronic Disease Fund, now known as Good Days, and the Assistance Fund. They previously resolved similar allegations with the government for $2 million and $4 million, respectively.
Neither admitted wrongdoing as part of those accords. The charities did not respond to requests for comment on Thursday.

For the third quarter, Vroom (NASDAQ:VRM) forecast total revenue would be in the range of $268 million to $290 million, with a net loss per share of between 42 cents and 37 cents. That compares to the FactSet estimate of $344.6 million. 
For the second quarter, comparing to the same period in 2019, total units sold decreased 8% to 11,082; revenue fell 3% to $253 million; and gross profit dropped 45% to $7.6 million. 
Earlier this month, Carvana said second quarter sales rose to $1.12 billion from $986.2 million a year earlier. 
Vroom reported a second quarter loss per share of 34 cents versus the expected loss of 63 cents. Sales of $253.1 million compared to the estimated $234.9 million.
There is more demand for used cars ""than we can currently fulfill,"" Vroom Chief Executive Officer Paul Hennessy told Reuters, citing a 20% increase in cities that may indicate people are buying cars as they abandon urban living.

CEO Tim Hoettges made the comments as officials finish crafting legislation on rules to assess vendors' fitness to equip German networks, which would be subject to a government review whose terms have yet to be agreed.
Hoettges said policy-makers had made a conscious decision not to impose up-front bans on vendors for political reasons. Even so, the Bonn-based group was broadening the supplier base serving its European operations.
""Regardless of politics, we should never allow dependence on one provider,"" Hoettges told reporters on a conference call after Deutsche Telekom published strong second-quarter results. [nL8N2FF0TX]
Huawei is the main supplier of radio access equipment for Deutsche Telekom's new 5G network in Germany - a relationship that has been criticized by some lawmakers who view the Chinese firm as a national security risk. Huawei says its gear is safe.
But, taking all the European countries where it does business together, Deutsche Telekom's supplier base is broader. It relies on U.S. suppliers for 30% of all technology purchases, with European and Chinese suppliers accounting for 25% each.
Hoettges also called for the use of open, cloud-based technology for networks - known as OpenRAN - to be anchored in German legislation as this would be important for Deutsche Telekom's future network development.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - New regulations took effect on Thursday barring the U.S. government from buying goods or services from any company that uses products from five Chinese companies including Huawei Technologies, Hikvision and Dahua, a U.S. official said.
The rule, which was prompted by a 2019 law, could have far-ranging implications for companies that sell goods and services to the U.S. government, since they will now need to certify they do not use products from Zhejiang Dahua Technology Co Ltd (SZ:002236) or Hangzhou Hikvision Digital Technology Co Ltd (SZ:002415), even though both are among the top sellers of surveillance equipment and cameras worldwide. 
The same goes for two-way radios from Hytera Communications Corp Ltd (SZ:002583) and telecommunications equipment or mobile devices like smartphones from Huawei Technologies Co or ZTE (HK:0763) Corp (SZ:000063). 
Reuters first reported in July that the rule would take effect Aug. 13.
Ellen Lord, the under secretary of defense for acquisition and sustainment, said Thursday the Defense Department ""fully supports"" the intent of the changes ""but recognizes the implementation challenges facing industry partners.""
Her staff was working with Congress to help ""draft revisions to (the law) to facilitate effective implementation and to preclude untended consequences,"" Lord said.
Any company using equipment or services in day-to-day operations from these five companies will no longer be able to sell to the U.S. government without obtaining a government waiver.
The U.S. government annually awards more than $500 billion in contracts, according to the Government Accountability Office.
Last year, the United States placed Huawei, Hikvision and other firms on its economic blacklist, barring the firms from buying components from U.S. companies without U.S. government approval. The U.S. added the Chinese firms after concluding they were engaged in activities contrary to the interests of U.S. national security or foreign policy.
The Information Technology Industry Council (ITI) noted Thursday the regulations were only published a month ago even though the law requiring the changes was passed in 2019. 
""Because of the extended time it took to roll out rules for these far-reaching requirements, contractors may not be able to consistently meet the law’s objectives.""

Federal contractors had to examine company records to ensure the absence of the named Chinese equipment and services companies.

The checks were made following  Western Digital  (NASDAQ:WDC)'s revenue miss earlier this month, and Ho said demand has ""dropped off sharply since mid-June.""
He also cut Micron's price target to $48 from $60. Ho's view goes against the majority.
The stock has 18 buy ratings, seven holds and one sell, with an average price target of $65.10, according to analysts tracked by Investing.com.
Shares are down 16% since the start of 2020. The company's profit and sales results have beat forecasts for the past six quarters. Earnings are expected to be released on Sept. 24.

McElroy takes over the role of CEO, general insurance from Zaffino in a move that gives Zaffino more time to spend on corporate-wide initiatives and puts him in place to eventually take over as CEO from Brian Duperreault,  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) analyst Elyse Greenspan said.

The average for a 30-year loan climbed to 2.96% this week, up from 2.88%, which was the lowest in almost 50 years of data-keeping by  Freddie Mac  (OTC:FMCC). The rate fell below 3% for the first time in July, a slide in borrowing costs that began earlier this year as Covid-19 roiled financial markets.
The low rates have made purchases more affordable and put money back in the pockets of homeowners who’ve refinanced, making housing a bright spot in an economy otherwise ravaged by the pandemic. Sales of both new and previously owned houses have surged, and more renters have become buyers.
“Homebuyer demand remains strong, especially for those in search of an entry-level home where the improvement in affordability via lower mortgage rates has a material impact,” Sam Khater, Freddie Mac’s chief economist, said in a statement.

The U.S. lab equipment supplier's 11.3 billion euro bid was scuppered when only 44% of Qiagen shares were tendered by a Monday deadline, short of the two thirds it needed, following a hedge fund's campaign to reject the offer. 
Qiagen vowed in a statement to ""deliver growth and create greater value.""
""The magnitude and duration of the global coronavirus pandemic have proven the increasingly critical importance of molecular testing to society. Qiagen’s business prospects have improved significantly,"" said Chief Executive Thierry Bernard.
Operating income jumped 84% to $186 million during the first half, as extraordinary demand for molecular technology to detect the new pathogen outweighed negative effects from lockdown measures. 
Qiagen added that it now plans to buy the 80.1% it does not already own of NeuMoDx Molecular Inc, a supplier of testing gear for COVID-19 and other infections, for about $234 million.
Activist investor Davidson Kempner, owner of an 8% stake in Qiagen which campaigned against Thermo Fisher's bid, said management should now improve its interactions with shareholders, focus on high-growth businesses and be disciplined about its investments. 
Evercore ISI analysts said they were doubtful a new industrial bidder was waiting in the wings as the longevity of COVID diagnostics demand was very hard to predict and earnings and market valuation may be peaking. 
Thermo Fisher in July sweetened its offer to 43 euros per share from 39 euros after pressure from some investors, but still did not win over Davidson Kempner.
As part of the sweetened offer, Thermo Fisher also reduced the minimum acceptance threshold from 75% of outstanding ordinary share capital.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets were mixed after early trade on Thursday, with tech stocks outperforming, after data that showed the U.S. labor market continuing to improve despite the ongoing high number of infections and deaths from the Covid-19 virus.
The Labor Department said 963,000 people filed initial claims for jobless benefits last week, with a further 489,000 filing for Pandemic Unemployment Assistance. While those numbers are still - in the words of Grant Thornton Chief Economist Diane Swonk - ""staggeringly high"", they were the lowest since March, and comfortably below consensus expectations. 
Continuing claims, meanwhile, fell to just under 16 million, a number that underlines the importance of breaking a deadlock on Capitol Hill on the next round of fiscal relief measures for the economy. With another 2.2 million people ending their claims for PUA in the week to July 25, the total number of people claiming under various programs fell to 28.26 million people from 31.32 million the previous week.
By 10:10 AM ET (1410 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average had fallen 21 points, or 0.1%, to 27,955 points. The S&P 500 was up less than 0.1% but the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.5%.
Among individual stocks, online car seller  Vroom  (NASDAQ:VRM) stock fell 16.9% after it reported a widening loss in its first quarterly report since going public. Telecoms network equipment maker Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) stock fell 10.8% after it posted its first annual revenue decline in three years and laid out a restructuring plan.
 Lyft  (NASDAQ:LYFT) stock fell 4.7% after it reported a sharp drop in rides in the second quarter. The report came only a day after California ordered the company and its bigger rival, Uber (NYSE:UBER), to classify their drivers as employees. Lyft President John Zimmer told analysts it would have to suspend operations in California temporarily unless it can overturn the ruling on appeal. 
Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) stock rose 1.2% amid a steady drumbeat of positive media coverage of the company, which broadens the e-commerce possibilities for small and medium-sized businesses.
In other markets, the Dollar Index weakened again, but 10-Year bond yields and Gold Futures were roughly unchanged in the wake of the jobless data.

The bundles, dubbed ""Apple One"" inside the Cupertino, California-based company, are planned to launch as early as October alongside its next iPhones, the report said, citing people with knowledge of the effort.
The bundles are designed to encourage customers to subscribe to more Apple services, which will generate more recurring revenue, according to the report.
Apple did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.
Apple's services business, which includes iCloud and Apple Music, has been growing at a rapid pace as it adds more digital offerings to diversify its business at a time when iPhone sales start to mature in key geographies.
According to Bloomberg, the company is also developing a new subscription for virtual fitness classes that can be accessed through apps on the iPhone, iPad and Apple TV and will be offered in a higher-end bundle with the rest of its services.
The service would compete with virtual classes offered by companies, including Peloton Interactive (NASDAQ:PTON) Inc and  Nike  Inc (NYSE:NKE), it added.
With millions of Americans choosing to exercise at home, demand for fitness apps is surging. While Peloton crossed 1 million subscribers in May, Nike said it added 25 million new members in the fourth quarter across its platforms.
Adding to existing services, Apple last year launched an ambitious video-streaming service, called Apple TV+, along with its credit card, a subscription news app and a videogame service.
Shares of Apple have risen nearly 54% this year and are just $16 away from making the iPhone maker the first publicly listed U.S. company to hit a $2 trillion market capitalization.

LONDON (Reuters) - One of the world's largest gold-backed exchange traded funds (ETFs), run by asset manager Invesco, has cut the fee it charges investors to compete better with lower cost funds that are increasing their share of the market.
Investors have rushed to buy gold this year in the hope it will maintain its value through the coronavirus crisis. Prices are up around 30% this year to record highs around $2,000 an ounce, and ETFs storing gold bars have boomed.
More than 100 funds around the world between them added almost 900 tonnes of gold worth $60 billion to their stockpiles in the year to July 31, according to the World Gold Council.
Low-fee funds have grown the fastest.
Five of the funds that hold more than $1 billion worth of gold (around 15 tonnes) expanded by more than 50% in the first seven months of 2020. All charge less than 0.2% of the value of an investment per year.
Invesco said this week it would reduce the fee on its fund, which trades in London, to 0.15% from 0.19%, having already reduced it from 0.24% in February.
The move comes after a competitor, Blackrock (NYSE:BLK)'s London-listed iShares fund, cut its fee to 0.15% from 0.25% at the start of 2020.
The iShares fund grew 65% to 237 tonnes in the year to July 31 while Invesco's expanded 46% to 213 tonnes.
""There is clearly strong price competition in this space and the strong growth in assets that we have seen has enabled us to pass through the benefits of scale to our investors,"" said Chris Mellor, an executive at Invesco.
Higher gold prices means funds can lower fees without losing money.
While lower-fee ETFs are growing fastest, the largest funds are still adding more gold in absolute terms.
SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE:GLD), with a fee of 0.4%, swelled its stockpile by 39% to 1,242 tonnes in the year to July 31. It says that while its fee is higher, its size makes it cheaper and more efficient to trade.

1431,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 13, 2020 08:31AM ET</span>",Lockdown lands domestic abuse on British financial sector radar,"By Sinead Cruise and Kirstin Ridley
LONDON (Reuters) - Some of Britain's biggest financial and legal firms have stepped up support for staff and customers suffering domestic abuse after the coronavirus lockdown shed new light on the scale of a problem affecting millions nationwide.
Legislation now progressing through parliament suggests this is costing Britain 66 billion pounds ($86 billion) a year, with official figures estimating around 2 million people, mainly women aged 16 to 74, suffer some form of domestic abuse.
The Domestic Abuse Bill will introduce a statutory definition that includes physical violence but also emotional, coercive and economic abuse, after extensive lobbying by the charity Surviving Economic Abuse and the financial sector.
As the coronavirus pandemic forces millions to work from home and calls to helplines surge, Lloyds Banking Group (L:LLOY) and NatWest Group (L:NWG) have teamed up with charities SafeLives and Surviving Economic Abuse to offer financial as well as practical aid to victims.
And with remote working increasing social isolation, some firms are also striving to help staff.
Lloyds, Britain's biggest retail bank with about 65,000 employees, has launched an emergency programme that offers vulnerable staff and their children refuge in a hotel, travel and living expenses, as well as advice and compassionate leave. 
Law firm Linklaters is offering a similar package, saying the crisis had put the onus on employers to tackle what the United Nations calls a ""shadow pandemic"" of violence against women.
""For too long it has been left to a small number of highly specialist, feminist organisations to make the case for bringing an end to domestic abuse, and trying to find the means to do that,"" SafeLives' Chief Executive Suzanne Jacob said.
""As major companies start to think in a new way about their workforce and their customers, so much more is possible.""
Domestic abuse charity Refuge said it has received more than 40,000 calls since Britain's lockdown began in March and, as restrictions eased, the number of people needing emergency accommodation rose 54% in the first week of July.
The FICC Markets Standards Board last month warned that abuse can go undetected without face-to-face interaction, which has declined during widespread remote working.
""What could have been seen purely as a domestic issue all of a sudden was more clearly a workplace issue and you have to take action,"" Jenny Lloyd, diversity and wellbeing manager at Linklaters, said.
The Metropolitan Police, which covers London, said domestic violence reports rose by a third in the six weeks to April 24, while its officers made around 100 arrests a day.
""With more people working from home than ever before, this issue needs urgent attention in many employers,"" a spokesman for employee union Unite said. 
CRITICAL ROLE
Economic or financial abuse can leave victims with no access to money or bank accounts and vulnerable to debts built up by their partners, even after they have fled an abusive home.
With thousands of tell-tale datapoints at their fingertips, financial firms are often on the frontline of the fight against such abuse, but cannot act before a customer asks for help.
NatWest launched a 1 million pound fund in June to provide financial lifelines to victims without the means to rebuild their lives. This will make grants to cover the costs of food and household bills.
More than a dozen companies have approached SafeLives for advice and help in devising support packages since March.
""People have had a number of lights turned on about what it might mean to have a duty of care to staff when they are not in a typical workspace,"" SafeLives' Jacob said. 
NatWest's Customer Protection Manager Kim Chambers said her team provided support to 325 people in the second quarter, with 70% saying their abusers had used money to control them.
 Barclays  (L:BARC), HSBC (L:HSBA) and insurer  Aviva  (L:AV), have trained thousands of staff to identify signs of financial abuse so they can respond better to those at risk.
Banks can now also offer to block joint accounts in dispute, remove names without both parties present and open new accounts with different sort codes to hide a victim's new location.
""Banks have a critical role to play in supporting survivors of economic abuse,"" NatWest CEO Alison Rose said.

1434,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 13, 2020 07:25AM ET</span>",How a Texas shale supplier's founders made fortunes as the firm failed,"By Liz Hampton
(Reuters) - On July 7, the board of directors at Texas fracking sand supplier Hi-Crush granted nearly $3 million in bonuses to four top executives, including $1.35 million for CEO and founder Robert Rasmus.
Five days later, the company declared bankruptcy.
The payout marked the latest in a series of board decisions that allowed the oilfield supplier's top executives and founders to rake in tens of millions of dollars as shareholders saw the stock price plummet to pennies.
The three-member independent board has since 2013 included two people with close ties to Rasmus: John Kevin Poorman, a former next-door neighbor in Illinois, according to deed records; and John Affleck-Graves, who until 2019 was the chief financial officer of the University of Notre Dame, Rasmus’ alma mater and a recipient of his donations.
Rasmus gave an undisclosed amount of money for a new 4,000-square-foot entertainment facility - dubbed the Rasmus Family Club – that opened in 2017 at Notre Dame stadium, where its storied football team plays. At same the time, Affleck-Graves served as the university's chief financial officer – and, as a Hi-Crush director, was signing off on deals that put millions of dollars in Rasmus' pocket.
Since 2014, the board has approved $640 million in company purchases of three sand mines and other assets in which Rasmus and his two co-founders each held a 12.78% stake, according to regulatory filings. The sales grossed the founders a combined $245.5 million, a windfall that came at the expense of other shareholders. 
Many investors would view Rasmus’ donation to Notre Dame as creating a conflict of interest with a board member who also served as the university’s CFO and could have benefitted from an associate’s major donation to the school, said Charles Elson, Director of the University of Delaware’s Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance.
Notre Dame declined to comment on the Rasmus donation. A university spokesman, Paul Browne, said in a statement that Affleck-Graves integrity is ""beyond reproach."" Affleck-Graves did not respond to requests for comment.
Rasmus did not comment on the sand-mine transactions, his relationships with board members, or the pre-bankruptcy executive bonuses. He said in a written statement the firm's board has always complied with ""appropriate guidance, process, good corporate governance and practices, and securities and legal regulations."" 
Reuters contacted all Hi-Crush officials, founders and directors named in this story. None responded.
The founders’ windfall from the sand-mine deals, which has not been previously reported, reflects lax corporate governance in the oil patch that has raised investors’ risk, said Ed Hirs, a veteran oil industry manager and an energy fellow at the University of Houston.  
Many investors have fled the U.S. oil-and-gas sector amid poor returns and governance concerns, pushing the industry to less than 3% of the S&P 500 index from more than 16% in 2008.
Hi-Crush has been one of the leading providers of sand for the Texas boom in fracking, a drilling method that involves blasting sand and water into shale rock to release oil. It is also one of more than 50 U.S. companies in the oil and gas industry that have declared bankruptcy amid the coronavirus pandemic, which wrecked fuel demand, according to law firm Haynes and Boone. 
But the firm’s downfall also stems from poor oversight by directors who prioritized the interests of executives over shareholders, a common problem in the U.S. shale sector, said Michael Boyd, of investment adviser Energy Income Authority. 
“Mom and pop retirees don’t consider the ramifications of poor corporate governance,” he said. “They’ve made some poor investment decisions in this space, whether it be Hi-Crush or others.”
QUESTIONABLE STOCK PURCHASES
Hi-Crush shares have fallen from more than $70 in 2014 to become nearly worthless amid heavy competition. In June 2019, Rasmus and two other executives - Chief Operating Officer Michael Oehlert, and then-Chief Financial Officer Laura Fulton - reaped a gain by purchasing company shares just days before the company announced market-moving news. Company filings show the executives bought about $300,000 in company stock, with Rasmus buying more than half that amount. Days later, Hi-Crush announced a share-buyback plan that boosted the stock by 50%.
Securities laws bar executives from trading company shares if they know of a pending announcement likely to affect the stock price. Rasmus told Reuters that he and the other executives had not been aware of the buyback plan. The purchases, he said, did not constitute insider trading because they were made a day before the board agreed to the buyback.
Jacob Frenkel - a former SEC Enforcement lawyer who is currently Securities Enforcement Practice Chair for law firm Dickinson Wright – said it was unlikely that the executives had no advanced notice of the buyback.
""Board agendas and cash-flow analyses at a New York Stock Exchange-listed company do not show up the morning of the board meeting along with bagels and danishes,"" he said.
Reuters was not able to independently confirm when the executives learned of the pending stock buyback.
EXECUTIVE WINDFALLS ON SAND-MINE SALES
Hi-Crush was founded in 2010 and went public in 2012 as a master limited partnership - a two-tiered structure that included a general partnership to manage day-to-day operations and a limited partnership of investors providing capital.
Between 2014 and 2017, the general partnership sold three sand mines for hundreds of millions of dollars to the limited partnership over a period when the market for Wisconsin sand was in decline. Rasmus and two other Hi-Crush founders, Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) Alston and James Whipkey, grossed tens of millions of dollars from the transactions because each of them held a 12.78% stake in the general partnership, according to SEC filings. 
The publicly traded limited partnership - which included all stock investors - was left with mines that are now worth a fraction of the sale prices. All the sales were approved by the company’s three directors, who are elected by the general partners, including Rasmus and the other founders. 
In April 2014, Hi-Crush's general partner sold a Wisconsin sand mine to its limited partner for $224.25 million, according to SEC filings - grossing about $30 million each for Rasmus, Alston and Whipkey. In 2015, the mine was idled for about a year because of weak market conditions. Hi-Crush’s general partner sold two more Wisconsin mines to its limited partner over the next two years for a total of more than $300 million. Hi-Crush in 2019 reported more than $215 million in writedowns on two of its mines as the market tanked. 
By late 2018, the limited partner bought out the general partner entirely in a $96 million deal that ended Hi-Crush’s MLP structure. Under the deal, the three founders were awarded about $12.3 million of newly issued Hi-Crush shares, company filings show.
The deal drew criticism from some corporate analysts who said it weakened share value for stockholders by diluting the stock. Hi-Crush shares had been trading at more than $16 in July 2018, before the deal, but ended the year at around $3.50.
STEEP PREMIUM
While Hi-Crush was shifting Wisconsin sand mines facing declining demand to its limited partners, its board in 2017 approved a $275 million purchase of 1,226 acres in the west Texas town of Kermit. The move was part of an industry rush to find sand mines closer to the oil patch to lower transportation costs, but it ultimately failed to pay off for investors or reverse the company’s declining fortunes.
Hi-Crush paid an extraordinary premium for the land at a time when larger properties in the region were selling for less than half that amount, according to a Reuters review of four other deals. The seller - Permian Basin Sand Company, an entity affiliated with Platte River Equity - had acquired the same parcel roughly two months earlier for $12 million, according to a deed, before flipping it to Hi-Crush for more than 20 times that amount. 
One of the private equity company's managers was Mark Brown, who is on the board of a Notre Dame student investment management program with Hi-Crush director Affleck-Graves. Brown said he had no relationship with Affleck-Graves and declined to comment on the sand-mine sale.
The land offered some benefits to Hi-Crush. It had guaranteed income through a sand supply contract with a major shale producer, and the company at the time touted the deal by saying it made the company the first local fracking sand producer in West Texas.

But larger properties, and their plants, went for far less. Fairmount Santrol’s land and mining facility in the same town, for example, had about three times as many sand reserves, more than twice the acreage, and a similar planned production rate, but its 40-year lease and production facility was priced at $110 million the same year.

The warning from the International Air Transport Association (IATA) came as European states are imposing or considering new restrictions in response to fresh virus outbreaks.
European passenger numbers are now expected to decline by 60% in 2020, IATA said, putting some 7 million aviation and tourism jobs at risk. In June it had predicted a 6-7 million jobs impacted, with passenger demand down more than 50%.
""It is desperately worrying to see a further decline in prospects for air travel this year,"" IATA Vice President Rafael Schvartzman said.
European flights and passenger traffic have picked up in recent weeks but still fallen short of the rebound airlines had been counting on in the crucial summer season.
Britain's reimposition of quarantine on arrivals from Spain last month dealt a heavy and symbolic blow to summer recovery hopes. New restrictions have since been introduced by countries including Norway.

The UK has also renewed quarantine for arrivals from Belgium and said it may do the same for France - which on Wednesday recorded its highest number of new COVID-19 cases since lockdown measures were eased.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are set to open marginally lower Thursday, consolidating after strong gains the previous session, with investors cautious ahead of key unemployment data and with U.S. policymakers still at loggerheads over the size and scope of the next fiscal stimulus bill.
At 7 AM ET (1100 GMT), US 500 Futures traded 3 points, or 0.1%, lower, the Dow Futures contract was down 14 points, or 0.1%, while Nasdaq 100 Futures dropped 8 points, or 0.1%.
At the close Wednesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.1% to hit a new 3-month high, while the S&P 500 index added 1.4%, just a few points below its record high close, and the NASDAQ Composite index gained 2.1%.
Doubts are mounting over whether U.S. lawmakers will strike an agreement on an additional round of fiscal stimulus to support the economy. 
Nancy Pelosi, the House speaker, on Wednesday rebuffed an overture from Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to resume negotiations, with the sides seen as being at least $2 trillion apart. 
President Donald Trump inflamed the situation Wednesday, describing the Democrats’ proposals as “ridiculous” and filled with provisions that “no one in their right mind would approve.”
Attention Thursday will switch to the release of the weekly initial unemployment claims, at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT), which are expected to show a slight improvement from the week earlier, at 1.12 million filings, compared with 1.18 million. 
Still the trend continues to be over 1 million claims, dating all the way back to March, when businesses shut down to slow the spread of Covid-19. The continuing claims numbers meanwhile show the need for additional fiscal relief.
Coronavirus cases in the U.S. increased 1.1% on Wednesday, compared with Tuesday, to 5.17 million, according to data collected by Johns Hopkins University. The increase matched the average daily gain over the past week. 
Elsewhere, earnings releases are slowing down, but after the close there will also be updates from Chinese search giant Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) and online video platform iQIYI (NASDAQ:IQ)
Oil prices edged lower Thursday, consolidating after gains the previous session on the back of U.S. government data showing a fall in inventories, giving weight to the view that fuel demand is returning despite the coronavirus pandemic.
That said, the International Energy Agency lowered its global oil demand forecasts for the first time in several months earlier Thursday, after releasing its closely-watched monthly report.
The IEA now sees global oil demand for 2020 at 91.1 million barrels per day, 140,000 barrels per day lower than its previous call, reflecting a fall of 8.1 million barrels per day year-on-year.
U.S. crude futures traded 0.1% lower at $42.66 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract fell 0.2% to $45.31. 
Elsewhere, gold futures dropped 0.2% to $1,944.60/oz, settling into a lower range after registering all-time highs above $2,000. EUR/USD traded 0.5% higher at 1.1846.

1438,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 13, 2020 06:55AM ET</span>","TUI looking at new equity, divestments to cut COVID-19 debt pile","By Sarah Young
LONDON (Reuters) - TUI (L:TUIT) (DE:TUIGn), the world's largest tourism company, said it was considering raising new equity from shareholders or selling off parts of the business to reduce debt taken on to survive the coronavirus pandemic. 
TUI, which last year took 23 million people on holiday, lost 1.1 billion euros ($1.3 billion) in the three months through June after COVID-19 halted travel, wiping out revenue and straining its balance sheet as it burned through about 550 million to 650 million euros per month. 
It secured a second credit line from the German government on Wednesday, adding to a 1.8 billion euro state-backed loan taken on in April, and while the CEO said it might not need to use the latest line, the focus is now on debt.
""A rights issue or whatever kind of measure is something we are looking at,"" Chief executive Fritz Joussen told reporters on Thursday. 
Asked how big a rights issue could be, Joussen said it was ""early days"", and he did not say which parts of the business were up for sale, although he insisted that any sales would not be distressed. 
The state loans are due to be repaid in summer 2022 and banking sources have suggested that TUI could sell all or part of its 49% stake in the Spanish hotel chain RUI Hotels & Resorts. 
With the latest German aid package, TUI said liquidity was 2.4 billion euros, giving it confidence it can make it through to 2021 even as the pandemic continues to hit travel, and as it approaches winter when holiday companies generally lose money.
TUI said that it expected normality to return by 2022 and was encouraged by bookings for summer holidays next year which were up 145%. Analysts were sceptical. 
""We think plans to reduce leverage in 2021 and reach normalised profit growth in 2022 are ambitious,"" said Jefferies (NYSE:JEF). 
The company's London-based shares fell 5% to 347 pence. The stock has lost 63% of its value in the year to date. 
TUI's quarterly underlying operating loss of 1.1 billion euros as revenues plummeted 98.5% to 72 million euros, compared with earnings before interest and tax of 102.3 million euros in the same period last year.
Bookings for this summer are down 81% from last year and Joussen said the situation was still ""fragile"". TUI's recovery was set back by new UK restrictions on travel to Spain.
The company said it was making progress with the cost cuts needed to help it withstand the crisis. It warned in May that it would need to axe 8,000 jobs and save 300 million euros a year.

Bauer died of natural causes in a hospital in the capital Manila on July 27 and was cremated, Justice Secretary Menardo Guevarra said in a statement citing official documents submitted to local investigators.
Bauer was part of an ongoing probe by the National Bureau of Investigation and the Anti-Money Laundering Council into the accounting scandal.
The Philippines became connected to the accounting saga at Wirecard AG (OTC:WCAGY) when the German firm initially claimed that a missing $2.1 billion had been kept in two Philippine banks, which the banks said was not true.
The Philippines was also linked to Wirecard through its former chief operating officer Jan Marsalek, who was recorded as entering the country on June 23 then leaving for China a day later, around the time that news of the scandal broke.
Guevarra last month said those travel records had been falsified.

Taiwan’s Pegatron, which along with larger competitor Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. makes most of the world’s iPhones, said in a statement it will acquire the rest of the device casings maker it doesn’t own, then take private a unit valued at about $1 billion.
Pegatron and Hon Hai are preparing for intensified competition from Luxshare and potentially other mainland rivals, as Beijing fosters a domestic supply chain in response to growing U.S. sanctions. The Shenzhen-based Luxshare is poised to become the first locally-based iPhone assembler after it sealed a deal in July to acquire Wistron Corp.’s Apple production plant.
“Pegatron is trying to bolster its component business to defend itself against the rise of Luxshare,” said GF Securities analyst Jeff Pu. “It may streamline some overlapping business with Casetek.”

1443,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 13, 2020 06:09AM ET</span>",Staffing Woes Put U.S. Car Industry's Remarkable Rebound at Risk,"(Bloomberg) -- On the surface, carmakers have staged a remarkable recovery toward pre-pandemic production. But within the walls of U.S. auto plants, it was incredibly challenging to pull off—and is proving difficult to sustain.
Manufacturers rushed to restart assembly lines months ago because sales stayed surprisingly buoyant in the midst of the pandemic. Several companies said they restored output completely within weeks after reopening, and the industry has avoided the nightmarish outbreaks seen at meatpacking plants. But along the way, automakers have been stretched thin by absenteeism, distancing protocols, quarantines and supply-chain constraints.
In several of America’s biggest auto-making facilities, foot traffic appears to have never gotten back to February levels, according to Orbital Insight, which collects a large, stable and nationwide sample of mobile-device location data. While some carmakers downplay the challenges they’ve been having, others acknowledge coming under serious strain in getting their factories fired back up.
The data is surprising because of just how standout a comeback the auto industry has staged. Since April, the motor-vehicle and parts sector has added 289,000 to U.S. payrolls, a more than 45% surge that dwarfs employment growth in other manufacturing categories. Cars also have been the bright spot in the Federal Reserve’s monthly report on industrial production. Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co., by contrast, continues to be plagued by scrapped orders that have had a debilitating effect on other aviation businesses, including jet-engine maker General Electric Co.
 Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp.’s factories are emblematic of the unevenness of the foot-traffic recovery across some of the industry's most important plants. Activity is picking back up at its Highlander sport-utility vehicle factory in Indiana but lagging at its facilities making trucks in Texas and Corollas in Mississippi, according to Orbital Insight’s data.
“We do not anticipate our operations to ‘return to normal’ for some time,” Toyota said in an emailed statement.
Other plants that are far from bouncing back or struggling to sustain their foot-traffic recovery include two key Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co. SUV facilities, a  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn) factory that is a key source of Mercedes-Benz vehicles globally and Kia Motors Corp.’s only U.S. manufacturing site.
Automakers caution that the number of people in their plants may not necessarily correlate with production. Foot traffic at Ford’s factories is down primarily because the company is limiting admittance to critical staff, a spokesperson said. Many suppliers that drop by in normal times have called off visits. Public tours have ceased at its full-size pickup plant in Dearborn, Michigan.
Gary Johnson, Ford's chief manufacturing and labor affairs officer, acknowledged at an Aug. 3 investor conference that automakers and their suppliers have been struggling with absenteeism. But said the company says it has been operating at close to 100% of pre-virus production levels.
For Ford and General Motors Co., the stakes involved in keeping plants cranking out vehicles—particularly pickups and SUVs—are massive. GM almost broke even in North America during the second quarter, a phenomenal feat considering the amount of time its plants were shut down during the period. But both companies count on the region in normal times for vast portions of their profits. 
At GM, production was down for eight out of 13 weeks during the quarter. The number of vehicles it shipped to retailers plummeted 62%, and U.S. inventory is a little more than half what it was a year ago. Yet Dhivya Suryadevara, the automaker’s departing chief financial officer, cautioned last month that wholesale levels will remain below normal in the second half.
“Even though production is running all-out, it is not quite back at the levels, that pre-Covid ability to run all-out,” Suryadevara said during GM’s July 29 earnings call. She is leaving the automaker to become CFO of financial-technology company Stripe.
While the Orbital Insight data suggest that foot traffic at GM’s truck factories in Michigan and Indiana hasn’t gotten back to where it was in February, the two facilities are among those that have recovered the most. Dealers are champing at the bit for Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickups—“Send me all you can get” was the message Mike Jackson, chief executive officer of retailer AutoNation Inc (NYSE:AN)., delivered on Bloomberg Television in May. 
But production may not return to normal this year because of weak demand from fleet customers—both rental companies and government agencies—and since the company is not running plants on overtime, said Jim Cain, a spokesman. GM has kept open facilities in Texas and Missouri despite calls by the UAW to shut them down over Covid-19 concerns.
Elon Musk has not brought up absenteeism specifically regarding Tesla Inc.’s lone U.S. auto assembly plant, although the CEO did allude to “a bunch of firefighting on supply chain and production issues” during the electric-car maker's July 22 earnings call.
Representatives for Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) didn’t respond to requests for comment on Orbital Insight’s data, which suggests there has been a bit of a decline in foot traffic since June at its plant in Fremont, California.
 
Orbital Insight detected a pick-up in activity around the time that Musk said he would reopen the facility regardless of a local shutdown order. By the time county authorities signed off on the company resuming production, the number of devices detected was close to the levels seen before the CEO gave in to pressure to suspend operations in March.
In a regulatory filing last month, Tesla said its ability to sustain output will depend in part on “a stable and motivated production workforce.”
BMW AG resumed the first shift at its X3, X5 and X7 SUV factory in Spartanburg, South Carolina, in early May after a five-week hiatus. It took until the end of the month for the German carmaker’s supply chain to return to full strength and enable the company to restore a second shift, said Phil DiIanni, a spokesman. All furloughed workers have been reinstated since then.
Production at the plant—its largest in the world, employing 11,000 and boasting annual capacity to make 450,000 vehicles—has approached pre-virus levels, DiIanni said, and BMW has trained staff to be able to fill in at different stations to maintain output.
Daimler (OTC:DDAIF), on the other hand, appears to have much lower foot traffic at its Mercedes GLS and GLE SUV factory in Alabama than it did in February.
While staffing levels haven’t been impacted at the plant—it had more than 4,200 employees at the end of last year—Daimler has staggered shifts to reduce personal contact as much as possible, according to a spokesperson. Those who can complete tasks at home are working remotely, and the company is limiting non-essential business visits.
Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY) described similar measures at its assembly plant for Atlas (NYSE:ATCO) SUVs and Passat sedans in Tennessee. Staffing is at normal levels and the company is actually hiring, according to Mike Tolbert, a spokesman. Office and support staff are working from home, and VW is staggering shift start times and breaks to reduce the amount of foot traffic at any one time.
Production is back to where it was pre-virus, and the company remains on schedule with an expansion of its facility for electric vehicles that will be completed by the end of this year, Tolbert said.
Honda Motor Co. has had to get creative.
As with other automakers, the Japanese company isn’t just requiring employees who test positive for Covid-19 to quarantine but also those staffers who may have come into contact with them. This has led to worker shortages and spurred the carmaker to ask some U.S. office employees to join assembly lines so it can keep up with consumer demand.
Kia also is looking to make as many of its hot-selling Telluride SUVs as it can in Georgia, but it’s had to gradually restore output due to supplier constraints.
“Absenteeism has been higher as a result of the pandemic but has not resulted in reduced production,” said Patrick Sands, a U.S.-based spokesman for the South Korean company.

LONDON (Reuters) - World stocks' return to record highs looked set to be delayed for another day on Thursday, as stalemate in U.S. stimulus talks, trade war angst in both Europe and China and the COVID-19 pandemic all reined the bulls back.
A leap from Japan's Nikkei in Asia (T) after Wall Street's S&P 500 had finished just points off its record high (N) had bolstered hopes of a breakthrough, but Europe had other ideas.
The STOXX 600 (STOXX) was on course to snap a four-day winning streak after Washington said it would maintain 15% tariffs on planes and 25% tariffs on other European goods, while tourism giant TUI (L:TUIT) sank 4% as it reported an eye-watering 1.1 billion euro loss. (EU) 
""Although people think things are getting better, there is still so much uncertainty,"" said Louise Dudley, a portfolio manager at Federated Hermes (NYSE:FHI) in London.
The global rally has seen MSCI's world index (MIWD00000PUS) rise 50% since its March lows to stand just 1.4% off its all-time high. Dudley said it still had room to run, especially with companies cutting costs and working-from-home arrangements helping high-flying tech and internet stocks.
In the currency and bond markets, normal service resumed as a decline in hopes for a compromise between Republicans and Democrats over additional stimulus for the U.S. economy pushed the dollar (=USD) down 0.3% against most of its peers. [/FRX]
A selloff in benchmark government bond markets also eased, as investors digested the biggest ever 10-year U.S. debt sale and some surprisingly strong U.S. inflation figures. 
Benchmark German 10-year government yields were down 1.2 basis points at -0.45% (DE10YT=RR). Consumer prices there, harmonised for comparability with other European countries, were confirmed down 0.5% in July from the previous month.
Traders will be watching for the U.S. initial jobless claims later in the day, with economists polled by Reuters expecting a fall.
""The volatility of yields is just a reality that we have to deal with at the moment."" said Brian Jacobsen, at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Asset Management.
Central banks like the U.S. Federal Reserve are ""not going to take the punch bowl away this time"", he said. ""In fact, they are going to wait until the party is very much over until they take it away.""
JAPAN JUMP
In Asia, Japanese stocks were the main mover, soaring 1.8% to a six-month peak (N225) on gains from chip firms. (T)
Markets are still eagerly awaiting a breakthrough in wrangling over the next U.S. stimulus package, though with little sign of progress the euro (EUR=) poked back above $1.18 and Turkey's troubled lira  was able to grab some respite. [EMRG/FRX]
The Australian dollar  nudged ahead too after better-than-expected jobs figures - though the fact that unemployment topped a million for the first time ever capped gains. 
Australia was also the outlier in regional equity markets, with selling of communications giant Telstra (AX:TLS) after a profit plunge dragging on the index (AXJO).
Korea's Kospi (KS11) led gains in other markets outside Japan, rising 0.7% to a two-year high, while in commodities, oil mostly clung to solid gains made overnight when a drop in U.S. crude inventories spurred hopes that fuel demand is recovering. [O/R]
Brent crude futures (LCOc1) were last 0.2% softer at $45.33 a barrel which was roughly where it was before COVID-19 began to spread out of Asia, while U.S. crude (CLc1) dipped by the same margin to $42.60 a barrel.

""People are looking at the glass half full, and testing the waters,"" said Bank of Singapore currency analyst Moh Siong Sim.

FRANKFURT/DUESSELDORF (Reuters) - Conglomerate Thyssenkrupp (DE:TKAG) on Thursday said its steel unit faced operating losses of 1 billion euros ($1.2 billion) this year, raising pressure on it to fix or sell the division.
Shares in Thyssenkrupp, which this year sold its elevator unit to a private equity consortium for 17.2 billion euros, fell by 16.2% on the news, with analysts pointing to the weak outlook.
The expected loss at Thyssenkrupp Steel Europe, the continent's No.2 player after ArcelorMittal (AS:MT), comes as the sector suffers from cheap Chinese imports, high raw material prices and weak automotive demand.
The group has outlined plans that could see the division sold, kept or combined with a peer, with India's  Tata Steel  (NS:TISC), Sweden's SSAB (ST:SSABa) and Germany's  Salzgitter  (DE:SZGG) all considered potential partners.
Chief Financial Officer Klaus Keysberg would not be drawn on consolidation efforts, reiterating only that all options were open.
""No steelmaker is making a profit at the moment. But in terms of performance, we're certainly lagging the competition,"" he told journalists during a call, adding the company was in talks about additional job cuts.
The unit, which employs nearly 28,000, has annual personnel costs of 2 billion euros.
Thyssenkrupp said its fiscal third-quarter adjusted operating loss from continuing operations, which strips out the elevator operations, came in at 679 million euros, less than the up to 1 billion it had flagged in May.
""We have worked hard to keep our costs under control and secure liquidity,"" CEO Martina Merz said. ""As a result we came through the crisis slightly better than initially feared in the third quarter overall.""
The company said most businesses were stabilising or even improving in the quarter to September compared with the previous three months, suggesting it has passed the worst of the coronavirus crisis impact.

A DoorDash spokesman said the company felt the effort was ill-timed and that its internal data suggested the majority of its workers wanted to remain as contractors.

""We are seeking an immediate end to DoorDash's illegal behavior of failing to provide delivery workers with basic workplace protections,"" Boudin said.
""All three branches of California's government have already made clear that these workers are employees under California law and entitled to these important safeguards"", the statement added.
A California judge on Monday granted the state's request for a preliminary injunction blocking Uber and Lyft from classifying their drivers as independent contractors rather than employees.

KE, also known as Beike Zhaofang sold 106 million American depositary shares for $20 each, according to a statement. The company had marketed the shares for $17 to $19 apiece.
The offering is the largest by a Chinese company in the U.S. since iQiyi Inc. raised $2.4 billion in March 2018, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
KE is valued in the IPO at $22.5 billion based on the outstanding shares listed in its filings, marking a success for SoftBank which invested $1.3 billion at a $10 billion valuation. The company was last valued at about $14 billion in 2019, according to CBInsights data.
Despite worsening tensions between the world’s two largest economies and an accounting scandal at a U.S.-listed Chinese startup earlier this year, firms from the Asian nation have received a warm reception from U.S. investors. Chinese electric-vehicle startup Li Auto Inc. last month raised $1.1 billion in a U.S. IPO that was also priced above its range.
Beijing Homelink Real Estate Brokerage Co., also known as Lianjia, is one of China’s biggest real estate firms. It launched Beike, which means shells in Chinese, in 2018 as its online platform for property brokerage. Beike raised about $800 million from Tencent in a funding round last year. China Renaissance Holdings Ltd. invested at least $860 million in the company as well, said one of the people.
 Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS).,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), China Renaissance and JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co. are leading the offering. The shares are expected to begin trading Thursday on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol BEKE.

1448,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 13, 2020 05:28AM ET</span>","StockBeat: Tui, the Systemically-Relevant Package Tour Company","By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- After its massive bailout of Lufthansa, the German government is moving ever closer to taking a stake in Tui (DE:TUIGn), the world’s largest tourism company, evidently panicked by the inability of another big employer to support itself through the crisis.
The latest injection of state money enabled Tui to present a quarterly report on Thursday that still talked of a year of transition to a rosy future by 2022. But the reality is that without the support, the company would be unviable, and another 70,000 people would be hitting the jobless rolls sooner rather than later.
Berlin is injecting a total of 1.2 billion euros ($1.42 billion) into the group, only four months after lending it an initial 1.8 billion euros. Of that, 150 million euros is in the form of a bond that the government can convert into a stake of 9% in the group. A further cash call on current investors also seems possible, after the group said Thursday that it will “evaluate options to achieve the optimal balance sheet structure to support the business over the longer term.”
The package just about covers the 1.1 billion euros that Tui lost before earnings and taxes in the three months through June, the third quarter of its fiscal year. Revenue fell 98% (sic) as customers across Europe were forced to cancel their vacation plans. To add insult to injury, the company also lost 189 million euros on fuel and foreign exchange hedges. 
After that, surely, the only way is up, at least in the short term. As of today, it has total liquidity and available facilities of 2.4 billion euros. The existential risk to Tui’s business is – if not quite banished – then at least deferred. And bookings for next year are 145% up on year-earlier levels, a sign that the desire for holidays is still very much alive.
It will, however, be interesting to see whether the group hits its target of a cash breakeven in the current quarter, given the uneven progress in reopening Europe’s economy in time for the summer tourism season. Bookings are down 81% and average selling prices down 10%. Its cruise ships are still anchored and many of its planes are still grounded. Only this week, Tui had to expand its suspension of U.K. flights to Spain to include the Canary and Balearic Islands due the resurgence in Covid-19 cases, having already stopped flights to mainland Spain.
CEO Fritz Joussen said in the company’s release that he’s targeting a “transitional” fiscal year starting in October, with a return to a new, leaner normal in fiscal 2022. He told German state television on Wednesday that “the business model is still intact.”
Well yes, if your model can confidently assume over 3 billion euros of government aid and the likelihood of more good money being thrown after bad to space out the likely job losses. The 8,000 already announced are certainly not the last.
Tui shares, which hit a one-month high on the back of the rescue announcement on Wednesday, fell 5.1% on Thursday as the scale of its financial challenges became evident. The DAX fell 0.1% but remained close to its pre-pandemic high."

In an interview with South Korean newspaper Chosun Ilbo published on Sunday, Trevor Milton, founder of  Nikola Corp , said he would like to cooperate with Hyundai. He said he had twice made proposals to Hyundai that were rejected.
Hyundai, along with Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203), are among the few automakers championing hydrogen technology. 
""Trevor has immense respect for Hyundai and views Hyundai amongst the leaders in hydrogen around the world,"" Nikola spokeswoman Nicole Rose said in an emailed statement to Reuters.
""Trevor has, and will continue to be, open to collaborate if they ever choose to do so,"" Rose said. She did not address queries on whether Nikola had made proposals to Hyundai.
A person familiar with Hyundai said that there were no current cooperation talks. ""If Nikola makes an official offer, Hyundai can consider the proposal,"" the person said.
He said Hyundai wants to sell its hydrogen systems to other automakers but, at the same time, Nikola could become a potential competitor to Hyundai's commercial truck business. 
""It would be a complicated relationship,"" he said, declining to be identified because he is not authorised to speak to the media.
Hyundai declined to comment.
Kim Joon-sung, an analyst at Meritz Securities in Seoul, said it was uncertain whether any partnership would bring benefits to Hyundai at this point.
""Nikola needs to produce some tangible results to work with Hyundai on fuel cell cars or infrastructure, but those are not certain at this point,"" he said. 
In July, Hyundai Motor shipped the first 10 of its Hyundai XCIENT Fuel Cell, the world's first mass-produced fuel cell heavy-duty truck, to Switzerland, and aims to roll out 1,600 units by 2025. 
Nikola has said it plans to start producing its battery electric trucks in 2021, followed by fuel cell electric trucks in 2023. 

Hyundai has partnered with Audi (DE:NSUG) on hydrogen vehicle technology.

(Reuters) - European stocks fell on Thursday as simmering tensions between the United States and China, and elusive U.S. fiscal stimulus, pushed investors to book profits after four straight sessions of gains, while Airbus dipped as Washington left aircraft tariffs unchanged.
The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) was off 0.4%, with Airbus (PA:AIR) sliding 1.2% after the U.S. government said it would maintain 15% tariffs on planes and 25% tariffs on other European goods, despite moves to resolve a long-standing dispute over aircraft subsidies.

""There's not a lot negative sentiment (and) the market is fairly confident that a U.S. stimulus deal will be reached even if it's a last minute one.""
U.S. Democrats and Republicans remain deadlocked after weeks of wrangling over a fifth coronavirus aid bill. President Donald Trump on Wednesday accused congressional Democrats of not wanting to negotiate because he was refusing to go along with ""ridiculous"" spending requests unrelated to the pandemic.
In Europe, the STOXX 600 is still about 14% below its all-time high as data points to a slower-than-expected rebound from the pandemic. A survey on Thursday showed German companies expect business to return to normal in an average of 11 months, with the number even higher for firms in the services sector.
Struggling conglomerate Thyssenkrupp (DE:TKAG) plunged 13.1% after it said its steel unit would rack up 1 billion euros ($1.2 billion) in operating losses this year, raising pressure to fix or sell the division. The stock is on course for its biggest one-day decline in three months.
Danish brewer Carlsberg (CO:CARLb) slid 4.7% on warning that lockdowns will impact sales in the second half of the year in its key markets of China and Western Europe.

Elsewhere, France's unemployment rate fell to 7.1% in the second quarter, from 7.8% the previous quarter, much better than the jump to 8.3% expected. However, that 's largely because many unemployed are only counted as such if they are actively looking for work, which was impossible for most of the quarter.

1457,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 13, 2020 02:25AM ET</span>",Exclusive: China pushes First Capital merger in drive to take on Wall Street,"By Julie Zhu
HONG KONG (Reuters) - China plans to merge domestic broker First Capital Securities (SZ:002797) with smaller rival Capital Securities, three sources said, underscoring Beijing's determination to consolidate the brokerage industry to take on the giants of Wall Street. 
China wants to level the playing field as it opens up its financial markets to foreign players including Goldman Sachs (N:GS) and  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS), said two of the sources with knowledge of the matter. 
In addition to consolidation, China wants to build firms mighty enough to take on Wall Street behemoths in the domestic industry, which is worth 8 trillion yuan ($1.2 trillion) and has over 130 firms.
The merger strategy is being encouraged by the China Securities Regulatory Commission, the top securities regulator, the state-run China Securities Journal reported last month.
Shenzhen-listed First Capital, with a market value of $6.2 billion, plans to issue new shares to private Capital Securities in a deal valuing the smaller firm at about $1.4 billion, said one source, speaking on condition of anonymity as the information was private.
The merger of the two firms - ranked 44th and 62nd respectively by operating revenue last year - could be finalised as early as this year, the source added. 
Shares in First Capital surged by the maximum 10% on the news on Thursday to their highest level since Aug. 6. 
The Beijing municipal government owns 23% of First Capital and 91.5% of Capital Securities via several companies, the corporate registry showed. 
Capital Securities had been preparing for a domestic listing for months but had slowed down the process to prioritise the potential merger, said another source. 
First Capital, Capital Securities, the Beijing government and the Beijing office of the state asset regulator did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 
The potential tie-up comes as China's largest broker,  Citic  Securities (SS:600030), is in the process of merging with smaller peer China Securities Co (HK:6066), said the other two sources. Both companies have previously dismissed media reports on the merger. 
Until now, no other brokerages have been publicly named as merger candidates, and talk of a merger between First Capital and Capital Securities indicates that the consolidation strategy is gathering pace.
Citic Securities and CSC did not respond to requests for comment.
Wall Street firms are jostling for a greater share of the Chinese market after Beijing promised to scrap foreign ownership caps on securities firms and mutual funds for foreign investors from April, in an interim Sino-U.S. trade deal signed in January.

Investment banks including Goldman which already hold majority stakes in their China securities business are seeking to move towards 100% ownership and expand operations.

This contrasted with signs in the U.S. Wednesday of the pace of inflation gathering speed, pointing to economic recovery.
""The 0.6% month-on-month increase in July core CPI was jaw dropping,"" Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) said in a note. ""It was the largest sequential jump since January 1991. While this momentum in pricing is unlikely to be sustained, the strength was broad-based and cannot be ignored.""

1460,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 13, 2020 01:40AM ET</span>",European battery makers power up for a green recovery,"By Kate Abnett, Matthew Green and Norihiko Shirouzu
August 13 (Reuters) - European battery makers are gearing up to take advantage of massive ""green"" stimulus packages unveiled since the coronavirus pandemic though many acknowledge it will be tough to match the Asian giants that dominate the mainstream market.
While Sweden's Northvolt, and more recently France's Verkor, are making a play for large-scale production, other European companies are focusing on niche markets and new technologies rather than taking on Chinese and South Korean firms with mass production of batteries destined for electric vehicles (EVs).
From Greek battery maker Sunlight to start-ups like InoBat Auto in Slovakia and Switzerland's Innolith, firms say the challenge of building economies of scale fast to compete head on means finding niches is a more likely path to success, for now.
""Having battery giants in Europe, it's still possible,"" said Sunlight Chief Executive Lampros Bisalas. ""We just need to run and catch up and innovate faster than the others.""
Sunlight's Greek factory is the world's largest producer of lead-acid batteries for automated guided vehicles, forklifts and energy storage systems and it is now shifting to lithium cells.
But Bisalas isn't going after the EV market dominated by China's Contemporary Amperex Technology (CATL) (SZ:300750), Japan's Panasonic (T:6752) and South Korea's LG Chem (KS:051910), Samsung (KS:005930) SDI (KS:006400) and  SK Innovation  (KS:096770).
He's focusing on lithium-iron-phosphate (LFP) production, a type of battery suited to forklifts, locomotives and robots that perform short tasks with breaks in between.
""These markets are billions of dollars,"" said Bisalas. ""We see a very big opportunity there, because we see lithium ion producers, especially from China, being focused on EVs.""
Ever since it launched the European Battery Alliance in 2017, Europe has been pushing local firms to develop an industry that should flourish in a low-carbon future and ensure the continent is not reliant on imported products - or technology.
'SOVEREIGNTY CRISIS'
Now, China hosts 80% of the world's lithium-ion cell production – the type of battery expected to power the fast-growing EV industry – and most of the capacity coming online in Europe over the next five years belongs to Asian firms. 
But the European Union has committed 550 billion euros ($647 billion) to climate protection and clean technologies over the next seven years, and these plans hinge on batteries to store renewable energy - and to power EVs.
Researchers have already identified 13 European battery projects that could be eligible for EU support, in countries including France, Germany, Slovakia and Poland - though some are being driven by Asian manufacturers, such as LG Chem's plans to expand its factory in Krakow. 
European EV production is expected to increase six-fold in the next five years and EU leaders expect the battery value chain - from mining to production to recycling - will be worth 250 billion euros by 2025.
But some European startups concede they can't catch up with the large-scale, low-cost Asian incumbents.
InoBat Auto, for example, a Slovak startup backed by U.S. energy technology company Wildcat Discovery (NASDAQ:DISCA) Technologies and Czech utility CEZ (PR:CEZP), is instead heading into the fast lane.
Chief Executive Marian Bocek said the European auto industry's reliance on imported mass-produced batteries has created a ""technological sovereignty crisis"", forcing manufacturers to design cars around the batteries.
So it is planning to tailor batteries for high-performance vehicles that may need something special.
It plans to bring a 100 MWh (megawatt/hour) production line online next year in Slovakia near  Peugeot  (PA:PEUP), Kia Motors (KS:000270) and Jaguar Land Rover's plants - which it said could eventually become a 10 GWh (gigawatt/hour) facility. 
There, InoBat will test battery chemistries and make prototypes tweaked to each carmaker's needs.
""Our focus is more on a sort of niche, on-demand battery segment for high-performance vehicles that cannot go to the LG Chems or SK Innovations of the world,"" Bocek said.
COMPETITIVE EDGE
Analysts say the next generation of batteries must last longer, charge faster and be safer and greener than those on the market now, and that gives European companies a chance.
""That is how Europe can conceive a competitive edge over China,"" said Wood Mackenzie energy storage analyst Mitalee Gupta. ""It will get competitive pretty quickly.""
Swiss battery technology company Innolith, for one, is looking for an edge with new technologies. 
The company, which bought U.S. battery producer Alevo's intellectual property after its bankruptcy in 2017, said its labs in Germany will have prototypes this year for an NMC 811 cell that will deliver up to 315 Wh/kg (watt hour per kg).
NMC 811 cells include less cobalt than most mainstream EV batteries, which means they have the potential to deliver more power and with cheaper components.
""We cannot just take the same technology which is used, for example, in China or South Korea and copy-paste,"" said Chief Executive Konstantin Solodovnikov.
In Austria, battery technology company Kreisel Electric said it has licensed its NMC 811 technology to a European-based battery producer, which it declined to name. It already licenses its technology to Vietnamese EV maker VinFast.
Kreisel said it uses an immersion liquid cooling system to solve the fire hazards associated with lithium-ion cells in large industrial applications, giving it an edge over rivals.
'EXTREMELY IMPRESSIVE'
But while European firms look for ways into the market, Asian rivals are building more capacity on the continent.
The first European factories for SK Innovation and CATL are under construction while LG Chem already makes batteries in Poland and Samsung has a plant in Hungary.
""We can bring to Europe our advantages in cost and product quality and service,"" said Susan Zeng, co-president of CATL's European division, which plans to start production in Germany next year.
For now, Northvolt is the only European startup that looks like it will have the scale to take on the Asian giants in its backyard - and its first factory has yet to start production.
Northvolt wants 25% of Europe's battery market within a decade, a goal it says will require 150 GWh of production, more than three times the continent's current lithium-ion capacity. 
It raised $1.6 billion in debt financing last month, on top of more than 1 billion euros from backers including the world's biggest carmaker, Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS).
Northvolt's first 40 GWh plant is due to open in Sweden next year. A joint venture with Volkswagen in Germany will follow in 2024 with a potential capacity of 24 GWh and Northvolt has already struck deals to sell production worth 13 billion euros.
""In this market you have to offer scale,"" said chief environmental officer Emma Nehrenheim. 
Julian Jansen, head of energy storage research at IHS Markit, said Northvolt's launch had been extremely impressive. ""They're doing it at a speed which has probably caught a lot of people by surprise, and which no one else has been able to do.""
Verkor, a French startup whose backers include electrical equipment company Schneider Electric (PA:SCHN), said Northvolt had shown that European companies could scale up quickly to compete with mainstream rivals.
Verkor plans to build a 16 GWh lithium-ion battery factory in southern Europe by 2023 and Chief Executive Benoit Lemaignan said it would seek 1.6 billion euros next year from private equity firms and public investment banks.
While the project was conceived before the pandemic struck, Lemaignan said the EU's ""green"" post-pandemic stimulus package was accelerating its plans.

""It's just pushing us even harder and even faster, because it's exactly what is needed now to be developed in Europe.""

1461,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 13, 2020 12:54AM ET</span>","China’s Days as World’s Factory Are Over, IPhone Maker Says","(Bloomberg) --
A key supplier to Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). and a dozen other tech giants plans to split its supply chain between the Chinese market and the U.S., declaring that China’s time as factory to the world is finished because of the trade war.
Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. Chairman Young Liu said it’s gradually adding more capacity outside of China, the main base of production for gadgets from iPhones to Dell desktops and Nintendo Switches. The proportion outside the country is now at 30%, up from 25% last June.
That ratio will rise as the company -- known also as Foxconn -- moves more manufacturing to Southeast Asia and other regions to avoid escalating tariffs on Chinese-made goods headed to U.S. markets, Liu told reporters after his company reported financial results.
“No matter if it’s India, Southeast Asia or the Americas, there will be a manufacturing ecosystem in each,” Liu told investors on a conference call, adding that while China will still play a key role in Foxconn’s manufacturing empire, the country’s “days as the world’s factory are done.”
Foxconn said in a statement Thursday that, contrary to “inaccurate media reports,” management’s comments during the call did not refer to any specific companies, facilities or products, and were intended to reflect macroeconomic and industry trends.
Intensifying trade tensions between Washington and Beijing have pushed device manufacturers to diversify their production bases away from China, and Liu last year said that Apple’s most prized product, the iPhone, can be made outside China if needed. The two nations remain in trade talks, but Liu’s comments affirm a growing expectation that the China-centric electronics supply chain will fragment over the longer term.

The Taiwanese company reported better-than-expected net income of NT$22.9 billion ($778 million) for the quarter ended in June, a period that saw increased demand for iPads and MacBooks. Revenue was NT$1.13 trillion, but Hon Hai warned it expects its third-quarter sales will be down by double digits relative to 2019. Apple is expected to delay its iPhone launch this year.
Hon Hai is bouncing back from a record profit slump in the first quarter as production at its factories recovered and shelter-in-place orders spurred demand for home computing equipment. The pandemic likely boosted iPad and Mac sales, even as Apple store closures weighed on iPhone sales, Apple CEO Tim Cook said on July 31 after reporting quarterly revenue that crushed estimates. Apple accounts for half of Hon Hai’s sales.

Even as Apple outperformed, Hon Hai’s other customers have fared less well. Hong Kong-listed subsidiary FIH Mobile Ltd. said in its Aug. 7 earnings release that while Huawei Technologies Co.’s new phones have been popular in China, they missed expectations elsewhere following U.S. sanctions. Another key customer Xiaomi (OTC:XIACF) Corp. suffered a backlash in the Indian market amid growing tensions between China and the South Asian country. FIH lost $100 million in the first half.
Foxconn has been shaking up its traditionally China-focused operations. Hon Hai is among Apple assembly partners that plan to expand operations in India, potentially helping the iPhone maker grow its presence in the country of 1.3 billion and shift some of the U.S. company’s supply chain outside of China as ties between Washington and Beijing fray.
Chinese rivals are also posing a growing challenge. Local electronics titan Luxshare Precision Industry Co. is poised to become the first Chinese homegrown iPhone assembler after sealing a deal in July to buy an Apple handset production plant from Wistron Corp. While Hon Hai will keep assembly orders for premium iPhones, Luxshare will eat into the business for mid-to-entry-level Apple handsets, Fubon Securities analyst Arthur Liao wrote in a July 23 note.
Foxconn will work on its component business to maintain tech leadership and it also benefits from its long-term relationship with Apple, Liu said in response to several analysts’ questions about Foxconn’s competitive strategy against the rising Chinese supplier.
Orders could be further affected after President Donald Trump issued an executive order barring U.S. residents from doing business with Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) Ltd.’s WeChat. Annual iPhone shipments could plunge 25%-30% if Apple is forced to remove the app from its app stores worldwide, TF International Securities analyst Kuo Ming-chi warned in an August 9 note.

Investing.com - CanSino Biologics Inc. (HK:6185) saw a great start to its new listing on the Shanghai STAR Market on Thursday, with shares soaring 124.1% earlier in the day. Shares were priced at CNY385.4 ($0.74870) as of 12:30 AM ET (5:30 AM GMT).
The Chinese company raised CNY5.2 billion ($748.70 million) after floating 24.8 million shares, in China’s second most expensive initial public offering of the year to date. The 4.56 million shares allocated to public investors were oversubscribed by nearly 3,000 times.
But some analysts see the company’s jump in share price as just an overhype due to the new listing.
“The strong first-day performance reflected enthusiasm among mainland equity investors in the promising vaccine developer,” Zhou Ling, a fund manager with Shanghai Shiva Investment, said.
“It was not a surprise since nearly all companies chalk up stellar gains on the first day of trading.”
Meanwhile, the company’s Hong Kong shares were down 4.96% to HK$197.50 ($25.4808) by 12:37 AM ET (5:37 AM GMT).
CanSino Biologics is the first Chinese company to conduct human trials for the COVID-19 vaccine and expects to start phase three trials soon for its vaccine candidate Ad5-nCov, which it is co-developing with a research unit of the Chinese military.
Meanwhile, Russia announced on Wednesday that the first batch of its COVID-19 vaccine Sputnik-V would be ready for some medics within two weeks.  But there are growing concerns from scientists around the world due to the lack of data on the Russian vaccine, and the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Tuesday that it would look into the vaccine."

The positive sample appears to have been taken from the surface of the meat, while previously reported positive cases from other Chinese cities have been from the surface of packaging on imported frozen seafood.
The chicken came from an Aurora Alimentos plant in the southern state of Santa Catarina, according to a registration number given in the statement.
Virus tests of people who have possibly come into contact with the product, and tests of related products, all came back negative, the statement said. Consumers should be cautious when buying imported frozen foods and aquatic products, the government added.
Three packaging samples of imported frozen seafood tested positive for Covid-19 in Yantai, a northern city of China’s Shandong province, the city government said on its official Weibo (NASDAQ:WB) account on Tuesday. State television on Wednesday reported that the outside of an Ecuador frozen shrimp package tested positive for the virus in a restaurant in Wuhu, a city in China’s Anhui province.

Investing.com – Asian stocks were mostly up on Thursday morning, driven by optimism that the global economy is slowly but surely recovering from the impact of COVID-19.
“The main force that’s been driving markets the last few weeks has really been momentum,” Kevin Caron, portfolio manager for Washington Crossing, told Bloomberg.
“We’ve got a market that’s focused on the good case outcome for the virus, we’ve got a market that has taken a great deal of comfort in that fiscal policy is going to be there to support an economy through tough times.”
But gains in the region were capped by the ever-growing number of COVID-19 cases globally, with over 20.5 million cases as of August 13, according to Johns Hopkins University data. Investor sentiment was also muted as the U.S. Congress failed to reach consensus on the latest stimulus measures after a fifth day of negotiations.

1467,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 12, 2020 10:20PM ET</span>",U.S. leaves tariffs on Airbus aircraft unchanged at 15%,"By Andrea Shalal and David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. government on Wednesday said it would maintain 15% tariffs on Airbus aircraft and 25% tariffs on other European goods, despite moves by the European Union to resolve a 16-year-old dispute over aircraft subsidies.
U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer (USTR) said the EU had not taken actions necessary to come into compliance with World Trade Organization decisions, and Washington would initiate a new process to try to reach a long-term solution.
USTR said it would modify its list of $7.5 billion of affected European products to remove certain goods from Greece and Britain and add an equivalent amount from Germany and France.
It ignored calls from EU officials and U.S. lawmakers to drop tariffs on EU food, wine and spirits, but did not add tariffs to vodka, gin and beer as it had threatened.
Airbus said it ""profoundly regrets"" the U.S. decision to keep tariffs in place on its aircraft. 
Washington's decision to refrain from increasing the tariff rates would help prevent a further escalation, an EU official said, calling for intensified efforts to resolve trade conflicts between the powerful economic blocs.
EU trade commissioner Phil Hogan would continue his active engagement with Lighthizer to reach a negotiated settlement, the official said, noting that the current economic slowdown underscored the urgency of ending the conflict.
Last month, Airbus said it would increase loan repayments to France and Spain in a ""final"" bid to reverse U.S. tariffs and jog the United States into settling the long-running fight over billions of dollars of aircraft subsidies.
The United States declared itself in full compliance with WTO findings in May after Washington state abolished aerospace industry tax breaks that largely benefited Boeing (NYSE:BA).
Trade groups are bracing for an escalation of the row in the autumn when the EU is expected to win WTO approval to hit back with its own tariffs over subsidies for Boeing.
Airbus said in a statement it ""trusts that Europe will respond appropriately to defend its interests and the interests of all the European companies and sectors, including Airbus, targeted by these tariffs.""
Boeing urged the EU and Airbus to launch prompt and ""meaningful negotiations with the U.S. to address the full scope of their noncompliance and finally bring this case to an end.""
USTR in October 2019 imposed 25% tariffs on an array of EU food, wine and spirits, including Italian cheese and single-malt Scotch whisky in retaliation for EU subsidies on large aircraft.

It initially imposed 10% tariffs on Airbus aircraft but hiked that to 15% in March.

Health Director-General Ashley Bloomfield told reporters in Wellington on Thursday that he expects the covid cluster to increase.
The nation also reported a case from an overseas arrival on Thursday, and now has 36 active cases. All confirmed cases will be quarantined.
New Zealand latest outbreak has thrown the largest city Auckland back into lockdown and threatens to dent the economic recovery.
The country’s run of 102 days without community transmission ended this week with the announcement that four new cases had been detected in an Auckland household. A further four probable cases were identified Wednesday. Authorities are trying to stop the virus spreading to avoid the fate of nations like Australia, Japan and Vietnam, which after early successes in containing Covid-19 are now battling its resurgence.
Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has put Auckland, a city of 1.6 million people, into lockdown for an initial period of three days as health officials try to trace the origin of the infections. Social distancing rules and limits on gatherings have also been reimposed on the rest of the country.
“I know this disruption to businesses is putting extraordinary pressure on you, but the best long-term economic response is for us to get this immediate response right,” Ardern said on Thursday.
While Ardern said it was heartening that so far the outbreak was restricted to one cluster, she warned New Zealanders that the numbers would worsen.
Health authorities are investigating whether the outbreak may have originated at a cold storage firm where one of the infected people worked.

1469,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 12, 2020 07:50PM ET</span>",China's debt collectors flourish as consumers flounder in a COVID-hit economy,"By Samuel Shen, Cheng Leng and Ryan Woo
SHANGHAI/BEIJING (Reuters) - It's not a good sign for any economy when debt collectors are booming and in China right now, the industry is on a hiring spree.
Whole Scene Asset Management, a debt recovery firm based in the southern province of Hunan, plans to double staff numbers to 400 people this year as it expands into new cities.
""Debt collection companies have been mushrooming,"" said company founder Zhang Haiyan. ""And with bad loans growing this year, everyone is adding new hands.""
Rival Bricsman is also hiring - hoping to boost headcount of around 1,000 by 400-500 this year after landing a deal to collect delinquent consumer loans for China  Minsheng Bank  (SS:600016), people with knowledge of the matter said, declining to identified as they were not authorised to talk to media.
Bricsman, which is based in the eastern province of Jiangsu and counts other large banks amongst its clients, did not respond to a request for comment.
As increasing numbers of consumers struggle with lost income in an economy battered by the coronavirus and U.S-China tensions, a burgeoning wave of non-performing loans is sparking concern among lenders - both at specialist consumer financing firms and traditional banks - and even among debt collectors.
China is the midst of ""an unfolding debt crisis"", says Joe Zhang, a business consultant and until last month vice chairman at the country's largest debt collector YX Asset Recovery.
The delinquency rate for consumer debt is climbing and collecting on those loans has become much harder, he added, estimating that at some weaker non-bank consumer lenders, soured loans may account for 30% to 50% of their portfolios. 
That bodes ill not only for Beijing's efforts to spur domestic demand but also for the financial health of consumer lending firms which help provide credit seen as vital for shoring up the pandemic-hit economy.
STRATEGY RETHINK 
The China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission did not respond to a Reuters request for comment on its current assessment of risks posed by soured consumer loans.
It last said delinquency rates were under control when it noted a 0.13 percentage point rise in the non-performing loan ratio for first-quarter consumer debt compared to the start of this year. But that data only captures bank loans and not those extended by the country's vast numbers of specialist consumer finance firms including micro lenders.
Even at banks, which generally have stricter loan criteria, concern is building.
An internal review by  Bank of Shanghai Co Ltd  (SS:601229) saw its non-performing loan ratio for consumer debt soar in the first quarter, said a company source familiar with the matter.
""We've already started to reduce our exposure in consumer finance by cutting our co-lending business with smaller platforms,"" said the source, who like other lending sources was not authorised to speak to media and declined to be named.
Bank of Shanghai did not respond to a request for comment.
Chinese consumer debt has ballooned over the past five years, fuelled in part as banks scrambled to issue credit cards, with outstanding debt for bank-issued cards doubling to 17.6 trillion yuan ($2.5 trillion). 
Internet-based consumer financing, which is only lightly regulated, has also grown - by a dizzying 400 times to nearly 8 trillion yuan since 2014, according to the Guanghua School of Management. 
And Chinese household debt - including mortgages and unsecured consumer loans - has swollen to levels equivalent to nearly 60% of GDP, up from 18% in 2008, the peak of the global financial crisis.
Like Bank of Shanghai, some lenders are rethinking their retail strategy.
China  Merchants Bank  (SS:600036), which derives about 55% of its business from individual clients, is reviewing an earlier plan to increase that portion of its business to 60%, its president Tian Huiyu said in April after its first-quarter earnings. 
Shanghai ShangCheng Consumer Finance has lifted its thresholds for new borrowings while intensifying debt recovery efforts, a company manager told Reuters.
Shanghai ShangCheng did not respond to requests for comment.
""Most licensed non-bank consumer finance firms in China lost money in the first half,"" the manager said, adding that many smaller firms will ""need capital injections to keep afloat or they will face liquidity pressure when they write off huge amounts of soured debt.""

SM Prime Holdings Inc., the nation’s biggest landlord, is leasing out some of its parking lots for longer-term car storage, while a unit of Ayala Land Inc. plans to convert areas in its shopping centers to e-commerce backend facilities and medical clinics.
Southeast Asia’s worst coronavirus outbreak has made Filipinos fearful of going about their daily business and they’re seeking to avoid high-traffic spots. That’s putting extra pressure on retail landlords already weathering slump in demand and a recession.
The Philippines is home to some of Asia’s biggest malls; capital Manila and surrounds boast total retail space of 7.3 million square meters, according to Joey Bondoc, a research manager at Colliers International Group (NASDAQ:CIGI) Inc. That’s more than twice the size of New York’s Central Park.
Retail vacancy rates in Manila are forecast to climb to 12% this year while rents will drop for the first time since the global financial crisis, forcing shopping centers to either “innovate or evaporate,” Bondoc said.

AyalaLand Logistics Holdings Corp. is studying turning parts of its malls into last-mile fulfillment facilities, according to a document seen by Bloomberg.
“We continue to explore opportunities,” said Francis Montojo, the unit’s chief finance officer. He added that other commercial areas may be converted to healthcare clinics or office space.
SM Prime, meanwhile, has leased out a floor in the car park of a shopping mall to a bank, as well as leased another floor in an office tower, President Jeffrey Lim said in a text message.
“Retail developers must look at possible areas to pivot and re-purpose space,” said Kash Salvador, an associate director at property services company Santos Knight Frank. “We see an opportunity in storage and warehousing given higher logistics demand as shoppers go online.”
Mall owners should also consider leasing vacant space to co-working companies as businesses seek smaller offices in various locations, Colliers’ Bondoc said.

On a post-earnings call, executives said the company would be forced to suspend operations in California if a preliminary injunction that prevents it from classifying drivers as independent contractors goes into effect on Aug. 21. 
Larger rival Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc has also echoed similar concerns.
Lyft said the number of active riders dropped by 60% to 8.69 million during the second quarter but added it was encouraged by the recovery trends.
""We saw a rebound in demand in Q2 and have seen further evidence of this trend since the end of Q2. Rideshare rides in July were 78% greater than April,"" Chief Executive Officer Logan Green said.
Uber last week said while its gross bookings declined 75% overall in the second quarter, bookings in some regions outside the United States exceeded pre-COVID-19 levels.
Unlike Uber, which operates in 69 countries, Lyft only offers rides in the United States and Canada. 
That region is the biggest market for both companies, but it also remains among the worst-hit by the health crisis, with business and travel at a standstill across the United States.
Lyft's quarterly revenue fell to $339.3 million, while adjusted EBITDA loss of $280.3 million was smaller than its previous projection of a loss of $325 million.
The company in April announced pay cuts and laid off nearly 1,000 employees, or 17% of its workforce, in an effort to reduce costs.

(Reuters) - Southwest Airlines Co (N:LUV) Chief Executive Gary Kelly said on Wednesday he does not expect the airline will be profitable in 2020 amid the coronavirus pandemic, snapping a 47-year streak of posting consecutive full-year profits.
""As long as the case counts are high, I think that we have to expect that travel will be relatively modest,"" Kelly said at a Texas Tribune event. ""We’re continuing to see traffic and revenues down 75% versus a year ago today and to think that would recover to the point we would be profitable I just think is unrealistic.”
The company last month posted a $915 million loss for the second quarter. Kelly said it is still burning through about $20 million a day.
""We're still losing cash every single day,"" he said. ""We've got a long way to go before we can feel like we are out of intensive care.""
Southwest's has cut its scheduled flights by about 35% to 40%, Kelly added. ""The airlines are less full,"" Kelly said, noting the airline was not booking middle seats.
Nearly 17,000 Southwest employees have agreed to voluntary long-term leaves or exit packages.
""The solution here is to get our passengers back -- not to try to shrink the airline so radically that we're prepared for a very, very modest travel environment,"" Kelly said.
Southwest shares Wednesday closed largely unchanged.
Earlier, Southwest, Ryanair Holdings Plc (I:RYA) and EasyJet Plc (L:EZJ) were the only three airlines whose bonds are still rated investment grade, S&P Global Ratings said, while estimating a drop of up to 70% in global air passenger traffic for 2020.
Carriers operating long-haul international flights including American Airlines (O:AAL), United Airlines (O:UAL) and Delta Air Lines (N:DAL) have been among the worst hit due to the pandemic.

1476,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 12, 2020 05:10PM ET</span>","United Airlines bets on Florida, adding dozens of flights a day starting November","By David Shepardson
(Reuters) - United Airlines (O:UAL) is adding up to 28 daily nonstop U.S. flights to Florida starting Nov. 6 as the Chicago-based airline bets on a rebound in leisure travelers heading to sunny skies.
The direct flights are from non United hub cities in Boston, Cleveland, Indianapolis, Milwaukee, New York/LaGuardia, Pittsburgh and Columbus, Ohio to four Florida destinations.
United said it is part of its ""continuing strategy to aggressively, and opportunistically manage the impact of COVID-19 by increasing service to destinations where customers most want to fly."" But the carrier said it could reduce the number of flights if COVID-19 infections in Florida remain high.
New Florida flights will go to Fort Lauderdale, Fort Myers, Orlando and Tampa.
Ankit Gupta, United’s vice president of domestic network planning, said the new flights represent ""United’s largest expansion of point-to-point, non-hub flying and reflects our data driven approach to add capacity where customers are telling us they want to go.""
United can adjust up or down. Gupta said the added Florida flights could amount to more than 400,000 additional seats this winter season. He said many U.S. travelers are picking Florida instead of international destinations.
There are modest signs of improving air travel demand. The Transportation Security Administration said it screened 831,789 people on Sunday -- the first time it screened more than 800,000 people since March 17. That is still down 70% over prior year figures.
Still, Florida has reported 542,792 coronavirus cases, the second most of any U.S. state behind only California, according to a Reuters tally, and more than 10% of all reported U.S. cases. If coronavirus cases in Florida remain high, ""we will adjust our plans,"" Gupta said.

Southwest Airlines (N:LUV) chief executive Gary Kelly said at a Texas Tribune forum on Wednesday the airline is still trying to figure how many flights to offer as it works to reduce its $20 million a day losses. ""It is pure guesswork at this point"" Kelly said.

Investing.com –  Lyft  on Wednesday reported second-quarter results that fell short of analysts' estimates as the pandemic brought ride-sharing activity to a halt. 
LYFT (NASDAQ:LYFT) fell 1% postmarket.
For the second quarter, Lyft narrowed losses per share to $1.41 from $2.32 reported a year earlier, while revenue fell 60.9%, to $339.3M. The results compared with consensus estimates for a loss of $1.07 a share on revenue of $340.6B.
The contribution margin decreased to 34.6% from 46.0% in the quarter, missing estimates of 48.7%.
The company said ""active riders"" on its platform slumped 60% to 8.7 million in the fourth quarter compared to the same period last year, while revenue per active rider slipped 2% year-over-year to $39.06.
Lyft, however, said it had seen signs of a recovery in ride-sharing activity.
""While rideshare rides in the quarter were down significantly year-over-year, we are encouraged by the recovery trends we are beginning to see, with monthly rideshare rides in July up 78% compared to April,"" said Logan Green, co-founder and chief executive officer of Lyft.

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Low-cost carrier JetSMART is fast-tracking its expansion plans to Peru and potentially Colombia and Brazil, its chief executive told Reuters, even as airlines, in Latin American in particular, are scaling down their fleets and ambitions.
Chile-based JetSMART is in the enviable position of having well-funded private equity backers such as Indigo Partners, which also owns stakes in Denver-based Frontier Airlines and Hungarian carrier Wizz Air (L:WIZZ), during the pandemic.
In expanding to other South American domestic markets, JetSMART will directly challenge the region's leaders, LATAM Airlines Group (SN:LTM) and Avianca Holdings (CN:AVT_p), both of which filed for bankruptcy restructuring in May due to the crisis.
JetSMART CEO Estuardo Ortiz said the pandemic has given the upstart airline an incentive to accelerate aspects of its expansion to deploy its narrowbody Airbus planes to markets with more demand.
""We had already thought about flying domestically in Peru, originally maybe in 2022, but we brought that plan forward,"" Ortiz said. ""We are now working to begin operating JetSmart Peru at the beginning of 2021, because clearly we need to bring planes to where there is demand.""
JetSMART, which has a fleet of 17 jets, had planned to fly 100 planes by 2026, but it may have to push back that goal by about two years, Ortiz said.
Avianca pulled out of Peru in May, leaving its coveted Lima-Cuzco slots up for grabs. It also fired almost 1,000 employees including pilots.
Like most industry executives, Ortiz believes domestic flights will bounce back faster than international travel. In Latin America, that means flying domestically in more countries.
""If the recovery is very slow for international travel, that means we have to accelerate our plans for new domestic operations,"" Ortiz said. ""We have watched Colombia and Brazil closely for some time.""
Reuters first reported in June that JetSMART had presented the Brazilian government with a plan for domestic flights.
Indigo Partners has been making bullish bets despite the coronavirus crisis. It tried unsuccessfully to buy Virgin Australia out of bankruptcy and has maintained firm orders with Airbus (PA:AIR) to buy more than 400 planes for its carriers.
""At the beginning of next year, we will evaluate trends and decide if we enter another country,"" Ortiz said.

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - A Brazil labor judge on Wednesday gave meat producer JBS SA (SA:JBSS3) 10 days to medically screen workers at its Garibaldi chicken plant and also pay for COVID-19 testing for every worker, according to a copy of the ruling seen by Reuters.
More than 900 people work at the plant in Rio Grande do Sul state, of which 230 have already tested positive for the novel coronavirus, prosecutors who sought the order said, citing data from local health services.
JBS was unavailable for immediate comment.
The company has dealt with COVID-19 outbreaks at plants in Brazil and in the United States. Sometimes the outbreaks led to temporary plant closures.
At Garibaldi, seven workers have been hospitalized and one died, the prosecutors told the court.
In Wednesday's ruling, Brazilian labor Judge Graciela Maffei also ordered JBS to ensure that its Garibaldi workers remain at least 2 meters (6 feet) apart at the facility's entrances and exits, during shift changes, in changing rooms and other areas of the factory such as the restaurant.
Maffei also ruled that JBS should supply and supervise use of PFF2 respirators by all employees there, including on the buses that ferry them to work.
Each worker should receive a new respirator every day, according to a copy of the ruling.

1480,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 12, 2020 04:13PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: 3 Things to Watch for August 13,"By Liz Moyer
Investing.com -- U.S. stocks flirted with new highs on Wednesday, fueled by a renewed surge in big tech and signs that inflation is gaining momentum as the economy recovers from a record-breaking slump.
The S&P 500 got within a few points of its February high, which it reached before the pandemic forced the economy to shut down. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and NASDAQ Compositealso notched triple digit point gains.
Still, there is a stalemate in Washington as neither side of the political aisle could strike a compromise on the latest round of economic stimulus, something several economists have said is needed to help sustain the recovery.
Crude Oil WTI Futures prices jumped after an unexpectedly large drop in crude inventory last week eased concerns about the fragile demand for gasoline and other energy products.
Fresh data on employment trends is expected on Thursday ahead of retail sales and other economic data on Friday.
Here are three things that could affect the markets tomorrow:
1. A fresh round of jobs data
The government is expected to release last week's initial unemployment claims at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT). The number is expected to show slight improvement from the week earlier, at 1.12 million filings, compared to 1.18 million. Still the trend continues to be over 1 million claims, dating all the way back to March, when businesses shut down to slow the spread of Covid-19.
Continuing jobless claims are also expected to be released at 8:30 AM ET, and the number is forecast to decline but remain in high. Analysts polled by Investing.com foresee 15.9 million claims, down from 16.1 million the previous week.
2. Another week for big IPOs
There are several stock debuts lined up this week, even as analysts question the valuations of technology startups.
A closely watched deal is the IPO of Duck Creek Technologies, which said Wednesday it was raising its price target to $23 to $25 a share from $19 to $21 prior.
Duck Creek provides software-as-a-service for insurance companies like American International Group Inc (NYSE:AIG), according to Seeking Alpha. The new pricing means Duck Creek could raise $360 million in the 15 million share offering, reaching a company valuation of $3.2 billion, not including the underwriter's option.
After the offering, the private equity firm Apex will hold a 34% stake, Seeking Alpha said. Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN) will hold 23%.
3. A window on how coronavirus is affecting small businesses
Cisco Systems Inc (NASDAQ:CSCO) shares fell 3.7% in after-market trading after reporting earnings of 80 cents a share versus the 74-cent EPS forecast. Revenue of $12.15 billion also beat expectations of $12.09 billion. It's the first big tech name to report a quarter that includes July, when much of the business world had emerged from coronavirus lockdowns.
Analysts see Cisco as a crucial proxy for business spending on information technology. Work-from-home mandates have benefited companies like Cisco that offer cloud data centers and video conferencing services. Raymond James analyst Simon Leopold said large enterprise sales have improved at Cisco but business from small- and medium-sized outfits showed weakness, according to MarketWatch."

The company showed some signs of recovery towards the end of the quarter, with bookings down 30% in June from a year earlier, compared with a 70% decline in May year over year, according to the report.
Airbnb declined to comment. 
The company's plans to go public, one of the highly awaited stock listings this year, come at a time when its home-rental business has been hit hard by the pandemic, which has forced millions of people to postpone their travel plans.
Airbnb is close to confidentially filing paperwork for an initial public offering (IPO) with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission later in August, a media report on Tuesday said. 
Its guests have booked more than 1 million nights globally as of July 8 and a major part of the bookings were for trips that will start on or before Aug. 7, the company said in July, adding it hit the 1 million mark for the first time since March 3.

TORONTO (Reuters) - The head of Canada's mortgage agency urged lenders to avoid offering home loans to riskier borrowers insured by its private rivals warning that excessive household borrowing will make the ""pain of the deferred COVID-19 economic adjustment worse.""
Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp (CMHC) has lost mortgage insurance market share to private insurers after the government-backed agency tightened underwriting standards from July 1 as it forecast home price declines of as much as 18% over the next 12 months.
""While we would prefer our competitors followed our lead for the good of our economy, they nevertheless remain free to offer insurance for those whom we would not,"" CMHC Chief Executive Evan Siddall said in the letter to lenders dated Aug. 10 and made public on Wednesday.
Siddall said the CMHC is approaching the minimum level it needs to protect the mortgage market during crises, and urged banks to help protect against further erosion.
""Our ability to respond effectively in a crisis will be weakened if our market share deteriorates significantly further,"" Siddall added.
Canadian home prices held up through the pandemic as listings dried up alongside buyers, and rose further in July as lower mortgage rates and the end of lockdowns caused demand to outpace an increase in homes put up for sale. But CMHC has forecast home-price declines of as much as 18% over the next year, and Siddall said in the letter he still expects prices to fall. 
""We don't think our national mortgage insurance regime should be used to help people buy homes with negative equity,"" 

Siddall said, adding that exposing borrowers, and first-time home buyers in particular, to excessive borrowing creates a very significant economic drag.

1489,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 12, 2020 01:30PM ET</span>",Explainer: How commodity trade finance works,"By Julia Payne
LONDON (Reuters) - Global banks were left shell-shocked this year by a series of commodity trader collapses after instances of fraud were laid bare by the coronavirus crisis. 
ABN Amro (AS:ABNd) on Wednesday said it would end all trade and commodity financing, shedding 800 jobs, following several other lenders who have already restructured or put their trade finance divisions under review as they scramble to recoup billions of dollars in debt.
The $21 billion liquidity hole left by the Dutch bank will be hard to fill, presenting a more uncertain future for smaller commodity traders without a strong presence in a niche market. 
Trade finance is a term covering many types of loans, typically from banks, that facilitate global movement of goods from wheat to gasoline. The loans reduce risk for counterparties and allow them to juggle multiple transactions.
Most trade finance loans are short-term, less than a year.
Commodity finance was hit hard by the 2008 financial crisis and subsequent regulation aimed at preventing similar downturns. 
WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF LOANS?
* A letter of credit (L/C) is the most common form of trade finance. A buyer's bank sends a letter to the seller's bank guaranteeing payment to the seller once goods arrive.
* Major oil and commodity trading firms make use of another type of loan called a revolving credit facility (RCF). Under an RCF, a consortium of banks allow a company to borrow up to an agreed upon maximum threshold. The company can repeatedly borrow and repay this credit, as long as it not exceed the threshold. 
* Companies that do regular business together and have built trust may forgo the guarantees provided by L/Cs and opt to use open credit instead. This does not provide protection in the event a counterparty fails to meet its obligations.
HOW DOES IT WORK?
* For example, with the loans a trader can buy five cargoes of crude oil or build a significant futures position while still waiting on payment for other crude cargoes sailing to a refinery. 
WHAT ARE THE TYPES OF STRUCTURED COMMODITY FINANCE LOANS?
* Pre-export finance: Banks provide a longer-term loan to cover the costs of production secured against the sale of future output. 

* Prepayment: This type of long-term loan is more frequently used in the oil industry than other commodities. For instance, a trading house, backed by banks or insurers, will provide upfront cash to an oil producer and gradually be repaid with physical barrels of crude. The timeframe for this type of loan is usually several years.

1491,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 12, 2020 01:27PM ET</span>",Apple’s Split Will End Dominance of Dow Average’s Top Influencer,"(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL).’s planned stock split will diminish its influence on the Dow Jones Industrial Average after the iPhone maker’s 100% surge since March lows nearly dragged the price-weighted measure back to an all-time high.
At its current price of $448 a share, Apple has the biggest weighting in the index at 11%. A 4-to-1 split now would drop its price tag to about $112 and send its ranking in the Dow Average down to 16th. Apple has rallied almost 55% in 2020, adding more than 1,000 points to a stock measure that’s fallen about 2% during that time. The split is scheduled to take effect Aug. 31.
In a world where passive investing rules the stock market, a drop of weight in indexes like the Dow Average is likely to prompt outflows from money managers who mimic benchmark changes. About $31.5 billion was either indexed or benchmarked to the gauge at the end of 2019, according to data from S&P Dow Jones Indices.
A stock split “is an appeal to retail,” said Charles Day, a UBS managing director and private wealth adviser with more than $600 million in assets under management. “It will make a difference for the Dow.”
The split, however, won’t affect Apple’s No. 1 position in the S&P 500, an index that’s weighted by market capitalization, rather than stock prices.
Apple has rallied the most in the Dow this year as locked-down consumers snapped up new iPhones, iPads and Mac computers to stay connected during the pandemic. While any selling as a result of the weighting change may pale in comparison to the company’s market value of $1.9 trillion, it’s nonetheless not good news for a stock whose relentless gains are stirring angst at a time when tech shares have lagged behind the market over the past month amid valuation concerns.
Apple’s split is “theoretically decreasing demand from passive indexers,” Julian Emanuel, chief equity & derivatives strategist at BTIG LLC, wrote in a note. “Combined with a generalized loss of momentum in the Nasdaq 100, AAPL could succumb to Newton’s Law of Gravity in the weeks ahead.”

1495,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 12, 2020 12:55PM ET</span>","Business owners can sue insurer over coronavirus losses, Missouri judge rules","By Jonathan Stempel
(Reuters) - A federal judge in Missouri said on Wednesday a group of hair salons and restaurants can sue their insurance carrier for business interruption losses caused by the coronavirus pandemic, which they say caused a ""direct physical loss"" to their premises.
The decision against Cincinnati Insurance Co by U.S. District Judge Stephen Bough in Kansas City appears to be first victory for policyholders suing insurers for improperly denying claims related to shutdowns caused by COVID-19.
Insurers had won similar earlier cases in a Michigan state court and a Washington, D.C., court, successfully arguing that coverage was not warranted because the virus travels through the air and does not cause physical damage.
While not ruling on the merits, Bough rejected Cincinnati Insurance's bid to dismiss the Missouri case.
He said the presence of COVID-19 was not a ""benign condition,"" and the plaintiffs plausibly alleged that particles were a ""physical substance"" that attached to and damaged their property, rendering them unsafe and unusable.
Cincinnati Insurance is a unit of Cincinnati Financial Corp (NASDAQ:CINF). Its lawyers did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The plaintiffs' businesses are located in Missouri and Kansas. Their lawyers also did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Business owners have filed hundreds of lawsuits claiming that their business interruption insurance, which typically offers coverage for losses from calamities such as fires or floods, should also cover a pandemic.
Insurers have countered that applying such coverage to COVID-19 losses would result in crippling payouts and deplete their capital.
Analysts have said the industry's coronavirus-related losses have so far been modest.
The Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation is considering whether to consolidate hundreds of lawsuits seeking business interruption coverage for COVID-19.
The case is Studio 417 Inc et al v Cincinnati Insurance Co, U.S. District Court, Western District of Missouri, No. 20-03127.

State and local government budgets have been severely damaged by the Covid-19 pandemic due to lost tax revenue and rapidly rising expenses, and that may have ramifications for investors, Morgan Stanley Wealth Management strategists Scott Helfstein and Monica Guerra wrote in a note Tuesday.
“Though municipal budgets are strained, muni bond yields have reached historic lows due to constructive seasonals and risk-off sentiment,” the strategists wrote. “Failure to secure aid for state and local governments presents downside risk for bonds of low credit quality at a time when investors are willing to move down the credit curve.”
A $600 enhanced weekly benefit for unemployment insurance expired at the end of July, and negotiations between Congress and the Trump Administration haven’t progressed much. President Trump announced an executive order that would offer $400 a week in jobless benefits, with states covering 25% of the cost, as one of several moves that he may lack the authority to make unilaterally.

Another area flagged by Morgan Stanley Wealth was in student loans, where deferral of principal and interest payments was automatically extended to Dec. 31 for some federal loans.
“Those with private loans get no reprieve from payment due on principal and interest,” the strategists said. “Thus, we believe that securities backed by private student loans with speculative grade credit quality and tranches with few enhancements may experience pressure.”

1499,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 12, 2020 12:16PM ET</span>","Billionaire Sumner Redstone, media mogul who headed Viacom, dead at 97","By Helen Coster
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Viacom and CBS Chairman Emeritus Sumner Redstone, the media mogul who took his father's movie theater chain and built it into an empire that included Paramount Pictures, CBS and MTV, has died at 97, ViacomCBS (NASDAQ:VIAC) and National Amusements said on Wednesday.
Redstone, as executive chairman of both Viacom Inc (O:VIA) and CBS Corp (N:CBS), had controlled the two companies through privately held National Amusements. But in his early 90s, the state of Redstone's physical and mental health set off an avalanche of corporate maneuvering over his media holdings that resulted in him stepping down in 2016 as executive chairman of both companies. 
CBS and Viacom were combined from 2000 to 2006, when Redstone separated them in an attempt to unleash the value of Viacom's cable channels.
His position as one of the world's leading media moguls had begun fading in 2015 as those close to him began questioning his mental capacity. The long-running legal battle that ensued put him at odds with a former girlfriend and long-time confidante Philippe Dauman but reunited him with his daughter Shari, from whom he had been estranged. 
Shari Redstone said in a statement: ""My father led an extraordinary life that not only shaped entertainment as we know it today, but created an incredible family legacy. Through it all, we shared a great love for one another and he was a wonderful father, grandfather and great-grandfather. I am so proud to be his daughter and I will miss him always.”
The challenges to Redstone's mental health resulted in him being replaced as executive chairman at CBS by Les Moonves and at Viacom by Dauman, whom Redstone would later drop from the trust that was to determine the direction of CBS and Viacom after his death.
After legal and backroom wrangling that one observer likened to ""Game of Thrones,"" the Redstone family ousted Dauman from Viacom in August 2016, ultimately replacing him with Robert Bakish. Dauman had been among those questioning Redstone's mental capacity and his influence had waned after Redstone's daughter, Shari, started taking a more active role in his business.
Since 2016, Shari pushed twice to merge CBS and Viacom. She's also weathered a lawsuit aimed at diluting her family's control of CBS, and a sexual misconduct scandal at CBS, which resulted in the September 2018 resignation of CEO Les Moonves. Viacom and CBS re-merged in 2019.
Shari Redstone and her son Tyler Korff will now take over two seats on a trustee board that controls the voting interest in an entity, National Amusements Inc, that holds the controlling stake in ViacomCBS, according to a source familiar with the matter.
RISK TAKER
Redstone was born on May 27, 1923, into a Boston family that owned a chain of drive-in movie theaters. He graduated first in his class at Boston Latin High School, went through Harvard in three years and worked with an elite U.S. Army unit that cracked Japanese codes during World War Two.
After the war, he earned a law degree at Harvard and successfully pleaded a case before the U.S. Supreme Court. He joined National Amusements, his family's theater chain, in 1954, and became chief executive officer in 1967.
Known for his blunt talk, Boston accent and audacious risk taking, Redstone was in his 60s in 1987 when he bought Viacom for $3.4 billion with mostly borrowed money. A few years later he acquired Paramount for more than $10 billion and added CBS to the portfolio in 1999 in a deal valued at $37 billion.
Before his health deteriorated, Redstone had claimed to swim naked every day and always liked to be surrounded by beautiful young women.
""With a striking head of orange hair, Redstone is a vainglorious, old-school egomaniac who has an operatic personal life that has been largely kept out of the media undoubtedly because he controls so much of it,"" author Michael Wolff wrote in New York magazine in 2002.
""LIVING GHOST""
After decades spent building his empire, Redstone's participation at corporate events became minimal in 2014 and he spoke only a few words on earnings calls. Fortune magazine reported he attended his last board meetings that year and cited a witness who said he dozed and drooled during it, which raised the question about whether he was fit to run the company. 
Despite the concerns about his health, Redstone hung on to his chairmanship as long as possible. In June 2015, he told Vanity Fair in an email correspondence, ""You should know that I am never retiring!!!""
Later that year, the Wall Street Journal reported Redstone had suffered mini-strokes that made speaking difficult, although he remained mentally sharp. 
Former girlfriend Manuela Herzer challenged Redstone's mental competence in a lawsuit filed in November 2015, referring to him as a ""living ghost."" 
The suit was thrown out in May 2016 by a California judge who ruled that Redstone's testimony had disproved Herzer's claims. Herzer appealed the judge's ruling, and the parties settled in 2019. 
Redstone's death, which comes at a time the media landscape is enduring wrenching changes, thins the ranks of a group of media executives, including Rupert Murdoch and Ted Turner, who changed the world of news and entertainment with the companies they built.
Redstone displayed a penchant for forcing out top executives, including Viacom President Frank Biondi; Mel Karmazin, the CEO of CBS; and Tom Freston, who was canned as CEO of Viacom after losing a deal to acquire the social media network MySpace to Murdoch.

Asked in his last interview, in January 2014, with The Hollywood Reporter, about who might succeed him, Redstone exploded, ""I will not discuss succession. You know why? I’m not going to die.""

1501,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 12, 2020 11:54AM ET</span>",Wall Street Fears This Stock Rotation Is Another False Dawn,"(Bloomberg) -- After so many disappointments for riskier stocks, Wall Street strategists should probably be forgiven for warning clients the market rotation might not last.
Between sluggish growth, U.S.-China tensions and bad omens from the bond market there are plenty of reasons a rebound in American equities most sensitive to the economy will prove unsustainable.
Yet the fact remains that a long-short strategy targeting value stocks has posted its best three days since June. The Russell 2000 Index of small-cap shares just surged to a two-month high versus the S&P 500 Index. Airlines, hotels and cruise lines -- the biggest pandemic losers -- have been outperforming the technology titans.
Stimulus and vaccine hopes are stirring these animal spirits, and they’re rekindling the great rotation debate along the way.  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). encapsulated the dilemma in a note this week: riskier industrials got an upgrade, but defensive tech shares also kept their overweight.
At JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co., they’d call recent moves a “tactical value snapback” after the valuation gap between these market laggards and their defensive counterparts reached historic levels. Alongside the likes of Sanford C. Bernstein, the bank sees no reason to expect a vigorous comeback.
“Market leadership will be growth- and defensives-driven this year, both in the selloff and in the subsequent market recovery,” JPMorgan strategists led by Mislav Matejka wrote in a note on Monday.
The team cites China’s reluctance to pump fresh stimulus into its economy, uncertainty over global trade and a conviction the dollar won’t fall much further as reasons to doubt the longevity of the rotation.
That all plays into long-standing market divisions in favor of companies expected to have strong long-term cash flows, dubbed growth stocks, versus equities that look cheap -- divisions that were severely deepened by the pandemic. Already there are signs of the divide reasserting itself, with tech beating all other sectors on Wednesday as the value strategy fell anew.
“The missing link -- what will keep U.S. small caps working -- is real cyclical recovery,” Nicholas Colas and Jessica Rabe, co-founders of DataTrek Research, wrote in a Wednesday note.

Generally speaking, value and small stocks are more tethered to the business cycle, so they tend to fare best when a steepening yield curve is signaling better economic expectations. It’s a contentious premise in some corners, but is a common rule of thumb among Wall Street strategists.
Bernstein says a sustained rebound for value stocks will require a steeper yield curve. But with yields pinned down by an ultra-dovish Federal Reserve and long-term inflation expectations relatively low, significant steepening looks a long way off.
Meanwhile, the evidence is suggesting markets remain one big macro-driven trade.
The global average correlation between stocks still hovers near the highest since at least 2000, according to Bernstein. It reckons equity factors including growth, momentum, quality and low volatility are practically trading as one, and they have a near perfect inverse correlation to value.
That’s a sign of a deeply bifurcated market teeming with big-picture risks, and one reason defensive investing styles have boomed in the pandemic.
“Market returns are a function of sector and factor exposure to a greater extent than any time since the global financial crisis,” Evercore ISI strategists led by Dennis DeBusschere wrote in a note.

(Reuters) - Shares of  Moderna  Inc (O:MRNA) rose more than 5% on Wednesday after analysts said a $1.5 billion coronavirus vaccine supply agreement with the U.S. government could lead to similar deals with other countries.
The United States and Moderna announced the agreement for 100 million doses of its potential COVID-19 vaccine late on Tuesday.
The company's vaccine candidate, mRNA-1273, is one of the few that have already advanced to the final stage of testing.
The deal confirms Moderna's experimental vaccine is one of the leading contenders, said BMO analyst George Farmer, who has an ""outperform"" rating on the stock.
With the U.S. contract now signed, other deals could follow, said Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) analyst Michael Yee, who has a ""buy"" rating. 
""We assume other countries ... will want to secure deals out of sheer responsibility before the capacity of the major 3-4 players is locked up.""
Effective vaccines and treatments are seen as essential in halting the COVID-19 pandemic, with governments also signing deals for potential vaccines from companies such as AstraZeneca (L:AZN) and  Pfizer  Inc (N:PFE).
Under the contract, Moderna will provide about 100 million doses, with the price coming to around $30.50 per person for a two dose regimen.
SVB Leerink analyst Mani Foroohar said the price was lower than deals signed by rivals and pointed to increased competition driving down prices in the coronavirus vaccine market.
The U.S. deal would pay out in full if the vaccine achieves certain regulatory milestones before Jan. 31, 2021. (https://

The vaccine, called ""Sputnik V"" in homage to the world's first satellite launched by the Soviet Union in 1957, has yet to complete its final trials and some scientists said they feared Moscow may be putting national prestige before safety.
""It seems our foreign colleagues are sensing the specific competitive advantages of the Russian drug and are trying to express opinions that in our opinion are completely groundless,"" Health Minister Mikhail Murashko said the day after President Vladimir Putin announced it had won regulatory approval.
On the streets of Moscow, some Russians said they would be too scared to try the vaccine, while others agreed with their government that scepticism expressed by foreign experts was driven by jealousy.
""I don't trust Russian vaccines in general, I definitely won't get vaccinated,"" said Ekaterina Sabadash, 36, speaking outside Moscow's Bolshoi Theatre.
Alexander, a photographer, was also wary. ""Until it goes through (final) clinical trials and we get some confirmed results, I would be scared to get it done,"" he said.
Others said they understood why Russia was in a hurry to get a new vaccine and trusted it, but doubted they would really have a say in whether to have it.
""I'm a teacher and they'll recommend we get it,"" said Irina Fashchevskaya, a Moscow resident. ""We'll be forced to do it.""
Officials have said that the vaccine, developed by Moscow's Gamaleya Institute, would be administered to people, including doctors, on a voluntary basis in the final trial. Mass roll-out in Russia is expected to start in October. 
Scientists from Germany the United States and Britain have queried the wisdom of approving the vaccine before testing is complete, saying it was risky from a safety point of view.
Kirill Dmitriev, head of Russia's RDIF sovereign wealth fund, has spoken of an information war against his country, an assertion that finds sympathy with Russians weary of what they regard as years of Western condescension.
Mikhail Mechyov, a 42-year-old Moscow resident, said he saw jealousy behind Western warnings.
""It's natural to be cautious, but they are aimed at belittling the achievement of our country,"" he said. ""I think a lot has been done and it's great there is a vaccine.""
RUSSIAN WARNING
The Moscow-based Association of Clinical Trials Organizations (ACTO), a trade body representing the world's top drugmakers in Russia, had urged the health ministry to postpone the vaccine's approval until the final trial had been completed.
""It's the ambition, the desire to be first in a field in which, unfortunately, Russia cannot vie for a top spot,"" executive director Svetlana Zavidova told Reuters. 
""Our task is now to warn the population because we so far don't understand how they (the authorities) are going to carry out mass vaccination.""
Final trials, normally carried out on thousands of participants, are considered essential in determining safety and efficacy. Only about 10% of clinical trials are successful.
The Philippines and Kazakhstan have expressed interest in the vaccine, while a senior World Health Organization says it has not received enough information to evaluate it.
Roman, a taxi driver in the Vladimir region, invoked a conspiracy theory to explain why he would be avoiding it.
""It's all about a global plan to put microchips into people being pushed by Bill Gates. I have zero trust,"" he said.
Heidi Larson, who leads the Vaccine Confidence Project (VCP), a global surveillance programme on vaccine trust, said she feared Russia's rush could further dent public trust. 
A survey in 19 countries, carried out by VCP and Business Partners to CONVINCE, a U.S./UK initiative that is partly government funded, is set to show that Russians were the least trusting of vaccines.
Putin, who said the vaccine had already been administered to one of his daughters without any problems, and a string of other officials have insisted it is safe.

(Reuters) - Wall Street's main indexes jumped on Wednesday, with the S&P 500 crawling towards a record high in a broad rally led by tech stocks, although some investors were cautious following a stalemate over the new coronavirus relief bill.
Heavyweights  Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT), Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) and Apple Inc (O:AAPL) were some of the top boosts to the S&P 500.
All major S&P sectors climbed, with technology (SPLRCT), communication services (SPLRCL) and health (SPXHC) leading percentage gains.
The S&P 500 is about 0.5% below its intraday record high of 3,393.52. The benchmark index slipped after seven straight days of gains on Tuesday after coming within 0.4% of its peak, powered by historic fiscal and monetary stimulus and signs of a nascent economic recovery.
""We're seeing buyers show up very quickly, any chance they get when the market declines. To me, that's a very bullish sign,"" said Adam Sarhan, chief executive of 50 Park Investments in New York. 
The Nasdaq was the first of the three major indexes to bounce back to an all-time high in June. The Dow is about 6% below its February peak.
With a better-than-feared second-quarter earnings season largely over, investors are preparing for the risk of a contested U.S. presidential election in the fall. 
Democratic candidate Joe Biden on Tuesday picked Senator Kamala Harris as his choice for vice president. 
Meanwhile, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the White House and top Democrats in Congress may not be able to reach a deal on coronavirus aid, marking a fifth day without talks, as the stalemate blocked relief to tens of millions of Americans.
""We know a (stimulus) deal is going to get done. The question is what does that deal look like. Once we start getting certainty over that, that's when these stocks take off,"" Sarhan added.
At 10:55 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) was up 273.31 points, or 0.99%, at 27,960.22, the S&P 500 (SPX) was up 44.11 points, or 1.32%, at 3,377.80. The Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) was up 200.03 points, or 1.86%, at 10,982.86.
Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) jumped 8.4%, providing the biggest lift to Nasdaq, as it announced a five-for-one stock split in an attempt to make its shares more accessible to employees and investors.
Latest data showed U.S. consumer prices increased more-than-expected in July, but high unemployment is likely to keep inflation under control, allowing the Federal Reserve to continue pumping money into the economy.
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 2.52-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and by a 1.79-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.

The S&P index recorded 20 new 52-week highs and no new low, while the Nasdaq recorded 63 new highs and 14 new lows.

 Barclays  (L:BARC) is also among a small number of bidders for the automaker's credit card business, which has about $3 billion in outstanding balances, the WSJ reported, adding that a decision was expected in the next few weeks. 
Goldman currently has a much smaller presence in consumer banking, unlike larger peers JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) and  Citigroup  Inc (N:C), and it is an area Chief Executive Officer David Solomon has been aggressively looking to strengthen.
As part of its consumer push, Goldman has been offering personal loans and savings accounts through its online bank Marcus, which has grown quickly since its 2016 launch.
Goldman launched a credit card with Apple Inc (O:AAPL) last year that is synched with iPhone users' Apple Wallet and can be used to buy Apple products at a discount.
In their pitches to GM, Goldman and Barclays have pushed the idea of cars as e-commerce portals, according to the WSJ report.
GM's cars are equipped with in-dash e-commerce technology, allowing drivers to order food, find fuel or reserve hotel rooms by tapping icons on the dashboard screen, instead of using smartphones while driving.

GM, Goldman and Barclays declined to comment.

The plunge means Kingold's Nasdaq-traded shares have lost almost 60% of their value since a report in Chinese business media in June alleged it had obtained loans using fake gold bars as collateral.
In that report, Kingold chairman Jia Zhihong denied any wrong-doing. The company did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment on Wednesday.
""The decision to delist from Nasdaq resulted from the board of directors' review of numerous factors, particularly the cost and feasibility of ongoing compliance with the Nasdaq listing requirements and the company's current financial condition,"" Kingold said in a filing on Wednesday.
The company said it was twice informed by Nasdaq, on June 30 and July 2, that it was not in compliance with reporting requirements and a plan it submitted to regain compliance was rejected by the exchange.
""As such, the company understands that it is likely Nasdaq will commence procedures to delist the company's common stock,"" Kingold said, adding that its board decided not to pursue an appeal and to delist voluntarily.

Kingold said it expected trading in its shares to be suspended from Aug. 21, with the delisting effective Aug. 31.

1507,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 12, 2020 11:09AM ET</span>",Mnuchin Pushes for Limited Stimulus as Talks Remain Stalemated,"(Bloomberg) -- Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin renewed a push for a more limited next-round U.S. pandemic relief package of “a little more than $1 trillion,” on Wednesday, saying that Democratic demands for spending more could be discussed down the road.
“We can always come back later in the year or January and do a sixth bill,” Mnuchin said on Fox Business Network. “We don’t have to do everything at once.”
With no plans announced for any further negotiations, Mnuchin said “I can’t speculate” about prospects for a deal between the Trump administration and Democrats led by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer.
“If the Democrats are willing to be reasonable, there’s a compromise,” Mnuchin said. “If the Democrats want to focus on politics and don’t want to do anything that’s going to succeed for the president, there won’t be a deal.”
The four lead negotiators, including Mnuchin and Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, haven’t spoken since Friday, and the impasse risks dragging on for weeks. Both parties also have their presidential nominating conventions in the next two weeks, pulling some attention away from the relief-package talks.
The White House says Democrats must reduce demands for state and local aid and for $600 a week in unemployment relief to restart the talks. Democrats say the White House must agree to $1 trillion in spending beyond the $1 trillion Republicans already put on the table.
President Donald Trump for the time being appears content to let his executive actions deferring payroll taxes and providing a temporary $300 a week boost in unemployment aid to play out. With the stock market climbing toward all-time highs this month, there has been no pressure on him from that quarter lately. Major stock indexes rose again Wednesday, with the S&P 500 Index up 1.1% as of 10:02 a.m.
Mnuchin Wednesday reiterated the administration’s call for Congress ultimately to forgive the payroll tax liabilities that Trump deferred in an executive memo issued over the weekend. That could cost $100 billion, according to an estimate from the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.
Mnuchin also said that the Treasury is working on guidelines for the payroll tax deferral. A key challenge for the department will be how to assuage some employers’ concerns they could get stuck with large bills once the deferral period ends, if they passed the savings along to employees.
The Treasury chief also indicated that Trump’s executive order, which delayed levies that fund Social Security for those earning up to $104,000 from Sept. 1 through year-end, would be optional for companies to implement.
“We’re going to create a level of certainty for small businesses who want to do this,” he said.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened higher on Wednesday, bouncing back from Tuesday's losses after data suggested that companies' pricing power isn't being destroyed, despite the hit to demand from the sharp rise in unemployment caused by the pandemic.
Data released earlier showed the core consumer price index, which excludes food and energy, rose by 0.6% in July, its sharpest monthly increase in nearly 30 years and well ahead of expectations for an increase of 0.2%. That followed Tuesday's report showing that producer prices, too, rose by 0.6% last month.
The figures gave extra support to cyclical stocks, which were already enjoying a lift from strengthening hopes for a vaccine that will suppress the fear of Covid-19 and allow consumers to return to normal lives more quickly than previously expected. President Donald Trump had announced plans after the close on Tuesday to buy 100 million doses of  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA)'s experimental anti-Covid 19 drug if and when it passes its stage 3 tests.  Moderna stock rose 3.7% at the opening.
By 9:40 AM ET (1340 GMT). the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 256 points, or 1.0% at 27.943 points. The S&P 500, which briefly hit a record high on Tuesday before being caught by the later sell-off, was up 1.0%, while the Nasdaq Composite was up 1.1%.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock was among those most actively traded, rising 5.4% after the company announced a five-for-one stock split after the close on Tuesday. The move makes no difference to Tesla's market value by itself, and the broadening of its appeal to smaller investors is only marginal. However, it appears to have reheated speculation on the stock being imminently included in the S&P 500 index, which would force passively-managed index funds with trillions of dollars under management to find room for it in their portfolios.
Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) stock rose 2.1% to be within 2% of an all-time high after a federal appeals court overturned an antitrust ruling against the chipmaker that aimed to stop it obtaining royalties from makers of smartphones.
Tencent Holdings ADRs (OTC:TCEHY)  rose 2.7% after publishing second-quarter earnings that were ahead of expectations, reassuring investors that its core Chinese businesses are still highly profitable despite threats of U.S. sanctions against its WeChat messaging app.
In other markets, gold prices steadied as the CPI data restored market faith in the U.S. authorities efforts to reflate the economy. After rebounding overnight Gold Futures were down 0.2% at $1,942/oz. TheDollar Index inched down 0.1% to 93.494."

The report says the new level of capital spending is largely dedicated to the state-owned group's exploration and production business and will hold for the next three years.
Spending has been cut across the board to shore up cash as the oil industry contends with a realization that lower crude prices could be the norm for a long period of time after the coronavirus pandemic sapped fuel demand.

Aramco had said on Sunday it expected capital expenditure for 2020 to be at the lower end of the original $25 billion to $30 billion range and the company posted a 73% plunge in second quarter profits.

(Reuters) - Wall Street analysts praised Tesla Inc's (O:TSLA) move to split its richly valued stock into smaller chunks, saying it had the potential to extend a 200% rally in its shares this year by making it easier for retail investors to hold the stock.
Shares in the electric carmaker rose more than 6% in early trading. The stock, which traded at around $1,467 before the bell on Wednesday, is among the highest priced on Wall Street.
The five-for-one split - Tesla's first - comes at a time when analysts and investors have expressed concerns over the stock's high valuation in the market despite cash burn concerns.
""The move makes sense for Tesla, as it will make its shares cheaper and more accessible to young first-time retail traders using platforms like Robinhood,"" said Jesse Cohen, senior analyst at Investing.com.
""While stock splits are typically non-events for investors, the reaction seen in Tesla's stock following the announcement underlines the surging demand from the Robinhood-retail traders to get in on fast-growing tech names.""
Tesla's move follows a four-for-one split announced by Apple Inc (O:AAPL) in late July, the iPhone maker's first stock split since 2014.
""We believe institutional investors have turned the corner in a positive direction as Musk & Co. have not just talked the talk but walked the walk on its Model 3 sales and profitability trajectory over the last year despite COVID,"" Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said.
The world's most valuable carmaker posted stellar quarterly results last month, setting it up to be included in the S&P 500 index (SPX).
Twelve of 33 analysts covering the stock rated it at ""sell"" or lower, and just eight rated it at ""buy"" or higher. The median price target for the stock is $1,300, up from $615 in May.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's NatWest (L:NWG) is cutting at least 500 jobs across its retail business and closing one of its remaining offices in London as banks press on with cost-cutting in the face of a wave of expected loan losses due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
The state-backed bank is finalising a voluntary redundancy round targeting cutting 550 full-time equivalent roles across its branches and 'premier banking' premium service, union Unite told Reuters. A NatWest spokesman confirmed the redundancy process.
""We have taken the decision to invite applications for voluntary redundancy and will support those colleagues who apply with a comprehensive support package. There will be no compulsory redundancy as a result of this announcement,"" the spokesman said.
Around 800 staff are expected to leave once part-time workers are included, Unite national officer Rob MacGregor said, adding he understood the round was oversubscribed.
NatWest is also separately closing its Regents House office in London, which was home to one of the bank's biggest tech hubs and had space for 2,500 workers.
""We have been reviewing our London property strategy to better reflect how we will work in the future,"" a NatWest spokeswoman said. ""As a result, we will exit Regents House, and will reconfigure our London remaining properties at 250 Bishopsgate and 440 Strand.""
The bank has told the bulk of its staff they can work from home until next year.
Banks across the industry are looking to cut costs as their finances are dented by the pandemic, with official data on Wednesday showing the UK economy entered a deep recession in the first half of the year.
Unlike some rivals, NatWest pressed on with job cuts through the pandemic, including cutting more than 130 staff from minnow investment bank NatWest Markets despite improved trading in volatile markets.
NatWest chief executive Alison Rose reaffirmed the bank's target of cutting 250 million pounds from costs this year in July after the bank tumbled to a half-year loss.
Unite's MacGregor said he understood the pandemic meant more people were banking online but urged lenders not to cut too deeply.
""Tens of thousands of people working for banks have risen to the challenge that the pandemic created. The banks' response should not be a repeat of the austerity measures that we saw after the financial crisis.""

Reuters reported on Monday that TSB was phasing out more than 900 branch roles including dedicated cashiers, with staff affected asked to retrain for more complex jobs or take voluntary redundancy.

JOHANNESBURG/MUMBAI - As the coronavirus pandemic upended the global diamond industry, shuttering mines from Lesotho to Canada and disrupting supply chains, Rajen Patel swapped diamond polishing for peanut farming. 
Patel, who worked for a decade in India's Surat where about 80% of the world's diamonds are polished, joined the exodus of gem workers leaving the city as cases of the virus shot up. After taking up farming in his home village, he has no plans to return in the coming months.
""I won't earn as much I was earning in Surat, but I won't starve and there is no fear of getting infected with coronavirus,"" he said. 
Demand for diamonds has plummeted during the pandemic, freezing sales and squeezing prices. With temporary mine closures at risk of becoming permanent, diamond miners are seeking ways to extract more value from their stones. 
The lone bright spot has been steady demand for large, high-quality diamonds from affluent investors, according to financiers and sales data. 
""There are a lot more enquiries from people seeking to buy these luxury stones as a hedge,"" said Chris Del Gatto, CEO of the DelGatto Diamond Finance Fund, the largest non-bank lender to the diamond, jewellery and watch industries. 
Prices for high quality one-carat diamonds are rising steadily and are currently around 12% higher than at the start of the year, in contrast to still-depressed prices for lower-quality stones of the same size, data from trading platform RapNet shows.
For an interactive graphic, click https://graphics.reuters.com/HEALTH-CORONAVIRUS/DIAMONDS/azgvokyywvd/index.html
""If you are in that top end, the demand is still there because the people who go for these type of goods feel the pressure of the market downturn less,"" said Gus Simbanegavi, CEO of  Bluerock  Diamonds (L:BRD). But only a few miners are lucky enough to have deposits of large, high-quality diamonds, leaving some producers at risk. 
GRIM YEAR 
COVID-19 has forced miners to cancel or delay sales, with major diamond shows scrapped due to health and travel restrictions. The few sales that have taken place showed rough diamond prices down between 15% and 27%. 
""What has happened in the second quarter, I have never seen in my life,"" De Beers Chief Executive Bruce Cleaver told Reuters. ""There was no really properly functioning rough market."" 
Indian imports of rough diamonds plunged from $1.5 billion in February to just $1 million in April, data from the Gem & Jewellery Export Promotion Council shows. 
For an interactive graphic click here https://graphics.reuters.com/HEALTH-CORONAVIRUS/DIAMONDS/jznvnkmegpl/index.html
Antwerp, another diamond hub, saw rough imports drop 20% year-on-year in the first half, according to data from Antwerp World Diamond Centre. The city's exports of polished diamonds fell 46%. https://graphics.reuters.com/HEALTH-CORONAVIRUS/DIAMONDS/qzjpqwmknpx/chart.png
REAL OPPORTUNITY 
In a bid to survive, some miners are trying to change the traditional pricing game by securing a cut of onward polished diamond sales, and miners may eventually have direct tie-ups with luxury jewellery brands, RCC Diamond Consultants managing director Richard Chetwode predicts. 
Australia's Lucapa Diamond Co (AX:LOM) inked a deal with an unnamed ""high-end diamantaire"" to sell some of its high-value diamonds from the Mothae mine in Lesotho for $505 per carat plus a 50% share of the margin on the future polished diamond sale. 
 Lucara Diamond Corp , (TO:LUC), which mines in Botswana, struck a deal in July with Antwerp manufacturer HB Group under which the miner's diamonds larger than 10.8 carats are sold for a portion of the estimated polished price. 
""There is real opportunity within the diamond business as a whole to modernise the sales system,"" said Lucara CEO Eira Thomas. Lucara has also set up an online diamond sales platform.
In the meantime, miners are hoping production cuts will help prices recover. With Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO)'s massive Argyle diamond mine in Australia among those coming offstream soon, global diamond production will likely be reined in until 2025, independent analyst Paul Zimnisky forecasts. 
For an interactive graphic, click here https://graphics.reuters.com/HEALTH-CORONAVIRUS/DIAMONDS/rlgvdnewzvo/index.html
Several diamond mines shuttered due to the pandemic have also yet to reopen, including Stornoway Diamonds' Renard mine in Canada, Petra Diamonds' Williamson mine in Tanzania, and Firestone Diamonds' Liqhobong mine in Lesotho, which the company said would likely stay closed until April to preserve cash. 
Meanwhile, Africa-focused Petra Diamonds (L:PDL) is in restructuring talks with creditors, while in Canada's Northwest Territories, Rio Tinto's Diavik mine partner has sought creditor protection, saying it cannot afford the miner's cash calls. 
Even De Beers is feeling the pain, saying job cuts are likely, as it remains unclear whether supply will shrink enough to meet plunging demand in the global diamond jewellery market, which Bain estimated was worth $80 billion in 2019. 
Industry hopes that the pandemic would boost sales of engagement rings as people reassessed life priorities and more made plans to get married have not borne out. 
In retailer  Tiffany & Co 's (N:TIF) February-April quarter, engagement jewellery was the worst-performing category, with sales almost halving.
Overall, fine jewellery sales are expected to drop 19% this year, compared to a 3% rise last year, according to Euromonitor.

1518,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 12, 2020 07:25AM ET</span>",Electric carmakers seek out blank-check firms for funding as virus spooks private markets,"By Ben Klayman, Joshua Franklin and Paul Lienert
(Reuters) - Electric commercial truck maker  Nikola Corp  (O:NKLA) of Phoenix, Arizona, tried unsuccessfully to raise $1 billion in the private markets and only turned to a merger with a so-called blank-check company to go public as a way to raise the needed funds, its chief financial officer said.
Nikola quickly raised a $250 million commitment from lead investor CNH International (MI:CNHI) last summer, but market concerns about inflated valuations for some companies led the startup to consider an initial public offering before VectoIQ Acquisition Corp approached in late November, Kim Brady (NYSE:BRC) told Reuters this week.
A deal with the special purpose acquisition company, or SPAC, became a reality when it was able to arrange an additional $525 million from institutional investors like Fidelity Management & Research Company upon the closing of the $240 million acquisition, allowing Nikola to achieve its fundraising goal, he said in a telephone interview. 
Nikola's SPAC merger has been a catalyst for the industry as electric carmakers and other auto technology startups scramble to lock in the necessary funds to survive and develop their vehicles even as global demand for EVs slowly grows, according to interviews with 20 industry officials. 
""When we embarked on our Series D (fundraising round) we didn't think a year later we'd be a public company, but based on the market conditions we pivoted,"" Brady said. ""It worked out perfectly for us. We ended up at exactly the same place."" 
Nikola previously had eyed an IPO in late 2021 or even 2022, and if not for the SPAC deal it would likely still be private and slowing product development plans to conserve cash given the freeze in the capital markets caused by the coronavirus pandemic, Brady said.
Nikola's success - shares are up more than 320% since the deal was announced - has emboldened other startups to consider a SPAC merger to raise much-needed cash as public market investors chase Tesla-like returns. However, the trend also worries industry executives that some of these deals could fail, casting a pall over the sector. 
A SPAC is a shell company that raises money through an IPO to buy an operating company, typically within two years.
SPACs TO THE RESCUE
""Some of those companies have struggled for many years and now they're looking at SPACs as a kind of savior,"" Nikola's Brady said. 
EV startups Fisker Inc and Lordstown Motors Corp ran into similar problems raising funds privately before cutting SPAC deals to go public, industry officials said. 
Lordstown turned to a SPAC when efforts to raise $500 million privately froze as COVID-19 spread across America, Lordstown Chief Executive Steve Burns said.
""We thought we'd do the private (financing) and then the more conventional IPO, but COVID kind of messed that up,"" Burns told Reuters. ""It went from super-high interest to everybody pushed the pause button."" 
Without his SPAC, Burns would have had to delay plans, which include launching the electric Endurance pickup truck next year at Lordstown's Ohio plant and following that with other trucks and SUVs. 
Fisker CEO Henrik Fisker said private fundraising in the capital-intensive auto sector was not enough.
""Ultimately, when you're talking about billions of dollars, you have to go to the public markets,"" he told Reuters last month. 
Other EV companies approached by SPACs include electric delivery van startup Arrival, Lucid Motors, EV charging network ChargePoint Inc, Bollinger Motors, Canoo, Karma Automotive and VIA Motors International Inc, according to dealmakers and industry executives. 
Lucid, which raised $1 billion from Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund in 2018 and is planning to start production of its first EV in early 2021, intends to go public eventually and doing it with a SPAC is an option, CEO Peter Rawlinson told Reuters.
Karma's acting chief financial officer, Leo Lin, said the company's plan has always been to go public and SPACs are one option as it seeks to raise at least $300 million. ChargePoint CEO Pasquale Romano said the company plans ultimately to go public but its fundraising allows time to weigh all options. 
VIA did not respond to a request for comment and the others declined to comment. 
Another major factor is private investors get quicker access to their investments through the ability to cash out quickly with a SPAC, in some cases as fast as two or three months later, industry officials said.
TESLA ENVY
Investors are also riding the momentum of the EV market, industry officials said. While EVs still make up a small percentage of auto sales globally, many are betting that will change as they enviously eye how the stock of the EV industry's leader, Tesla (O:TSLA) has soared more than 500% over the past year.
""People are looking for the next Tesla,"" said Tony Posawatz, a former GM executive who led the development of the Chevrolet Volt plug-in hybrid car and headed the former Fisker Automotive. He is now a Lucid board member. 
EV companies, including Chinese newcomers Nio Inc (N:NIO) and  Li Auto Inc  (O:LI) are so popular with investors that some analysts are pushing No. 1 U.S. automaker General Motors Co (N:GM) to spin off its growing EV assets, an idea CEO Mary Barra has not dismissed.
Others with SPAC deals include Velodyne Lidar Inc, online used-car marketplace Shift Technologies Inc and electric truck powertrain maker Hyliion Inc, and Reuters has reported that electric bus maker Proterra Inc was in talks for such a deal.
SPACs are giving these firms access to capital faster than a typical initial public offering, especially in a sector where building a vehicle costs billions of dollars, industry officials said.
But companies better move quickly to take advantage, one SPAC executive said. ""It would behoove companies to try and strike while the iron's hot,"" said the executive, who asked not to be identified. ""When you have access to capital, take it."" 
The private market is not totally closed for those with strong partners. Last month, EV startup Rivian, backed by Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) and  Ford Motor Co  (N:F), raised another $2.5 billion.
Some industry officials worry easy money for less-developed startups will lead to trouble when those companies cannot deliver on their promises fast enough. Shares of Fisker Inc's SPAC took a hit recently when the EV startup disclosed it would not close a deal by the end of July, as it had hoped, to use Volkswagen AG's (DE:VOWG_p) EV platform for its vehicles.

""We're sitting on what I think is a massive bubble. There's going to be a bubble pop,"" said one EV executive who has not taken the SPAC approach to fund raising and asked not to be identified. ""It's going to put a cloud over the space.""

1519,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 12, 2020 07:05AM ET</span>",Stocks - U.S. Futures Higher on Stimulus Hopes; Dow Futures Up 250 Pts,"By Peter Nurse   
Investing.com - U.S. stocks are set to open higher Wednesday, rebounding after Tuesday’s late selloff, with investors still unwilling to abandon hopes of a stimulus package from Capitol Hill.
At 7:10 AM ET (1110 GMT), US 500 Futures traded 24 points, or 0.7%, higher, the Dow Futures contract rose 250 points, or 0.9%, while Nasdaq 100 Futures gained 95 points, or 0.9%.
At the close Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.4%, the S&P 500 index lost 0.8%, registering their first declines in eight sessions, and the NASDAQ Composite index lost 1.7%.
The losses had been driven by a rise in long-term bond yields, as investors braced for a massive auction of 10-year notes from the Treasury later Wednesday. 
Doubts still exist over whether U.S. lawmakers will strike an agreement on an additional round of fiscal stimulus to support the economy. Meanwhile, President Donald Trump is reportedly contemplating another executive action that would amount to a roughly $100 billion capital gains tax cut for investors, although it would almost certainly face legal challenges from Congress.
Atlanta Fed President Thomas Barkin increased the pressure on Congress, stating Tuesday that the economy could take another downturn if U.S. policymakers fail to provide more financial aid.
Stocks are being supported a little by Democratic Party presidential candidate Joe Biden's choice of California Senator Kamala Harris as his running mate Tuesday. Harris belongs the more moderate wing of the party, and her presence on the ticket points to a reduced risk of an extreme progressive influence in the White House if the Democrats win in November.
The global tally for confirmed cases of Covid-19 is now over 20 million, with the death toll rising to over 741,000, according to data aggregated by Johns Hopkins University. The U.S. has by far the most cases at 5.14 million, and deaths at 164,537. 
The economic slate centers around consumer prices for July, with the key core CPI  release expected to have risen 0.2% in the month, the same as in June. 
Elsewhere, earnings are expected from the likes of Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO),  Lyft  (NASDAQ:LYFT). Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) reported earlier, handily beating expectations.
Oil prices pushed higher Wednesday, helped by the American Petroleum Institute showing a larger than expected draw in crude inventories of 4.4 million barrels, versus a 3.2-million-barrel forecast. Official government numbers are due later Wednesday.
Additionally, the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries will also release its monthly market report Wednesday, which will include their production numbers for July, along with the group’s outlook on demand for the remainder of this year and 2021. 
U.S. crude futures traded 1.5% higher at $42.23 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract rose 1.5% to $45.10. 
Elsewhere, gold futures slipped 0.1% to $1,943.60/oz, continuing this week’s sharp selloff after the yellow metal had registered all-time highs above $2,000. EUR/USD traded 0.3% higher at 1.1770.

1521,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 12, 2020 06:25AM ET</span>","U.S. companies should consider slavery reparations, Vista Equity CEO says","By Jessica DiNapoli
(Reuters) - The COVID-19 pandemic has hit Black Americans especially hard after decades of social and economic injustices, but it also presents an opportunity for systemic change, said financier Robert Smith, the wealthiest African-American according to Forbes.
In a video interview with Reuters, the CEO of private equity firm Vista Equity Partners said companies that profited from the Transatlantic slave trade should consider making reparations to African-Americans.
""I think that's going to be a political decision that's going to have to be made and decided upon. But I think corporations have to also think about, well, what is the right thing to do?"" Smith said in a video interview.
Corporations ""can bring their expertise and capital to repair the communities that they are directly associated with in the industries in which they cover,"" he added. ""I think that has to be a very, a very thoughtful approach. But I think action needs to be taken.""
The death of George Floyd in May reignited protests in the United States and globally against racism and police brutality. Floyd, an African-American man, died after a Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck for more than eight minutes. 
""People are saying now, what can I do to make real systemic change and eliminate and eradicate racism in America?"" said Smith. ""That is an outgrowth of the protest and the realization that this racism is unjust and can't stand."" 
Smith said he was pushing U.S. lawmakers to make more aid available to Black communities. The average small business has two months of working capital, whereas Black businesses have just two weeks, he said. 
""How do we restore, repair and regenerate the economic activity in these communities utilizing the force of the U.S. government and business and partnerships?"" Smith said. 
Smith said he has been focused on getting capital to community development financial institutions and minority depository institutions, that serve Black and economically disadvantaged communities. 
Roughly 70% of the African-American community does not have access to a bank branch, he said, leaving many reliant on the financial institutions specifically targeting minorities and economically disadvantaged areas.
Smith, who grew up during the late 1960s Civil Rights era and now runs a buyout firm that focuses on investing in software companies, said he sees a more broad-based coalition of support for equality for Black people. 
""The allies weren't as widespread,"" when he was growing up, Smith said. ""Employees of companies are also going to hold the leaders accountable to do something about it. We have a chance for systemic change.""

Smith, the first African-American to sign Warren Buffett and Bill and Melinda Gates' 'Giving Pledge', has supported Black people extensively in his philanthropic efforts. Last year, he pledged to pay off the student loan debt of the class of 2019 at the historically Black Morehouse College.

1522,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 12, 2020 05:36AM ET</span>","StockBeat: Asos Returns to Grace, Thriving on Lockdown","By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- Asos is on the way to reclaiming its position as the U.K. fast-fashion stock of choice.
Asos (LON:ASOS) stock rose as much as 9% in early trading on Wednesday after the company said that sales and profit for the full year are likely to be “significantly above market expectations”, as a result of a second quarter that showed more than just the (now routine) benefits of being an online-only stock in the time of coronavirus.  
It pared gains later to be up only 5.5% but was still on course for its highest close since November 2018. It’s now more than quadrupled from its March lows. The FTSE 100 was up 0.9% after absorbing a predictably awful 20.4% decline in GDP in the second quarter, the worst of any major industrialized economy.
Asos expects revenue to grow by between 17% and 19% and pretax profit to be between 130 million and 150 million pounds ($170 million to $196 million), due largely to the fact that customers are now retuning far fewer items.
Asos had fretted that the surge in new customers trying its services would result in a parallel surge in returns (at least, as soon as they were allowed out to the post office to send back the unwanted goods). That would have hit operating costs and margins.
But Asos appears to have underestimated the digital skills of its customer base.
“We have seen a significant and sustained reduction in returns rates since April,” the company said in a statement to the Stock Exchange on Wednesday.  “In part this reflects customer demand for 'lockdown' categories, such as activewear and face + body. However, rates have been further suppressed below estimated levels by a prolonged shift in customer behavior towards more deliberate purchasing across all product categories, even when sales momentum has improved.” (Our Italics)
Asos still wasn’t ready to declare victory, cautioning that “the extent of this outperformance and any impact beyond this financial year will be driven by how customer shopping behaviour normalizes.”
All the same, it seems that the company has definitively put behind it the problems that caused its share price to fall by more than half in 2018, when it was replaced in many investment portfolios by rival  Boohoo  (LON:BOOH).
It’s now Boohoo that has more to worry about, in the shape of allegations that it turned a blind eye to potentially illegal practices in its supply chain in Leicester, where staff had been working without social distancing and on wages below the national minimum wage. Asos, by contrast, had moved its supply chain away from Leicester’s sweatshops, even though unions have raised similar – if less dramatic – complaints about its facilities elsewhere in England.
Boohoo stock also rose more than 4% on the back of Asos' news, as investors priced in a similar development there. However, it's still around 25% below where it was before the supply chain allegations exploded. The company has started a review into what went wrong and its outcome is still uncertain."

Sales rose to 114.9 billion yuan ($16.5 billion) in the three months ended June, versus the 112.4 billion yuan average forecast. Net income was 33.1 billion yuan, compared with the 27.3 billion yuan projected.
China’s biggest social media company has benefited from an internet resurgence during Covid-19 but is grappling with economic malaise as well as a U.S. WeChat ban with potentially far-ranging impact. Tencent executives will seek to reassure the market it can withstand a White House campaign that’s already ensnared Huawei Technologies Co. and dozens of Chinese up-and-comers, in part by focusing on its core home market.
It won approval from Beijing to earn from Call of Duty Mobile, the smartphone version of a long-running franchise that will underpin its gaming business, and has charted a line-up of new titles for 2020 to shore up resilient franchises Peacekeeper Elite and Honor of Kings. It’s driving discussions to merge U.S.-listed Huya (NYSE:HUYA) Inc. and  DouYu International Holdings  (NASDAQ:DOYU) Ltd. to create a Twitch-like $10 billion local leader in games streaming.
One risk to its outlook was the surprise delay of Mobile Dungeon&Fighter, though analysts expect eventual approval for a Nexon Co. title that’s supposed to be Tencent’s tent-pole for the second half.
“2020 will be a big year for Tencent games,” China Merchants Securities analyst Leo Liu said. But there’s “concern about the delay of Dungeon and Fighter because it’s Tencent’s gaming blockbuster and masterpiece, which may affect performance ahead.”

It’s unclear how the White House will define that ban, but the sweeping language of the order -- which would bar “transactions” with the Chinese company from September -- leaves the door open for the administration to extend it well beyond WeChat.

(Reuters) - Eastman Kodak Co (N:KODK) increased spending on lobbying the U.S. government in the months before the Trump administration announced a $765 million loan to the photographic equipment maker, public disclosures filed with the Congress show.
The company spent $870,000 as ""expense relating to lobbying activities"" from April through June, according to the lobbying disclosures https:// 
Kodak had previously not spent any money on lobbying since an expense of less than $5,000 in the first quarter of 2019.
The company insisted it raised lobbying expenses while exploring support from the government due to the coronavirus outbreak. 
""With the onset of COVID-19, Kodak, like many businesses across the country, explored federal support for the company and our workers, as well as opportunities to assist the government, on the state and federal level, in response to the pandemic,"" a company spokesman said in an emailed statement. 
""This included our application for a federal loan to support the launch of Kodak Pharmaceuticals with the intent to bolster the domestic response to COVID-19"", the statement added.
The increase in Kodak's lobbying efforts was reported earlier by Bloomberg.
Kodak's $765 million loan agreement with the U.S. government to produce pharmaceutical ingredients was put on hold on Friday due to ""recent allegations of wrongdoing"".
Last week, senior Democratic lawmakers asked federal regulators to investigate securities transactions made by the company and its executives around the time it learned it could receive the loan. They cited concerns about insider trading.
Kodak said on Tuesday investigations by Congress and the Securities Exchange Commission have commenced, and could impact the loan's outcome.
The company also said it expects sales volumes and working capital to improve in the current quarter after reporting a 31% decline in quarterly revenue due to the pandemic.

June output grew by 8.7% from May, just above economists' average expectation in a Reuters poll for an 8% rise.
""It's been widely expected that UK will be in a recession. But the fact that May number was upgraded and the June number was better than expectations, is offering a little bit of encouragement,"" said Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell.

Unfold has raised $30 million in an initial funding round and entered into an agreement for certain rights to germplasm -- the genetic material from which plants grow -- from Bayer’s vegetable portfolio, the two firms said in a statement Wednesday.
While indoor farms that stack crops in vertical hydroponic rows are nothing new, Bayer (OTC:BAYRY) is betting its expertise in seeds will give it a valuable edge. The launch of Unfold also comes as urbanized megacities rush to improve food security. The coronavirus pandemic has shut borders and exposed the vulnerability of global food supplies.
For the tiny island nation of Singapore, that’s a particular concern. The city-state has a national goal of sourcing 30% of its food needs locally by 2030 -- a tall order considering its land constraints and rising sea levels.
“One thing all of us have seen in the vegetable business is in some cases the fragility,” said Unfold CEO John Purcell, who previously headed vegetables research and development at Bayer. “It’s a tragic situation but there’s no question it’s really raised people’s awareness about where food comes from and how we sustain the food supply chain.”
Lettuce, Cucumbers
Much of the knowledge comes from Bayer’s 2018 acquisition of  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON) Co., which was partly funded by Singapore’s state-owned investor. Unfold will be equally owned by both parties and headquartered in Davis, California with additional operations in Singapore. The startup is heavily recruiting while setting up labs for R&D.
The company will focus on lettuce, spinach, tomatoes, peppers and cucumbers, with seeds for some crops expected to be ready for sale within months. While genetically modified produce was a controversial flashpoint for Monsanto’s agriculture business, Purcell said they’re largely unavailable in the vegetables business and Unfold doesn’t plan to sell GMO seeds.
“Breeding now is nothing like it was 10, 15 years ago because we’re able to do so much more” using computer-simulation techniques, he said.
While some have put the market for vertical farming at $50 billion globally, Purcell said seed development is a smaller part of that. Unfold also plans to develop and sell the optimal techniques for vertical farming with its products, although it’s yet to finalize how profits would be shared with other partners.
“Bayer and Temasek will have equal ownership of Unfold at the start, but this may change over time,” a Temasek spokesperson said in an email. “Unfold has the flexibility to seek investment from other companies in the future.”
Bayer made its investment via Leaps by Bayer, its impact investing arm.

The numbers suggest handset demand in China remains weak despite indications of a recovery after coronavirus cases peaked, boding poorly for companies like Apple Inc (O:AAPL) and its local rivals such as Huawei Technologies Co Ltd.
Phone makers shipped 21.3 million handsets in July, versus 33 million a year earlier, according to the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology (CAICT), a state-backed think tank.
That marks a steeper decline than in May and June, when shipments dropped 10% and 16%, respectively.
In April, after a slump in the previous months due to the health crisis, CAICT reported smartphone shipments grew an unexpected 17% annually.
At the time, the jump suggested potential for a sales rebound for China's smartphone brands, which saw purchases plummet at the height of COVID-19.
China is one of the few countries where retail outlets have re-opened almost fully after a virus-related lockdowns.
Apple and its rival smartphone brands do not publicly release regional shipment data.

U.S. and Chinese negotiators are set to discuss implementation of the phase one trade deal in the coming days, with Beijing pushing for the recent measures targeting businesses including TikTok and WeChat to be on the agenda.
A virtual meeting will likely take place as soon as this week though a date hasn’t been finalized, according to people familiar with preparations for the talks who asked not to be named. Along with agricultural purchases and the dollar-yuan exchange rate, which are among topics to be discussed, Chinese officials intend to bring up President Donald Trump’s prospective bans on transactions with the two apps on national security grounds, the people said. They did not elaborate on what China hopes to achieve on these issues.
Seven months after the signing of the agreement which paused a tariff war that had roiled the global economy, the purchases of U.S. goods it entails are lagging far behind schedule. The coronavirus crisis and the concurrent deterioration in U.S.-China relations on everything from tech security to Hong Kong has meant the trade deal remains one of the few areas where Washington and Beijing are still cooperating.
The “one area we are engaging is trade,” Trump’s top economic adviser Larry Kudlow said at a White House press conference Tuesday. “It’s fine right now.” China’s commerce ministry and foreign ministry did not immediately respond to faxes seeking comment.
China is seeking to defuse an unpredictable confrontation with the U.S. that’s seen several of its tech champions targeted, with the latest actions spurring a potential sale of the U.S. operations of ByteDance Ltd’s wildly popular short video app to  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT). Trump is also banning U.S. transactions with Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) Ltd’s WeChat app, which has more than 1 billion users.
Trump’s executive orders, set to take effect in September, have potentially an even wider impact than the multi-pronged assault on telecommunications hardware provider Huawei Technologies Co., as they threaten to sever communication links among the people of the world’s biggest economies. The U.S. argues that Chinese apps which collect information on U.S. citizens pose a grave national security risk as the data is prone to being acquired by the Chinese government.
Meanwhile given the collapse in the global economy this year due to the pandemic, which Trump blames on China, Beijing was only a quarter of the way through its effort to buy more than $170 billion in U.S. goods this year by the end of June. On Tuesday Kudlow downplayed the shortfall, saying China had “substantially” increased purchases of U.S. goods.
China would need to buy about $130 billion in the second half of this year to comply with the original terms of the agreement signed in January, which laid out purchasing an additional $200 billion of U.S. goods and services over the 2017 level by the end of 2021.

1529,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 12, 2020 03:43AM ET</span>",Stocks - Europe Mixed; FTSE Outperforms Despite GDP Blow,"By Peter Nurse
Investing.com - European stock markets traded mixed on Wednesday, with the U.K. market outperforming amid signs of economic recovery despite the country suffering the worst contraction of any major economy due to the coronavirus.
At 3:45 AM ET (0745 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.2% lower, the CAC 40 in France rose 0.2% and the U.K.'s FTSE index was up 0.6%.
The U.K. officially entered recession Wednesday for the first time since the financial crisis in 2008 after the Office for National Statistics confirmed that the U.K. economy shrank by 20.4% in the second quarter, after dropping by 2.2% in the first. The U.K. had locked down later than many of its European peers, concentrating the impact on output more in the second quarter. In addition, its economy has a higher share of services - which have been particularly vulnerable to lockdowns - than for example Germany and France.
Helping the tone was the marked improvement in activity in June as GDP rose 8.7% month-on-month as lockdown restrictions eased.


Across the Atlantic, there remains uncertainty over whether U.S. lawmakers will agree to an additional round of big fiscal stimulus, after Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell stated late Tuesday that talks were at a stalemate.
Barring what now seems an unlikely bipartisan deal, the U.S. economy could be left with the measures proposed by U.S. President Donald Trump via executive orders to bypass Congress over the weekend. These only envisage a reduced level of support through enhanced jobless benefits.

1532,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 12, 2020 03:00AM ET</span>",ABN Amro to Exit Corporate Finance Outside Europe in Revamp,"(Bloomberg) -- ABN Amro Bank NV (AS:ABNd) will stop providing corporate finance outside Europe and exit trade and commodity financing altogether as the Dutch bank tries to turn around an investment banking division hit hard by market chaos caused by the coronavirus crisis.
As many as 800 jobs, or a third of the total, are at risk in a plan to hive off and wind down activities that account for about 45% of the unit’s client loans, the Dutch bank said on Wednesday. The process will take three to four years, it said. The natural resources and transportation and logistics parts of the business will focus on European clients only.
European lenders including Deutsche Bank AG (NYSE:DB), Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) SA and BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY) SA have been slashing and refocusing their investment banks as they seek to cut costs and get out of higher-risk businesses. Chief Executive Officer Robert Swaak accelerated his review of the investment bank as volatile markets hit profitability and caused large impairments at the unit.
The investment bank “has been unable to generate the required profitability at an acceptable risk level,” the bank said said. Efforts to lower risk since 2018 “were unfortunately insufficient. The results were further impacted by recent volatility and a downturn in certain markets.”
Net Loss
The bank reported a net loss of 5 million euros ($5.9 million) for the quarter on writedowns an a slowdown in leding prompted by the Covid-19 crisis. Provisions for loan losses declined to 703 million euros from 1.1. billion euros in the first quarter. ABN Amro said it expects provisions to total 3 billion euros this year, partly on costs to wind down loans at the investment bank. That’s up from an earlier prediction of 2.5 billion euros.
Corporate banking in the U.S., Asia, Australia and Brazil will be wound down, but the bank will retain its global clearing business, one of the world’s biggest, the company said. “Clearing has taken several de-risking measures in the past months following a large loss incurred earlier this year,” it said. The bank said it expects additional impairments related to job losses and the wind down of corporate loans.
ABN Amro is among the four banks with the highest exposure to Wirecard AG (OTC:WCAGY), the defunct payments company that prompted competitors  ING Groep  (AS:INGA) NV and Commerzbank AG (OTC:CRZBY) to take provisions of about 175 million euros each in the second quarter, Bloomberg reported in June. The bank said an “exceptional client file” contributed to the high impairments in the second quarter.
The corporate and investment bank accounted for 14.5% of group profit last year and the unit’s headcount was a similar share of the total. The investment bank’s activities carry much more risk ABN Amro’s retail business and require more capital as well, making it costly to squeeze out decent profits in good times.
In the previous quarter, the lender wrote down 460 million euros on two individual client cases, which contributed to its first loss since 2013. Even before the coronavirus crisis, the investment bank fell short ABN Amro’s 10% to 13% return on equity target.

TOKYO/BOSTON (Reuters) - Asian stocks slipped on Wednesday on growing uncertainty over whether U.S. lawmakers would strike an agreement on an additional round of big fiscal stimulus to support an economy still struggling with the coronavirus pandemic.
Hopes of vaccine development, however, prompted some investors to reduce safe-haven assets such as gold and government bonds, and to buy back battered stocks of companies hit hardest by the virus.
The mixed sentiment has led to choppy trade in Asia with the index of ex-Japan Asia-Pacific shares shedding 0.76% while Japan's Nikkei gained 0.2%.
Mainland Chinese shares fell 1.7%, weighed by worries about the economic recovery after data showed a slowdown in the country's money supply and bank lending growth.
European shares are expected to open lower, with Euro Stoxx 50 futures falling 0.6%.
On Wall Street, the S&P 500 snapped a seven-day winning streak after coming within reach of its all-time peak hit in February just before the global outbreak of the COVID-19.
The declines came as political gridlock between the White House and congressional Democrats over coronavirus relief continued for a fourth day.
Barring a bipartisan deal, the U.S. economy could be left with measures U.S. President Donald Trump called for on Saturday through executive orders to bypass Congress.
""We have enormous uncertainty. It appears it's getting harder for both sides to compromise as the election is nearing... Trump's proposals would be smaller than markets have expected. There's question over whether they are viable, too,"" said Junpei Tanaka, strategist at Pictet.
The U.S. election campaigns look set to gather steam after Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden selected Senator Kamala Harris as his choice for vice president.
The 10-year U.S. Treasuries yield dipped 1 basis points to 0.647% in Asia after hitting a one-month of 0.661% in previous trade.
On top of hedge selling ahead of the largest-ever 10-year note auction later in the day, bonds have lost some of their safe-haven allure also on rising hopes of vaccines against COVID-19.
Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Tuesday his country was the first to grant regulatory approval to a COVID-19 vaccine after less than two months of human testing.
While Moscow's decision raised some eyebrows, the news lifted hope some of the vaccines currently in development would become available earlier than expected.
Investors bought back hospitality industries stocks and other value-oriented shares, leading the old-economy centric Dow Jones to outperform the tech-focused Nasdaq.
Globally, the MSCI Value index has risen 1.6% so far this week while the MSCI Growth index lost 1.2%.
The most dramatic move took place in precious metals.
Gold fell 1.6% to $1,881.4 per ounce, a day after it suffered its biggest daily fall in seven years. Silver lost 3.2% to $23.99 per ounce, following its 15% plunge on Tuesday. 
Still, Michael Hsueh, Commodities & FX Strategist at  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) in New York said, there is a good chance this week's decline will attract fresh buyers.
""In today's instance, the vaccine news is likely not sufficient to change the macro narrative, insofar as it is seen as a medical mistake in advancing too quickly through testing procedures,"" he said, referring to the Russian vaccine.
Major currencies were little changed, with the euro almost flat at $1.1728 and the yen also moving little at 107.27 per dollar.
The New Zealand dollar slipped 0.4% after the country locked down Auckland following four new cases of COVID-19 and the country's central bank took a dovish stance.

Online food ordering company Just Eat Takeaway.com reported higher revenues and underlying profit for the first half of the year as the coronavirus pandemic led to a surge in orders.
Oil prices pushed higher, boosted by an industry report showing that U.S. stocks of crude fell more than had been expected last week, indicating that the recovery in fuel demand is still intact.

The company posted an operating loss of 12.6 billion yen ($118 million) for the April-June quarter, versus a year-before profit of 7.83 billion yen.
The result was worse than an average analyst estimate for a 3.43 billion yen loss compiled by Refinitiv, but in line with Toshiba's own prediction in June that operating losses in the April-September half may total 10 billion to 20 billion yen.
Toshiba last suffered a quarterly operating loss in the October-December quarter of 2016, at the peak of a crisis stemming from the failure of its U.S. nuclear power unit Westinghouse.
It maintained its annual profit forecast at 110 billion yen, down 15.7% from the previous year, avoiding a major downward revision thanks to its public infrastructure businesses that are relatively resilient to a global economic slump.

The $32 billion lender has 56 buy recommendations, and its consensus rating of 4.95 on a scale of 5 is the highest among the 50 largest banks globally, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Meanwhile its share price is down 32% this year, ranking it in the bottom four of that same group.
Coronavirus lockdowns and low interest rates have taken a toll on global financial stocks, and India’s banks are still reeling from a crisis among the nation’s smaller shadow lenders. Even so, attractive valuations and signs of demand picking up in the villages should stand ICICI Bank’s shares in good stead, said Sanjiv Bhasin, executive vice president at IIFL Securities Ltd.
“We are witnessing a strong monsoon rainfall, and the rural sector is doing very well,” Bhasin said. “The valuation of ICICI Bank gives a lot of comfort as it has been an underperformer.”
India’s second-largest public lender is trading at about 1.9 times book value, cheaper than the NSE Nifty Bank Index’s 2.7 times. Its earnings have held up, with a 36% rise in net income for the June quarter, helped by the sale of stakes in its insurance subsidiaries.
While the bank reported higher provisions against bad loans due to the pandemic, it plans to raise as much as 150 billion rupees through a share sale to institutions to boost its balance sheet. A number of peers have undertaken such financial buffer building this year, and passive flow is seen helping to support ICICI Bank’s stock.
“Funds that track the MSCI, FTSE, Nifty 50 and Sensex indexes will need to buy around 40.8 million shares (10% of the share issued in the qualified institutional placement) over the next couple of weeks and the stock could be supported and outperform its peers,” Brian Freitas, an analyst for Smartkarma, wrote in a note on ICICI Bank.

But with the measures to be imposed for a far shorter period than the previous lockdown, some investors remained optimistic.

1540,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 11, 2020 08:55PM ET</span>","Mexico's new warning labels on junk food meet supersized opposition from U.S., EU","By Anthony Esposito
MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - The United States, European Union, Canada and Switzerland, home to some of the world's biggest food companies, have pressed Mexico to delay upcoming health warnings on processed food and drinks, a World Trade Organization document showed.
The Mexican standard, scheduled to take effect in October, will require front-of-pack nutrition labeling that clearly describes the health risks posed when those products are high in sugars, calories, salt, and saturated or trans fat.
Mexico, the largest consumer of processed food in Latin America and the fourth-largest in the world, has long struggled with high rates of obesity and diabetes. That health crisis has been exacerbated by the novel coronavirus, which hits people suffering from those illnesses particularly hard. 
Obesity reached epidemic proportions in Mexico after it joined the North American Free Trade Agreement with the United States and Canada in the early 1990s, making processed food more easily available, several studies have shown.
Last week, the southern Mexican state of Oaxaca banned the sale, distribution and advertising of junk food and sugary drinks to children, becoming the nation's first state to do so.
According to WTO minutes of a May 13-14 meeting of the Committee on Technical Barriers to Trade, published on Monday, the U.S. delegation said it supports Mexico's public health objective of reducing diet-related non-communicable diseases but that it was concerned the planned labeling may be ""more trade restrictive than necessary to meet Mexico's legitimate health objectives.""
""Mexico has chosen more stringent nutrient thresholds than the thresholds set by other countries,"" the U.S. delegation said, citing the views of the government and nine trade groups.
The United States, Switzerland, Canada and the EU opposed the Oct. 1 implementation date. Washington and the EU sought a two-year delay while Canada asked for the start to be pushed back 12 months. Switzerland urged postponement without specifying a timeline. 
Washington said a delay was needed ""in light of the COVID-19 global pandemic, which has placed significant pressure on the food and beverage industry.""
The Mexican government did not immediately respond to a request for comment. But a Mexican government official with knowledge of the matter, who declined to be named, said: ""We told them there would be no additional time.""
Pepita Barlow, assistant professor of health policy at the London School of Economics and Political Science, said countries that are home to major multi-national food corporations such as Switzerland, the United States and EU most frequently opposed new food standards, focusing on trade costs and profits.
The Mexican government official said the countries opposing Mexico's standard were acting in a last-ditch effort to derail the changes and putting their concerns ahead of public health.
The Mexican private sector has also opposed the new rules. Jaime Zabludovsky, president of lobby group ConMexico which represents food and beverage companies, recently said the labels would confuse the public, according to Mexican media outlet Aristegui Noticias.
The government official said  Coca-Cola Co  (N:KO), PepsiCo Inc (O:PEP), Nestle (S:NESN) and Mexican breadmaker Grupo Bimbo (MX:BIMBOA) were among companies that asked for a delay.

The companies did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Representatives at the U.S., EU, Canadian and Swiss embassies did not respond to requests for comment.

(Reuters) - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc on Tuesday announced a five-for-one stock split, sending the electric carmaker's recently high-flying shares up 7% in extended trade.
Tesla's stock, which traded at $1,475 after the announcement, is among the highest priced on Wall Street, and the Palo Alto, California-based company said in a press release it was looking to make its shares more accessible to employees and investors.
Tesla's stock has surged over 200% this year, while shares of General Motors (NYSE:GM) and Ford Motor (NYSE:F) declined on fallout from the coronavirus pandemic.
Stock splits are a way for companies to make shares more accessible to retail investors, potentially attracting individual investors who make small trades. However, brokerages increasingly let customers buy parts of shares, making the benefit of share splits less clear than in the past. 
Tesla said stock holders of record on Aug. 21 would receive four additional shares after the close of trading on Aug. 28, with the stock trading on a split-adjusted basis beginning Aug. 31.
Tesla's stock split follows a four-for-one split announced by Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) in late July, the iPhone maker's first stock split since 2014.
Stock splits have become rare on Wall Street in recent years, with just three S&P 500 components announcing splits in 2020, compared with an average of 10 a year over the past decade, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices.
Tesla in July posted a second-quarter profit as cost cuts and strong deliveries helped offset coronavirus-related factory shutdowns, clearing a hurdle that could lead to the carmaker's inclusion in the S&P 500 index.
While many institutional investors have avoided Tesla's stock in recent years due to a lack of consistent profitability, the company has a strong following among individual investors.
Over the past 30 days, Tesla was second only to Apple as the most popular stock on the Robinhood trading app, according to Robintrack, a website that tracks Robinhood holdings. 
Tesla's stock split should not affect S&P Dow Jones Indices' potential decision to add the company to the S&P 500, which is weighted by companies' overall stock market values.
The share split will not make Tesla any less expensive in terms of actual earnings it delivers to investors. The stock currently trades at 112 times expected earnings over the next 12 months, according to Refinitiv. By comparison, GM is valued at eight times expected earnings, and Ford at 45 times expected earnings.

Guedes, who wants to privatize many state-run companies, said he still hopes to privatize state power company Eletrobras (SA:ELET6), the postal service known as Correios, the Santos Port Authority and Pré-Sal Petróleo S.A.
Guedes also addressed some legislative proposals that want to increase public spending in Brazil in light of the economic crisis, but said he firmly opposed raising a constitutional cap on spending currently in place. 
""If the president wants to be reelected, we have to act within our budget,"" he told reporters. 

At one point Guedes suggested that right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro could face impeachment if he allowed for the increased spending. He said his economy ministry would not support this measure, even if it gained traction within other parts of the Bolsonaro administration.

(Reuters) - The United States has entered an agreement with drugmaker  Moderna  Inc (O:MRNA) to acquire 100 million doses of its potential COVID-19 vaccine for around $1.5 billion, the company and White House said on Tuesday. 
The United States in recent weeks has made deals to acquire hundreds of millions of doses of potential COVID-19 vaccines from several companies as part of its Operation Warp Speed program, which aims to deliver a vaccine in the country by the end of the year.
Moderna's price per dose comes to around $30.50 per person for a two dose regimen.
With the exception of its deal with AstraZeneca (NYSE:AZN), which offered a lower price per drug in exchange for upfront research and development costs, all the deals price COVID-19 vaccines between $20 to $42 for a two dose course of treatment.
Moderna's vaccine candidate, mRNA-1273, is one of the few that have already advanced to the final stage of testing and is on track to be completed in September, the company said this month.
Moderna's deal with the U.S. only pays out in full if the drugmaker hits certain unspecific timing benchmarks for vaccine delivery. 
The United States has advanced purchase agreements with Johnson & Johnson (N:JNJ), AstraZeneca Plc (L:AZN), Pfizer Inc (NS:PFIZ) and BioNTech SE (F:22UAy), and Sanofi SA (PA:SASY) and GlaxoSmithKline Plc (L:GSK) for their respective vaccine candidates. 
The agreements would lock in more than 500 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine for the U.S., assuming that the companies involved receive regulatory approval. Some deals also give the United States an option to purchase additional doses. 
The U.S. government previously gave Moderna around $1 billion to fund its research efforts, bringing total U.S. funding to around $2.5 billion.

Other countries, including Japan, the United Kingdom and Canada, have forged similar deals with drugmakers.

1545,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 11, 2020 05:45PM ET</span>",U.S. insurers' coronavirus costs are less than feared so far,"By Alwyn Scott
(Reuters) - The coronavirus pandemic dealt a relatively modest $2.5 billion blow to five insurers with large U.S. operations in the second quarter - a cost that was far less than feared and which the industry has absorbed without touching capital, analysts said.
American International Group Inc (N:AIG) and Chubb Ltd (BN:CB) said payouts on claims related to the disease accounted for most of their financial hit, which was mostly on property and casualty policies.
Others including Travelers Companies Inc (N:TRV), MetLife Inc (N:MET) and Prudential Financial Inc (N:PRU) lost money on their private equity investments due to market declines in the first quarter, which are reported on a three-month lag. Those losses are expected to reverse, since the market has recovered.
Insurers had sounded alarms about potentially crippling payouts if they were required to pay claims related to coronavirus on business-interruption policies.
Those payouts could still happen, depending on the outcome of litigation. Two cases have so far been decided in insurers' favor.
It may still be too early to say insurers are not at risk of major claims from the coronavirus and a related respiratory disease, COVID-19, said Piper Sandler (NYSE:PIPR) analyst Paul Newsome.
""We still don't know what the extent of COVID claims will be in the third quarter,"" he said.
But insurers now have better predictions about COVID-related mortality and are well-capitalized, said Andrew Kligerman, analyst at  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN). ""The industry is positioned to see some growth if and when we can pull through COVID,"" he said.
Here are details of coronavirus-related impacts on the insurers and their outlooks for the rest of 2020:
CHUBB
Chubb tallied $1.16 billion in after-tax coronavirus-related reported and unreported claims, which contributed to a net loss of $331 million for the quarter. The company is based in Zurich, but has a significant presence in the United States.
Net premiums written fell by $191 million, mainly from workers' compensation and commercial casualty payments, including refunds on auto policies. Chubb said its investment income also fell by an undisclosed amount.
The company expects full-year premium revenue to increase, Chief Executive Evan Greenberg said on a conference call. 
AIG
AIG's general insurance business reported $458 million worth of claims and expected claims related to the pandemic in the second quarter, in line with its expectations. So far this year, its tally https://www.reuters.com/article/us-aig-results/aigs-pandemic-losses-hit-730-million-for-first-half-of-2020-ceo-idUSKCN2501YV of such costs is $730 million. 
AIG did not break out the impact on its life and retirement business, but said losses on private equity investments, yield compression and higher mortality rates drove a decline in adjusted pre-tax profit for that unit during the quarter.
AIG is already seeing signs that the second quarter was a ""low watermark"" for sales, Chief Executive Brian Duperreault said.
PRUDENTIAL
Prudential (NYSE:PUK) did not detail coronavirus effects specifically, but said its group insurance, retirement and individual life businesses were affected in positive and negative ways. Prudential also recorded $2.7 billion in investment losses, but did not say how much related to coronavirus. 
The company said it could experience a $70 million earnings decline for every additional 100,000 pandemic fatalities in the United States. Prudential anticipates about $60 million in costs in the second half related to the disease, which will be offset by about $30 million in benefits, such as lower travel and entertainment expenses.
TRAVELERS
The pandemic and its effect on the economy resulted in $114 million in direct losses, with the largest impact in workers' compensation coverage, Travelers said. Its portfolio of non-fixed income investments lost $234 million before tax due to the market decline in the first quarter, the results of which are reported a quarter later, the insurer said.
""We expect to experience the impacts of economic disruption"" on revenue in coming quarters, Chief Financial Officer Dan Frey said on a conference call, though the duration and intensity of the impact remain unclear. On investments, while markets have recovered, fund managers may ""not be as quick to write back up the valuations they just marked down,"" he added.
METLIFE
MetLife lost $555 million on its private-equity investments because of first-quarter value declines. But its core businesses experienced few effects from the pandemic, with gains on some areas being offset by others, Chief Financial Officer John McCallion told Reuters.

He predicted a ""strong recovery"" in investment income this quarter, and a mid-single-digit return on its private equity portfolio, which was valued at $7.2 billion on June 30.

1547,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 11, 2020 05:25PM ET</span>",California private debt fund manager charged by U.S. prosecutors with fraud,"By Jonathan Stempel and Lawrence Delevingne
(Reuters) - A Los Angeles-area money manager who became a prominent advocate for direct lending to businesses has been criminally charged with defrauding clients into thinking he invested their money successfully, enabling him to collect millions of dollars in illegal fees.
Brendan Ross, 47, who once oversaw more than $1 billion of assets at Direct Lending Investments LLC, was arrested on Tuesday and charged with 10 counts of wire fraud, U.S. Attorney Nicola Hanna in Los Angeles said.
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filed related civil charges.
A lawyer for Ross did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The SEC had sued Direct Lending Investments in March 2019, and the firm was later put into receivership.
In a July 10 court filing, the receiver said investors might recover only 27% to 34% of the $789.6 million of assets on the firm's books as of March 31, 2019.
Prosecutors said Ross had directed his funds to invest in a company that made loans to small businesses and retailers, and the funds would make money when borrowers made timely payments.
But according to the indictment, Ross falsified monthly reports to make it appear that borrowers who had fallen behind on payments were actually current, and concealed how ""payments"" actually came from fee rebates from the borrowers' lender.
Prosecutors said this let Ross inflate his funds' value by more than $300 million over four years, and collect higher performance and management fees.
Authorities said Ross' improper conduct occurred from roughly 2014 to early 2019.
Ross, of La Canada Flintridge, California, became a familiar direct lending advocate through appearances on CNBC, Fox Business and the Milken Institute's Global Conference.

The SEC built its earlier case against Ross as part of a broader scrutiny of private funds that make higher-risk loans, but which are subject to less oversight and less stringent capital requirements than banks.

1548,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 11, 2020 05:20PM ET</span>","Boeing 737 MAX cancellations rise, deliveries drop as crises drag on","By Eric M. Johnson and Ankit Ajmera
(Reuters) - Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co customers scrubbed more than 400 orders for the U.S. planemaker's grounded 737 MAX jets this year, while the company's overall aircraft deliveries slumped to only four in July, monthly numbers showed on Tuesday.
Boeing said it lost another 43 orders for the 737 MAX jet in July, bringing the total number of canceled orders, including those where buyers converted a MAX to a different model, to 416 for this year.
Based on a tighter accounting standard, Boeing said order cancellations and conversions now stand at 864 for the MAX, recertification for which is still hanging in the balance more than a year after its worldwide grounding due to two fatal crashes.
The four deliveries - one 767 freighter for FedEx (NYSE:FDX), one 777 freighter for DHL, and one 787 Dreamliner each for Air France and Turkish Airlines - were down from 19 a year earlier, taking the total to 74 planes this year. 
Boeing delivered a record 806 aircraft in 2018, before the 737 MAX crisis erupted. The COVID-19 pandemic has sapped demand for new Boeing jets.
Brokerage Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) said on Tuesday it expects Boeing to deliver 138 aircraft in 2020, down from 380 last year.
Boeing did not win any new orders in July, and its cancellations included 35 previously scratched orders for the 737 MAX by aircraft lessors AerCap and Alafco.
Fresh 737 MAX cancellations last month were by Canada Jetlines (OTC:JETMF), which struck off five orders, Avolon scrapped two orders and a business jet customer canceled one order.
Additionally, Boeing removed nine 737 MAX airplanes from its backlog to adjust for jets ordered in previous years but unlikely to be delivered currently.

On an adjusted basis, Boeing said 52 planes were canceled last month, bringing lost orders to 836 for the year as of July end.

The photographic equipment maker's stock plunged on Monday after the U.S. government blocked a $765 million loan to the company, which was going to make drug ingredients for use in possible COVID-19 vaccines, because of ""alleged wrongdoing"" by executives. 
Kodak said on Tuesday investigations by the U.S. Congress and the Securities Exchange Commission have commenced, and could impact the outcome of the loan from the U.S. International Development Finance Corp.

Senior Democratic lawmakers had asked federal regulators to investigate securities made by the company and its executives around the time it learned it could receive the government loan.

1550,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 11, 2020 05:10PM ET</span>",Explainer: How the U.S. could block WeChat and TikTok from Americans,"(Reuters) - President Donald Trump has threatened to ban the short-video app TikTok and messaging service WeChat by late September on grounds that the Chinese-owned apps pose a national security threat. It would mark the first time the United States has attempted to shut down widely used mobile internet apps.
How would the U.S. go about blocking access to TikTok and WeChat?
The administration could order smartphone software giants Apple Inc (O:AAPL) and Alphabet Inc's (O:GOOGL) Google to remove WeChat and TikTok from their app stores.
When the Indian government in June banned 59 Chinese apps, including TikTok and WeChat, it asked Google and Apple to remove the apps from their app stores, two sources told Reuters. Both companies complied. 
It would be a rare and possibly unprecedented step for the United States: Apple has not disclosed any app takedown requests from the U.S. government since it started publishing information on such requests in the second half of 2018. 
The government could also order the apps to stop offering access to U.S. users by threatening them with legal repercussions. In India, some banned apps pulled themselves from app stores. 
If I already have TikTok and WeChat on my phone, will I still be able to use them? 
The apps would probably work, but government orders may bar updates, blocking access to new features and bug fixes. 
Jay Kaplan, CEO of cybersecurity firm Synack and a former National Security Agency cybersecurity analyst, said it is ""highly probable"" Apple and Google can remotely disable installed apps, though experts were not aware of any instance in which they have done that recently. Apple and Google declined to comment.
Could users download the apps somewhere else?
Users with phones running Google's Android can install apps from alternatives to Google's official app store. Theoretically, they could download WeChat or TikTok from the companies' websites. 
Using alternatives to Apple's App Store to install apps is more difficult, though not impossible. Ron Deibert, director of the Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto, which has done extensive technical and censorship analysis of WeChat, said using unofficial stores carries the risk of installing versions of popular apps altered with viruses or scams. 
Would U.S. users be able to access Web versions of the app?
U.S.-based hosting services such as Amazon.com Inc’s (O:AMZN) AWS and content delivery providers such as  Akamai Technologies Inc  (O:AKAM) could be banned from doing business with targeted apps, said Angelique Medina, director of product marketing at network intelligence firm ThousandEyes. Hosting sites outside the United States could still service Americans, but likely at slower speeds.
Could internet service providers block users from accessing these services? 
The government could order ISPs to block users from accessing WeChat's and TikTok's servers, as China does to enforce its Great Firewall. But it would not be an easy task for the U.S. government because the United States has thousands more ISPs than China, said Chester Wisniewski, a researcher at cybersecurity provider Sophos. A U.S. order to ISPs also could be challenged in court, legal experts say.
In India, the government did order telecom companies and other internet providers to block the Chinese-origin apps, according to notices seen by Reuters. Experts say there are no known cases of the U.S. ordering ISPs to ban access to sites.
What about VPNs?

Americans could use virtual private networks, or VPNs, to circumvent ISP blocks and browse the internet as if they were overseas. This is how internet users in China are able to reach services, such as Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), banned by the Great Firewall. Network experts said the same loophole would exist in the United States.

DETROIT (Reuters) - Polestar, the premium electric vehicle maker owned China's Geely and Volvo Cars, would like to eventually be publicly listed, but the immediate focus is on successfully launching the new Polestar 2 electric sedan, the startup's chief executive said on Tuesday.
""The mid- and long-term perspective indeed is to be ... open for the stock market and an IPO,"" CEO Thomas Ingenlath told reporters on a conference call. ""This is indeed one track that is absolutely still on and has not changed"" since Volvo Cars CEO Hakan Samuelsson said in January 2019 that Polestar could eventually be listed publicly, Ingenlath added.
Volvo Cars is owned by Geely.
Polestar's top executive said the focus now is on a successful launch of Polestar 2, dismissing a point made that other EV makers like  Nikola Corp  (O:NKLA) and Fisker Inc have gone public or announced plans to do so without having launched a vehicle.
""It's not about the short term thinking. We have a long-term ambition,"" Ingenlath said. ""Let's see where we are in a year's time.""
Polestar will sell the Polestar 2 in China, Europe and the United States and the company is targeting annual sales of more than 50,000 within two to three years, he said.
The car will compete with Tesla Inc's (O:TSLA) Model 3 sedan, but will be targeted at owners of the gasoline-powered luxury sedans from  Daimler  AG's (DE:DAIGn) Mercedes-Benz, BMW AG (DE:BMWG) and Volkswagen AG's (DE:VOWG_p) Audi brand, Ingenlath said. 
Polestar, which was launched in 2017, already has the low-volume halo Polestar 1 hybrid performance car that sells for about $150,000. Deliveries of the company's first high-volume car, the Polestar 2, have begun in Europe and will start in North America next month, officials said.
Both cars are built in China and there are no immediate plans to build a Polestar car in the United States, as the company needs to build sales in that market first, Ingenlath said. 

The Polestar 2 will be sold through standalone retail locations called ""Polestar spaces"" that are set up in high-traffic pedestrian areas, officials said. Those showrooms will be owned and operated by Volvo dealers, which will also serve as the service locations for the cars.

Investing.com –  The S&P 500 ended Tuesday in the red as a wave of selling hit stocks late in the day on reports that fiscal talks on the next coronavirus stimulus package had reached a stalemate. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.37%, or 103 points. The S&P 500 fell 0.79%, while the Nasdaq Composite fell 1.69%.
In an interview with Fox News, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell confirmed that talks between the Democrats and the White House were at ""a stalemate,"" souring investor optimism that lawmakers will agree on a new round of fiscal stimulus sooner rather than later.
Industrials pared gains on the news, as investors reined in bets on travel stocks, with the airlines, in particular, losing wind.
American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL), United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) gave up gains to turn negative, while  Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) ended up 1%.
Boeing (NYSE:BA) closed up just 0.4%, after shrugging off earlier data showing that the pace of order cancellations last month outweighed the pace of new orders its customers continue to pull orders for its much-maligned 737 MAX jets.
Tech's move deeper into the red also exacerbated the downside in the broader market, paced by a decline in the so-called fab 5 companies.
Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), which account for about 25% of S&P 500, all fell.
On the vaccine front, Russia became the first country to approve a Covid-19 vaccine, which President Vladimir Putin said had already been given to his daughter.
But while many health professionals have raised questions over the safety and efficacy of the Russian-dubbed ""Sputnik-V"" vaccine, which went into clinical trials less than two months ago on June 17, the news helped lift investor optimism that an inoculation could be found sooner rather than later.
Financials held onto some gains, thanks to a jump in banks following a move higher in bond yields.
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) was up 3.2%, while Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) rose 0.8% and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) was up more than 1%.
Higher interest rates are seen as a boon for banks, boosting net interest margin – the difference between the interest income generated by banks and the amount of interest paid out to their depositors.
In earnings news,  Novavax  (NASDAQ:NVAX), which is in the midst of developing a potential coronavirus vaccine, fell 16% as the company's announcement that three contracts for its potential coronavirus treatment were not exclusive offset better-than-expected quarterly results.
Canada Goose (NYSE:GOOS) fell 5% after the retailer's gloomy guidance offset quarterly results that were not as bad as feared."

 Lyft  (NASDAQ:LYFT) may report a loss per share of $1.07 on sales of $340 million. Last week, rival Uber (NYSE:UBER) reported gross bookings down 35% year-over-year, and revenue down 29%. Shares are down almost 30% since January.
Tencent Holdings Ltd ADR (OTC:TCEHY) is forecasted to report earnings per share of 41 cents on sales of $16 billion. The Chinese web company may be out of favor with U.S. President Donald Trump, but investors seem to be shrugging tensions off. Shares are up about 37% this year.
3. Economic data
The Core Consumer Price Index (CPI) is expected to have risen 0.2% in July, the same as in June. The inflation measure shows the changes in the price of goods and services, excluding food and energy. A higher than expected reading should be taken as positive/bullish for the dollar, while a lower than expected reading should be taken as negative/bearish.

1556,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 11, 2020 03:36PM ET</span>","U.S. Stimulus Impasse Could Last to September, Escalating Risks","(Bloomberg) -- With no talks scheduled on a virus-relief package seen as vital by Federal Reserve officials and market participants alike, the stalemate between Republicans and Democrats risks dragging on for weeks.
The four main principals -- Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer -- haven’t talked since Friday. And Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Schumer continued to exchange rhetorical broadsides on the Senate floor Tuesday, without new ideas for a compromise.
The White House says Democrats must reduce demands for state and local aid and for $600 a week in unemployment relief to restart the talks. Democrats say the White House must agree to $1 trillion in spending beyond the $1 trillion it already put on the table.
President Donald Trump for the time being appears content to let his executive actions deferring payroll taxes and providing a $300 a week boost in unemployment aid to play out. With the stock market flirting with all-time highs, there’s no pressure on him from that quarter. The S&P 500 Index headed for an eighth straight day of gains Tuesday.
“It may take a catalyst like a slide in the stock market to generate the political will necessary to pass legislation,” said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics.
For the moment, Trump’s executive orders might have helped sentiment. But economists including Zandi have flagged their difficulty of implementing them, along with insufficient size.
“Even if they were magically fully implemented today, retroactive to the start of this month, they would provide only a $400 billion boost to the economy by year’s end,” Zandi said. That’s “well short of the $1.5 trillion I estimate is necessary to avoid backtracking into recession.”
Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond President Thomas Barkin said Tuesday that for the economy, Covid-19 threatened to become like a “sinkhole” in the road, which needs fiscal support to cover over. “If Congress takes away support too abruptly, you know what could happen to my metaphorical automobile.”
Nevertheless, some congressional staff are speculating that the political standoff could continue into September, when lawmakers will have to forge a consensus on how to keep the government running when the new fiscal year begins on Oct. 1.
Stopgap Spending
Neither side at this point is actively working on such a bill combining stimulus and agency funding. The fiscal 2021 appropriations process stalled in the Senate over the summer, when Democrats said they would attempt to add police reform and Covid relief riders to otherwise bipartisan funding bills. Republicans, fearing moderates in their caucus might peel off to back the moves, then suspended work on the 12 annual measures.
That means a stopgap spending bill to keep the government functioning beyond Oct. 1 is all but assured -- offering a hard deadline for action on stimulus.
Pelosi on Sunday shot down the idea of combining virus relief and the appropriations process on Sunday, saying negotiators must get back to the table before then.
“Well, we have to. We have to,” Pelosi said during an appearance on CNN.
As of Tuesday afternoon, however, there still had been no direct communication between Pelosi and Mnuchin since Friday, according to an official familiar with the matter. Other congressional officials on both sides of the political aisle also said there had been no contact between her and McConnell, although they were holding out hope talks might be rejuvenated this week.
Perception War
Both the Republicans and Democrats are trying to win the perception war, and appear as having done more to compromise with an unreasonable partner.
McConnell has homed in on Democratic demands to reinstate state and local tax deductions that benefit wealthy homeowners in high-tax areas and to transfer some $915 billion to state and local governments.
“When the Speaker and the Democratic Leader say they will not allow another cent for schools to re-open or for the job-saving PPP unless they get a trillion dollars for a state and local slush fund that’s completely out of proportion to actual needs, they are playing hardball against children and parents,” McConnell argued on the Senate floor.
Democrats focus on the top-line level of spending, saying they were willing to shift from their $3.4 trillion House-passed proposal.
“Democrats offered to come down by $1 trillion. We asked our counterparts, Secretary Mnuchin, Mr. Meadows, to come up by $1 trillion. Meet us in the middle. They said no,” Schumer said Tuesday on the Senate floor.
“Facing the greatest domestic crisis of the 21st Century, where Americans are hurting health-wise and economically, the Senate Republican majority ran down the clock, tossed up an air ball, and then subbed themselves out of the game,” Schumer said.

1557,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 11, 2020 03:34PM ET</span>",S&P 500 in U-Turn as Tech Moves Deeper Into Red Amid Stimulus Stalemate,"By Yasin Ebrahim
Investing.com – The S&P gave up gains on Tuesday, as a plunge in tech offset a climb in sectors tied to the economy in the wake of souring optimism over hopes of further fiscal stimulus.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.05%, or 14 points. The S&P 500 fell 0.37%, while the Nasdaq Composite fell 1.12%.
In an interview with Fox News, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell confirmed that talks between the Democrats and the White House were at ""a stalemate,"" souring investor optimism that lawmakers will agree a new round of fiscal stimulus sooner rather than later.
Industrials pared gains on the news, as investors rein in bets on travel stocks, with the airlines, in particular, unwinding their gains for the day.
American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL), United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) and Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) gave up gains to turn negative.
Boeing  (NYSE:BA) was up just 1%, after shrugging off earlier data showing that the pace of order cancellations last month outweighed the pace of new orders its customers continue to pull orders for its much-maligned 737 MAX jets.
Tech's move deeper into the red also exacerbated the downside in the broader market, paced by a decline in the so-called fab 5 companies.
Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), which account for about 25% of S&P 500, were in the red.
On the vaccine front, Russia became the first country to approve a Covid-19 vaccine, which Russian President Vladimir Putin said had already been given to his daughter.
But while many health professionals have raised questions over the safety and efficacy of the Russian-dubbed ""Sputnik-V"" vaccine, which went into clinical trials less than two months ago on June 17, the news helped lift investor optimism that a cure could be found sooner rather than later.
Against the backdrop of rising optimism over a potential vaccine, sectors tied to the economy such as financials and industrials advanced.
Financials held onto some gains, thanks to a jump in banks following a move higher in bond yields.
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) was up 4%, while Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) were up more than 1%.
Higher interest rates are seen as a boon for banks, boosting net interest margin – the difference between the interest income generated by banks and the amount of interest paid out to their depositors.
In earnings news,  Novavax  (NASDAQ:NVAX), which is in the midst of developing a potential coronavirus vaccine, fell 16% as the company's announcement that three contracts for its potential coronavirus treatment were not exclusive offset better-than-expected quarterly results.
Canada Goose (NYSE:GOOS) fell 4% after the retailer's gloomy guidance offset quarterly results that were not as bad as feared."
1558,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 11, 2020 02:50PM ET</span>",Inspector general to audit U.S. oversight of auto safety standards,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Transportation Department's Office of Inspector General said on Tuesday it would audit oversight of U.S. vehicle safety standards, noting that more than 36,000 Americans were killed in traffic accidents in 2019.
The inspector general's office said it was launching a review of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) efforts to set and enforce Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS).
""Given the importance to the traveling public that all new vehicles and components meet federal safety standards, we are initiating a review of NHTSA’s FMVSS process,"" the inspector general's office wrote.
The NHTSA did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
In March, the NHTSA proposed sweeping changes to U.S. safety requirements to speed the deployment of self-driving vehicles without human controls. It proposed rewriting 11 vehicle safety standards that require traditional manual controls ""by revising the requirements and test procedures to account for the removal of manually-operated driving controls.""
The NHTSA proposed revising rules for occupant protection, steering controls, glazing materials, door locks, seating systems, side impact protection, roof crush resistance and child restraint anchorage systems. Some are to address vehicles that will be used only for making deliveries and will have no passengers.
Companies like General Motors Co (NYSE:GM), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc’s Waymo, Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc and Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co are aggressively testing automated vehicles.
The NHTSA said it was not proposing to change existing occupant protection requirements for traditional vehicles with manual controls.
It often takes the NHTSA years to finalize changes or adopt new motor vehicle safety standards.

In February 2018, the NHTSA finalized rules requiring ""quiet cars"" like electric vehicles and hybrids to emit alert sounds to warn pedestrians of their approach after a demand by Congress in 2010.

(Reuters) - The S&P 500 on Tuesday rose for an eighth straight session and was within striking distance of its February peak, a level last seen before the onset of the coronavirus crisis that caused one of Wall Street's most dramatic crashes in history.
The benchmark index was about half a percent below the all-time high it hit on Feb. 19, when investors started dumping shares in anticipation of what proved to be the biggest slump in the U.S. economy since the Great Depression.
Ultra-low interest rates, trillions of dollars in stimulus and, more recently, a better-than-feared second-quarter earnings season have allowed all three of Wall Street's main indexes to recover.
The tech-heavy Nasdaq (IXIC) has led the charge, boosted by ""stay-at-home winners"" Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN), Netflix Inc (O:NFLX) and Apple Inc (O:AAPL). The index was down about 0.1%.
The blue-chip Dow (DJI) surged 1%, coming within 5% of its February peak.
Value stocks have outperformed tech-focused growth stocks recently, reflecting market's confidence in improving economic outlook. On Tuesday, the Russell 1000 value (RLV) index rose 0.9%, while the Russell 1000 growth (RLG) index edged up 0.1%.
""COVID-19 really turned the light switch off on the economy - it happened very quickly - and the hope is that by and large, once we get a vaccine and distribute it to the masses, that we turn the switch back on,"" said John Petrides, portfolio manager at Tocqueville Asset Management in New York.
Aiding sentiment, President Vladimir Putin claimed Russia had become the first country in the world to grant regulatory approval to a COVID-19 vaccine. But the approval has concerned some experts as the vaccine still must complete final trials.
Investors are now hoping Republicans and Democrats will resolve their differences and agree on another relief program to support about 30 million unemployed Americans, as the battle with the virus outbreak was far from over with U.S. cases surpassing 5 million last week.
""The probability that fiscal and monetary stimulus will bridge the gap for the U.S. economy to reopen is going up, and that's what markets like,"" said Tim Shaler, chief economist for iTrustCapital in Newport Beach, California.
Also in focus are Sino-U.S. tensions ahead of high-stakes trade talks in the coming weekend.
Financials (SPSY) and industrials (SPLRCI), which have lagged the benchmark index this year, provided the biggest boost to the S&P 500 on Tuesday as it eyes its longest streak of gains since April 2019.
At 12:41 a.m. ET, the S&P 500 (SPX) was up 16.01 points, or 0.48%, at 3,376.48, about 17 points shy of its high of 3,393.52. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) was up 270.59 points, or 0.97%, at 28,062.03, and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) was up 10.45 points, or 0.10%, at 10,978.81.
Airlines and cruise operators, which would benefit from a full reopening of the economy, traded higher. The NYSE Arca Airline index (XAL) rose 4.9%, while  Royal Caribbean  Group (N:RCL),  Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd  (N:NCLH) and Carnival Corp (N:CCL) gained between 4% and 6.5%.
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 2.13-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and by a 1.56-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.

The S&P index recorded 41 new 52-week highs and no new low, while the Nasdaq recorded 82 new highs and nine new lows.

1560,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 11, 2020 02:20PM ET</span>",Cannabis industry readies for M&A after COVID-19 boosts weed demand,"By Shariq Khan
(Reuters) - After nearly a year of next-to-no deal-making, cannabis companies are gearing up for mergers and acquisitions as realistic stock valuations and the prospect of U.S. legalization attract buyers to a sector that has been decimated by oversupply and other issues, executives and investors say.
Profitable cannabis companies want to buy their way into niche segments and expand their brands, betting that the November U.S. presidential election will lead to weed becoming legal across the United States. Distribution deals could also help companies reach consumers who have shown an increased appetite for pot products since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic.
Aphria (NASDAQ:APHA) Inc, one of Canada's largest producers, is open to making purchases if it adds a well-known consumer brand to its beverages portfolio or if it helps the company overcome a lack of chocolate production, CEO Irwin Simon told Reuters.
 Canopy Growth  (NYSE:CGC) Corp, the largest Canadian pot producer by market value, had about C$2 billion in cash at the end of June. The strong balance sheet allows it to pursue acquisitions and the current market conditions would provide frequent opportunities, a company spokesman said. Canopy is backed by Corona beer maker Constellation Brands Inc (NYSE:STZ).
ROCKY START
Since its peak in August 2018 in the run-up to Canada's legalization of recreational weed, cannabis stocks tracker MJ ETF has dropped 70%. M&A fell 80% and capital raising slumped 70% to $2.71 billion through July 31, according to the Viridian cannabis deal tracker.
(GRAPHIC: Cannabis M&A activity plunged this year Cannabis M&A activity plunged this year - https://graphics.reuters.com/CANNABIS-MERGERS/oakpemwowpr/chart.png)
However, as pot demand surged in lockdowns, stock prices have recovered, raising prospects that funding will be available for some deals.
""You'll still see a lot of the same funding sources but they're going to be much more diligent and cautious with their dollar,"" said Avis Bulbulyan, CEO at cannabis consultancy Siva Enterprises.
All-stock deals are expected to be the trend, but companies with cash could also spend it on U.S. expansion after the election, Katie Ashton and Eric Berlin of the Chicago office of the Dentons law firm told Reuters in an email.
ALL EYES ON ELECTIONS
Scott Paterson, chairman of media company Miraculo Inc, says a Democratic victory would instantly set in motion significant expansion for U.S. multi-state operators. Canadian producers' cross-border ambitions also hinge on U.S. legalization, which Democratic candidate Joe Biden's base is seen advocating.
However, it could be another quarter before Canadian companies start making deals as they are still cleaning up their balance sheets, said Stuart Titus, CEO of Medical Marijuana Inc.
Among those most pressed to sell, MedMen Enterprises (OTC:MMNFF) Inc and iAnthus Capital Holdings (OTC:ITHUF) Inc, both restructuring to avoid bankruptcy, have valuable licenses and serve markets that can be new opportunities for buyers, Titus said. 
MedMen and iAnthus did not respond to requests for comment.
New players that have been on the sidelines could also step in.

""When it becomes fully legal, expect 'Big Food' and 'Big Agra' to jump in, to a much greater extent than they have so far... they could try and develop their own name brands,"" said William Gay, a lawyer at Wilson Elser Moskowitz Edelman & Dicker LLP.

1562,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 11, 2020 02:18PM ET</span>",‘Stay-at-Home’ Safety Trade Unravels With Big Tech Left Behind,"(Bloomberg) -- An oddity is occurring as the stock market grinds back to an all-time high: Big tech is getting left behind.
A risk-on rotation rippling across markets has the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 flirting with a third straight loss -- which would be its longest slide since March -- as the S&P 500 climbs for an eighth consecutive day and approaches its February record. Meanwhile, the battered Russell 2000 gauge of small caps is staging a comeback, with a jump of more than 12% over the past month.
A string of better-than-expected economic data combined with budding optimism over a coronavirus vaccine has traders ditching the tech-heavy “stay-at-home” trade that drove much of the market’s 50% rally since the March lows.
An index tracking airlines jumped 10% this week, and a Bloomberg basket of stocks that could win during a rebound in activity, including hotels, resorts, cruise companies, is up for a fifth straight day, gaining 14% in that stretch. Meanwhile, a custom gauge of firms that benefit in a lockdown environment and prolonged recovery has lost about 2.5% since Thursday.
“In the past couple of days, you have seen the economically sensitive stock sectors outperform relative to the stay-at-home stocks,” said Brent Schutte, chief investment strategist at Northwestern (NYSE:NWE) Mutual Wealth Management Company. “That has to do a lot with the stimulus that is coming, plus the vaccine and treatment news continues to get better on a daily basis.”
After helping to power the Nasdaq 100’s 27% year-to-date rally, high-flying megatech names such as Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)., Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)., Google’s parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc. and  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB). are coming under pressure. An index of FANG stocks of tech titans has dropped for three straight days -- the longest streak in about three weeks -- and is down about 2.4% since Thursday.
The risk appetite uptick spurred reversals elsewhere across markets. Long-dated Treasury yields climbed after surprisingly strong producer-price figures. Real interest-rates -- which strip out the impact of inflation -- at one point rose by the most since June, after plunging to record lows last week. Meanwhile, gold prices dropped by the most in seven years.
“Given the rise in rates and the recent bounce in the dollar, it seems to be giving growth and gold investors a reason to pause,” said Sameer Samana,  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Investment’s senior global market strategist.

1563,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 11, 2020 02:05PM ET</span>",Rozenberg offer for control of Israel's El Al may struggle to win support of board: source,"By Tova Cohen
TEL AVIV (Reuters) - Eli Rozenberg's bid for a controlling stake in  El Al  Israel Airlines (TA:ELAL) is below the price that can be obtained in a public share offering and may struggle to gain board support, said a source close to the board who declined to be named.
Last month Rozenberg, a U.S. citizen now resident in Israel, offered to funnel $75 million into the airline in return for a 45% stake. Rozenberg is the son of Kenny Rozenberg, chief executive of New York-based nursing home chain Centers Health Care.
""From my talks with members of the board, most are against the proposal,"" the source said. ""Shareholders are opposed to it.""
The source, who asked not to be identified, said Rozenberg's offer was worth only 0.63 shekel ($0.1851) a share, below the 0.71 shekel market price.
""It's better to offer shares to the public at 0.70 shekel,"" the source told Reuters. ""The government would buy shares that aren't bought at 0.67, so there's a safety net.""
Israel's flag carrier, in which Knafaim Holdings (TA:KNFM) is the biggest shareholder with a 38% stake, was hit hard by the coronavirus outbreak and is in advanced negotiations for a government bailout to avoid bankruptcy.
The government offered to back $250 million in bank loans in exchange for El Al issuing $150 million in shares, which the state will buy if no one else does in a public offering.
El Al's board has yet to vote on Rozenberg's offer, which would also need shareholders' approval.
Spokesmen for both El Al and Rozenberg declined to comment.
""I don't see the board taking a decision in favour of this deal,"" said Ilan Arad, vice president of investment at Israeli investment house Yetsira.
Even an improved offer should not be accepted, he said, because transfer of control will not resolve much deeper problems the airline faces, such as not being able to fly on the Jewish Sabbath. 
The heavily indebted airline has a market cap of 350 million shekels.
The source said Rozenberg can still buy shares in the public offering. ""It's a question of him buying at an 'end-of-season sale price', or buying in the offering when the price won't be below 0.67 shekel,"" he said.
El Al, which has reported losses for two years running and racked up debt to renew its fleet, suspended flights when Israel closed its borders and furloughed most of its employees.

1565,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 11, 2020 01:40PM ET</span>","Facing pandemic squeeze, universities hit bond markets for cheap cash","By Yoruk Bahceli
AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Universities, waiting to see how hard the coronavirus pandemic will hit overseas enrolments and government grants, have gone on a borrowing spree in the bond markets this year that outpaces a rise in companies' bond sales.
The COVID-19 crisis is threatening to redefine higher education around the world, with students sent home and classes moved online. But the economic fallout will also hit universities' finances as tuition fees, especially from overseas students, is likely to fall while funding from governments could also be hit.
Yet that has not stopped investors from lending to universities at record-low rates. And the institutions have rushed to capitalise on the availability of cheap funding.
Bond issuance by universities is only a tiny part of the global bond market, but sales by universities worldwide are more than double full-year 2019 levels at $11.4 billion in the year to date, Dealogic data shows.
In comparison, global debt issuance by companies is at around 75% of 2019 volumes, based on Dealogic data.
Graphic: Global bond sales by universities and colleges in 2020 https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/oakpemlzmpr/IzD41-global-bond-sales-by-universities-and-colleges-in-2020.png
""We're seeing a lot of what we call pull-forward issuance,"" as universities brace for another lockdown in autumn, said Fitch analyst Emily Wadwhani, who specialises in higher education finance.
Among those to issue was the AAA-rated University of Virginia, which raised $600 million in July to fund projects such as new dormitories. It paid a 2.256% yield, the lowest ever for a 30-year ""taxable"" university issue.
Taxable corporate debt attracts a broader investor pool than municipal bonds, another source of funding for U.S. universities.
""The market was incredibly advantageous. We have both (current and future) capital needs, but we also thought that given the opportunity to go into the market, we could advance fund,"" J.J. Davis, chief operating officer at the University of Virginia, said.
""At these rates, why wouldn't you?""
While U.S. universities accounted for 24 deals in the year-to-date, based on Dealogic data, institutions from Canada, Brazil, Singapore and Australia also sold bonds.
The market in publicly disclosed university bonds is about $50 billion-plus, according to Dealogic. 
Of this, $36.3 billon is from U.S. universities, which typically get a lower level of state support compared with European peers.
Existing university issues, especially from top-tier names such as Oxford and MIT, have shared in this year's broader bond market rally. Yields on the S&P Municipal Bond Higher Education Index have fallen to 2.7%, near record lows.
'HAVES AND HAVE-NOTS'
The coronavirus crisis may widen the gap between top-tier universities and lesser-known ones. This year's borrowers mostly comprise top-rated names such as Virginia, Harvard and Stanford.
""The market is starting to distinguish between the haves and the have-nots,"" said Cooper Howard, fixed income strategy director at  Charles Schwab  (NYSE:SCHW), which manages $3.25 trillion of assets. 
Credit rating agency Moody's (NYSE:MCO) said in March in a report on U.S. higher education that the outlook for the U.S. education sector was changing to negative from stable.
""For fiscal 2021, universities face unprecedented enrollment uncertainty, risks to multiple revenue streams, and potential material erosion in their balance sheets."" 
Even university issuers with high credit ratings have had to show investors how they will tackle the pandemic hit.
""(Issuers) have done a ton of work around stress-scenario analysis,"" a U.S. banker involved in some of the deals said. 
He said 30-40 universities with lower credit ratings were waiting for clarity on admissions and tuition fees before issuing debt.
British universities, already facing an added Brexit complication, have been absent from fundraising via the bond market this year, though they often favour hard-to-track private placements.
Dialogue around bond financing fell away amid spring uncertainty, said Fraser Dixon, JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM)'s head of UK and Ireland debt capital markets, who arranged Oxford's debut bond deal in 2017.
Financial pressures are increasing. A report from the University and College Union - the union for university staff in Britain - predicted British universities will lose 2.5 billion pounds next year in tuition fees alone.
And in the United States, student enrolments will decline by 5-20% this year, Fitch predicted.
""It's certainly difficult to judge what the university experience might look like in the future,"" JPM's Dixon said.

Airbnb is preparing to potentially go public before the end of the year, the report said, citing sources familiar with the matter. 
An Airbnb spokesman declined to comment. 
Reuters had reported in October that Airbnb was close to hiring  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) and  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) as joint lead advisers on its planned stock market flotation. 
Airbnb last year announced plans to become a publicly listed company in 2020, making it one of the biggest names to pursue a stock market float this year.
The company's plans to go public come at a time when its core home-rental business has been hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has forced millions of people across the world to postpone their travel plans. 

Earlier this year, Airbnb raised $1 billion in funding from private equity firms Silver Lake and Sixth Street Partners.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - China is continuing to buy U.S. goods, particularly commodities, under its Phase 1 trade deal with the United States, despite rising tensions over Hong Kong and other issues, top White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said on Tuesday.
Asked if deteriorating ties between the world's two largest economies on other fronts could result in the trade deal being thrown out the window, Kudlow said, ""No, no."" 
""The one area we are engaging is trade,"" he told reporters at the White House. ""It's fine right now.""
Top U.S. and Chinese officials are due to meet for a ""routine"" video conference on Saturday to assess implementation of the Phase 1 agreement six months after the deal defused a trade war that hurt both nations and the global economy.
Kudlow, the director of the White House's National Economic Council, said China was continuing to implement the deal, which called for Beijing to purchase $77 billion in additional U.S. goods and services this year, and a total of $200 billion in additional purchases over two years.
""The evidence shows ... they've stepped up substantially"" on purchases of U.S. goods, Kudlow said, citing what he called ""really good numbers,"" particularly on commodities.China has increased its purchases of U.S. soybeans recently, but it remains far short of the overall target for 2020. The United States exported just $7.274 billion in agricultural goods to China in the first half of the year, well below the $36.5 billion agreed under the trade deal.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday said his relationship with Chinese President Xi Jinping had soured in the wake of the novel coronavirus pandemic. Trump, who is seeking a second term in the White House in a Nov. 3 election, has repeatedly hammered China for not doing more to contain the virus.

The two countries have also been at odds over Beijing's crackdown in Hong Kong, China's human rights record, and the disputed South China Sea, among other issues.

1573,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 11, 2020 01:00PM ET</span>",Occidental Petroleum to cut debt before boosting oil output: CEO Hollub,"(Reuters) - Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) expects oil and gas output to dip in the second half of the year and will not boost production until it ""significantly"" reduces debt, Chief Executive Vicki Hollub said on Tuesday.
The company has been struggling with debt taken on during its $38 billion acquisition of Anadarko Petroleum (NYSE:APC) last year, an ill-timed bet on oil prices rising. 
The Anadarko purchase was intended to increase efficiency and profits by boosting oil and gas production. But Occidental's output will dip in the third and fourth quarters and it will end the year pumping about 1.2 million barrels of oil and gas per day, about 200,000 barrels per day less than the year prior.
The production outlook ""does not inspire confidence in capital efficiency"" or in the ability to ""meet sustaining capital requirements next year,"" Mizuho Securities USA analyst Vincent Lovaglio said, adding that Occidental needs to finalize a major asset sale.
Occidental did not release 2021 spending plans, but said it would have to spend about $2.9 billion to keep production flat, based on oil prices at $40 per barrel.
It has about $4.5 billion in notes due next year and reported long-term debt of $36 billion on June 30. Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) holds about $9.7 billion in Occidental preferred shares that pay a dividend of about 8%.
Occidental is restarting some activity in the Permian Basin and Gulf of Mexico, but its focus is to ""ensure that we have the liquidity to go forward so we have the ability to meet our maturities,"" Hollub said on a call with analysts.
On Monday it posted an $8.35 billion second-quarter loss amid lower energy prices and writedowns.
The company has returned to the market most of the U.S. barrels it curtailed during the spring oil price crash, Hollub said.
In the third quarter, it is likely to have about 20,000 barrels per day curtailed due to OPEC+ cuts.
Occidental shares dipped 1.8% to $16.17 at midday.

1579,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 11, 2020 11:54AM ET</span>",Boeing 737 Max Return Outside U.S. Seen Slowed by Regulators,"(Bloomberg) -- European and Canadian regulators are still wrangling with Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co. over the last remaining technical details of its 737 Max revamp, leaving some customers to worry that certification in critical markets outside the U.S. could slip to next year.
In a rare bit of good news for Boeing and its beleaguered jet line, the Federal Aviation Administration on Aug. 3 triggered a process that could lead to reissuance of a U.S. airworthiness certificate for the Max as soon as October.
Yet international regulators say they aren’t ready to follow suit. The European Union Aviation Safety Agency is still waiting for more clarity from Boeing on a key update to be carried out after the plane is back in the air, according to people familiar with the matter.
And Transport Canada, it its most detailed comments to date, said Monday that its concerns haven’t been fully addressed about how to quiet erroneous activation of the Max’s “stick shaker,” which can distract pilots and add to their workload in an emergency.
China, the world’s second-biggest aviation market, has meanwhile said very little about its plan to evaluate the Max.
Winning U.S. approval by October might make it possible for commercial flights to occur before year-end. That would allow Boeing to finally start generating revenue again from its most popular model. The Max was grounded in March 2019 following the second of two crashes that killed 346 people.
While the FAA, the Max’s main certifying body, was always expected to be first to clear its return, a significant time gap with Europe or China, for example, could damage the outlook for the jet’s commercial revival. It would also potentially hamstring international airline customers such as Ireland’s Ryanair Holdings (NASDAQ:RYAAY) Plc or tour operator TUI AG, and slow progress toward a top Boeing priority: a return to positive cash flow.
Both Air Lease (NYSE:AL) Corp., one of the largest aircraft leasing companies, and ratings firm Standard & Poor’s have expressed caution about how long it will take for the jet to gain approval to fly again outside the U.S.

International clearances may be delayed “by a few months, due in part to travel restrictions and other logistical issues caused by the coronavirus,” S&P said last week.
Angle of Attack
EASA’s concerns about the 737 Max’s lack of a third angle-of-attack sensor haven’t been fully addressed, said several people familiar with the matter who asked for anonymity discussing private interactions over the plane’s return.
The device, which monitors whether a plane is pointed up or down relative to the oncoming air, malfunctioned in both Max crashes, triggering the automated system that pushed the doomed flights into a dive.
The FAA and EASA clashed last year over how to approach a fix, finally reaching a compromise involving an upgrade to be installed by Boeing after the planes were flying again. The company has proposed using existing sensors and the plane’s computers to synthesize the action of a third angle-of-attack sensor without the expensive hardware addition, according to people familiar with the matter.
EASA is seeking more clarity from Boeing on its timetable for making the revisions after the Max resumes commercial service, including milestones to track progress toward implementation, two people said.
However, one person familiar with discussions on the issue said that this is not expected to hold up EASA’s decision on lifting the flight ban.
Boeing has said it expects the Max to receive FAA clearance during the fourth quarter.
“We continue to make steady progress towards safely returning the airplane to service, working through the rigorous process laid out by the FAA, EASA and other authorities,” Chicago-based Boeing said in a statement. “Safety remains our priority and the regulators will continue to determine the schedule for return to service.”
Last week, the FAA said that Boeing’s redesigned software had “demonstrated compliance” with EASA requirements. But EASA signaled there were still issues to be resolved beyond test-flight scheduling.
“Good progress has been made but there is still some work which Boeing needs to complete,” EASA said, declining to elaborate.
Stick Shaker
Canada too has signaled that it’s not yet comfortable that the changes outlined by the FAA last week go far enough.
The FAA’s proposed fixes, now under a 45-day review period, would ensure that the safety feature that malfunctioned in the crashes, known as the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System, can no longer trigger the repeated dives that brought down the planes. Boeing was also required to use its flight-control computer to compare readings from both angle-of-attack sensors to give pilots more awareness of a failure.
On Monday, Canada reiterated its demand to address the so-called human factor that’s been discussed in the wake of a Max crashes as a potential contributing factor when an array of alarms and warnings can overwhelm pilots and contribute to airliner disasters.
Transport Canada wants to give pilots the option disable the stick shaker -- a warning mechanism that noisily vibrates the plane’s control yoke -- when it has been erroneously triggered. The regulator contends that this would reduce pilot workload and distraction.
As proposed by Boeing, the stick shaker could only be deactivated by pulling a circuit breaker, Livia Belcea, Press Secretary for Transport Minister Marc Garneau, said on Monday. Boeing has been discussing a modification that would be installed after the plane returns to service, Belcea said.
“Transport Canada will not lift the flight restrictions on the Boeing 737 Max 8 until the department is fully satisfied that all safety concerns have been addressed by the manufacturer and the U.S. FAA, and that enhanced flight crew procedures and training are in place,” Belcea said. “If deemed necessary, Transport Canada will require supplementary procedures and training in Canada.”
After Effects
While disagreements between regulators are not unusual, they have played out in a more public way in the wake of the 737 Max crisis. Airline regulators have historically projected a fairly unified front, striving to adopt more uniform rules and only rarely disagreeing on major safety issues. Regulators that oversee jetliner manufacturers -- the EU, the U.S., Canada and Brazil -- are the world’s leaders. That atmosphere was shattered by the Max crisis, which raised questions about the FAA that punctured its reputation as the gold standard in aviation safety.
Regulators have since sought to demonstrate independence. Rising nationalism over trade and other matters hasn’t helped, while the coronavirus also slowed collaboration.
“We hope that FAA certifications of the Max will occur this year,” Air Lease Chief Executive Officer John Plueger said on a post-earnings conference call last week. “We have somewhat less confidence that certification by the end of the year will be achieved by all foreign regulators including EASA and China.”
Brexit, Virus
A long European delay combined with Brexit could potentially cause a headache for TUI, the tour operator with part of its fleet licensed in the U.K. After a temporary transition deal runs out in December, Britain’s Civil Aviation Authority will take over aircraft certification from EASA. The agency is still recruiting technical experts to carry out its own evaluations, according to a person familiar with the matter.
While a decision hasn’t been made on how the agency would handle the Max certification, the CAA would most likely follow along with EASA testing, said the person. This would minimize any additional impact on TUI or other U.K.-licensed carriers.
With much of its fleet still grounded and a focus on travel during warmer months, a certification delay would only have a significant effect on TUI if it couldn’t get its planes back in service by April, TUI CEO Fritz Joussen has said. That’s when the Easter break signals the start of Europe’s travel season.
TUI declined to comment.
In a statement, the CAA said it’s working closely with EASA on the Max and will be ready to take over at the end of the Brexit transition period.
Breathing Room
To be sure, airlines won’t broadly see an impact unless the Max’s comeback drags past winter’s end. The virus has pushed traffic so low that most don’t need the planes right now. And should the differences get sorted within the FAA review period, the gap with the U.S. may be minimal.
For Boeing, which is sitting on some 450 undelivered Max jets, a slower return would hamper its ability to hand the planes over and collect final payments. Some customers, such as Ryanair, have said they’ll try to get delivery schedules accelerated.
Other regions will follow Europe’s lead. Regulators in India, for example, will wait for both the FAA and EASA to recertify the plane before allowing it to fly there, according to a person familiar with the matter.
China Slowdown
China, the second-largest aircraft market, remains a wild card. It was the first country to ground the Max in 2019 and hasn’t said much about how it’s evaluating the return. Political tension has been rising with the U.S. on fronts including a trade deal, freedoms in Hong Kong and data security.
Max customers said they had little insight into the process and expected that the friction was slowing it down. China also hasn’t taken any 787 Dreamliner deliveries this year, which has been taken as a negative sign.
The government bodies primarily responsible for overseeing China’s aviation industry include the National Development and Reform Commission, the Civil Aviation Administration of China, and the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission.
The three agencies didn’t respond to faxed questions about how China will determine the plane’s airworthiness and whether domestic airlines plan to accept deliveries.

In a statement on Tuesday by Stripe, Suryadevara said: ""I really enjoy leading complex, large-scale businesses and I hope to use my skills to help accelerate Stripe’s already steep growth trajectory.""
GM named John Stapleton, currently CFO of North American operations, as acting global finance chief, effective Aug. 15. Stapleton joined GM in 1990 and has held a series of finance roles in the company.
Suryadevara succeeded Chuck Stevens as GM's CFO in September 2018. Before that, she was vice president of corporate finance. She joined GM in 2004 as a senior financial analyst in the Treasurer's Office.

Investing.com -- Pot sales dropped despite a captive audience stuck at home, prompting Tilray (NASDAQ:TLRY) to tumble 12%. 
The company reported a loss per share of 65 cents compared to the expected 33-cent loss on sales of $50.4 million versus the forecasted $54.8 million.
Rivals  Canopy Growth  (NYSE:CGC) and Aurora Cannabis (NYSE:ACB) fell 1.7% and 1%, respectively. 
At Tilray, revenue rose 10% in the second quarter from a year earlier, and was down 3.2% from the first quarter, dragged down by its adult use, Canada medical and hemp sales divisions. International Medical sales jumped 43%, partially offsetting the weaker segments. 
Tilray blamed falling sales on Covid-19, the closure of stores in Ontario, changes in purchasing behavior and a limited number of retail locations added in the quarter. 
Tilray went public in 2018 at $17 a piece. Within two months, shares had soared to more than $143, and have been on a downward trajectory since, trading Tuesday at around $7 a share.
Shares have one buy rating, six holds and no sells, with an average price target of $8.70, according to analysts tracked by Investing.com.

Investing.com --  Words with Friends game maker Zynga (NASDAQ:ZNGA) dropped 6% after a downgrade by Berenberg. 
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s ad policy change -- developers now need to ask for user consent to turn on Ïdentifier for Advertisers, formerly a default setting -- will hurt Zynga, Seeking Alpha said, citing analyst David Beckel. 
Beckel cut the game company to hold from buy, and lowered the price target to $10.50 from $11, Seeking Alpha said.  
Last week, Zynga reported record sales for its second quarter, with revenue of $518 million comparing to the expected $504 million. Earnings per share of 10 cents beat the 8-cent forecast.
In July, shares hit their highest since 2012. The stock is up 45% since the start of 2020.

1585,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 11, 2020 10:36AM ET</span>","Virus Worsens the U.S. Gender Pay Gap, With Women Losing Out","(Bloomberg) -- The coronavirus pandemic will likely make the gender pay gap worse as the U.S. economy recovers but could ultimately improve opportunities for women, according to a paper distributed by the National Bureau of Economic Research.
In a regular recession, the pay gap between men and women shrinks by two percentage points as men tend to get hit harder by job losses, according to the paper published this month. But in a pandemic recession, that gap increases by five percentage points, the report said.
Women are more vulnerable to the economic effects of the Covid-19 pandemic because they are more likely then men to work in service industries, which have been hit especially hard in recent months. With so many schools and daycares closed, many of the additional childcare responsibilities have also fallen to women. Females lose skills when they leave the workforce, either because of job loss or to care for children, which results in lower pay when they return, according to NBER.
Sending young children back to school will do the most to improve the gender wage gap, according to the report. The findings come as school districts around the country mull whether or not to start in-person classes in the fall.
Still, in the long term, the pandemic may offer some opportunities to ultimately shrink pay gaps by shifting social norms and increasing telework, the researchers said. During the pandemic, men are sharing more of the childcare work and other household responsibilities traditionally held by women, according to the report’s findings. But it may still take “many years” to make up for the skills women are losing while they are out of work, the paper said.

1588,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 11, 2020 10:00AM ET</span>","Exclusive: Indian craft brewer Bira talking to foreign beer makers about possible stake sale, says CEO","By Aditya Kalra, Anirban Sen and Ritsuko Ando
NEW DELHI/BENGALURU/TOKYO (Reuters) - India's B9 Beverages, maker of popular craft beer Bira, is in talks with international brewers and investors to sell a stake of up to 20% in the company, its chief executive told Reuters on Tuesday.
""We've been looking for a combination: (an) international beer company as a strategic investor and a separate financial partner,"" CEO Ankur Jain said in a phone interview, adding that the company was in the ""intermediate stage"" of raising funds.
""We've been talking to beer companies that are not competitive in India or have minimal operations in India.""
Data provider PitchBook estimates New Delhi-based Bira was valued at $210 million in 2018. U.S.-based Sequoia Capital holds a roughly 45% stake in the company, while CEO Jain and his family own around 30%.
Jain declined to name the companies with which it is in talks, but four industry sources said Bira had been in talks with Kirin Holdings (T:2503), one of Japan's biggest beer makers which has limited sales in India.
A Kirin spokesman said there was ""absolutely no discussion at the moment"" on taking a stake in Bira. Last week Kirin cut its full-year profit outlook due to the COVID-19 impact and said it would avoid ""non-essential"" investments.
A Kirin source said the company sees India as a growth market and that it has looked at Bira, but that it was part of a broader study into global markets.
One of the Indian industry sources said that Bira and Kirin had discussed a deal which would also allow the Japanese brewer to offer its brands directly - which include Kirin Lager and Ichiban Shibori - in India's estimated $7 billion beer market.
Kirin has in the past shown interest in independent breweries and owns a minority stake in New York's Brooklyn Brewery.
Bira, launched in 2015, is one of the smallest players in India, but its craft beer offerings have become increasingly popular. Jain said Bira had a 5-10% share of the beer market in New Delhi, Mumbai and Bengaluru.
India's beer market is dominated by companies like  United Breweries  (NS:UBBW),  Anheuser-Busch InBev  (BR:ABI) and Carlsberg (CO:CARLb), according to IWSR Drinks Market Analysis.
FINANCIAL LOSSES, IPO
An investment from Kirin or other investors would help Bira which has made losses in recent years and been hit by the coronavirus pandemic, just like the rest of the beer industry. It has said it aims eventually to list on the stock market.
""Bira is really struggling financially at the moment and they badly need a lifeline. A deal with Kirin or any of the other global strategic companies would give them that,"" said one of the Indian industry sources.
Bira clocked $24.5 million in sales in the fiscal year ending March 2019, 15% higher than the previous year, but its net loss for the period doubled to $27 million.
Results for the year through March 2020 have not yet been released but CEO Jain said sales grew by 40% in that fiscal year and that the company's results in recent years were in line with its growth plans.
In 2018 the CEO said the company would target a stock market listing in 3-5 years, but the timelines have stretched since then.

""Our intended plan is to do an IPO, the timelines have been stretched due to realigned corporate plans as we want larger scale before we go to market,"" Jain said.

Over the last four years Mediaset - controlled by the family of former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi - and the French media group have been embroiled in a legal battle which stemmed from a failed pay-TV sale.
The row intensified last year when Mediaset approved a plan to merge its Italian and Spanish (MC:TL5) businesses under a Dutch holding company, through which it wants to build pan-European alliances.
But opposition from Vivendi, which says the holding's governance structure would strengthen the Berlusconis' grip over the group, led to the project being suspended by a Madrid court.
Mediaset declined to comment. Vivendi was not immediately available to comment.

Karen Parkin stepped down in June after a group of employees called for an investigation over her handling of racism at the company which she had described last year as ""noise"" only discussed in America.
Rorsted, speaking at Adidas's annual shareholder meeting which was held online, was asked by a shareholder if sales had been affected by the complaints.
""We haven't seen our customers shunning purchases,"" he said.
Adidas has said that it has not given enough credit in the past to the many prominent Black athletes and celebrities - like James Harden and Kanye West - as well as Black employees and consumers who have helped to make it successful.
Rorsted said on Tuesday that employees had told him there were not enough equal opportunities for all at the company: ""That is not acceptable. So it's a priority for us to make Adidas an even more diverse and inclusive company.""
Adidas has reopened four stores damaged during U.S. protests over the police killing of George Floyd and plans to reopen a fifth, Rorsted told the meeting.
He said the company was not dealing with any legal complaints connected with the race issue.

Adidas said last week it expected sales to recover and profitability to bounce back in the third quarter assuming there are no new major lockdowns as it benefits from more people exercising and dressing down as they work from home.

1592,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 11, 2020 07:45AM ET</span>","More cash, less buzz for 2020 investment bank interns","By Elizabeth Howcroft
LONDON (Reuters) - Buzzing trading floors, classrooms and networking drinks have been replaced by online projects, 'hackathons' and fitness sessions for the class of 2020 investment banking interns.
Goldman Sachs (N:GS),  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS),  Barclays  (L:BARC), JP Morgan (N:JPM), UBS (S:UBSG),  RBC  (TO:RY) and Citi (N:C) have all held internships virtually this year as they adapt to the restrictions imposed by the coronavirus pandemic. 
Schmoozing with executives and fellow interns has been via virtual coffees and quizzes, while Goldman Sachs laid on Zoom networking lunches, hackathons and fitness and cooking classes. 
""We couldn't have big parties or anything like that but we did work with a music start-up – there was a battle of the bands competition where the interns could vote,"" Helena Sharpe, JP Morgan's head of campus recruiting for EMEA, said. 
Although many of the highly sought after schemes were cut to 5 weeks from the usual 8 or 10, most interns lucky enough to secure a place still received full pay while working from home.
Investment bank interns in London are usually paid around 10,000 pounds ($13,034) for a 10-week programme, financial careers website efinancialcareers.co.uk estimates. 
Such internships offer the potential to kick start lucrative banking careers, but have come under scrutiny in the past for the long hours some students work in their effort to impress. 
""Some of them probably still work relatively long days because they want to make a good impression and do the best they can on their projects,"" Sharpe said. 
How well virtual internships work-out is being closely watched by banks assessing the long-term future of remote working, particularly for new joiners, with Barclays and RBC considering keeping some elements for future programmes.
Banks have supplied the necessary kit for working from home. Goldman Sachs, which had around 380 interns in Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA), even sent electricity generators to those who needed them. ""It's one big experiment, but it feels great and the feedback's been very positive,"" Rob Ager, head of programmatic talent acquisition at Barclays, adding that although ""authenticity"" could get lost in the virtual world, working from home had created a more collaborative culture. 
'BUZZ AND VIBE' 
There are limitations to the work banks can offer this year, with interns at JP Morgan working on case studies and projects rather than on placements within teams, while Morgan Stanley offered business simulations and work-related projects. 
At Barclays, there were two weeks of classroom learning, and while some parts involved a real-life teacher others required watching videos on an online portal. 
""You can't really get the full buzz and vibe of the trading floor in a virtual setting, which is a bit disappointing,"" an intern at one firm who asked not to be named said. 
""I don’t think you get the true feel of work when you're working from home and for me personally it would be easier to network in person and get to know people more genuinely.""
But working virtually has made interns less competitive with each other and more willing to help, the intern said, adding they were able to call each other to ask questions. 
Citi has guaranteed all of its around 200 London interns a graduate job offer for 2021 so long as they meet the minimum requirements, easing the competitive dynamic. 
For staff supervising the programmes, the virtual internship is not without challenges. 
""I have to describe things over email and stuff or get on Zoom calls and all of these things that are just easier if it's done live,"" an associate at a U.S. investment bank said.
And while it is harder to monitor interns remotely, banks say they do their best to ensure hours are kept in check. 
""We do encourage them to have a good work life balance and take regular breaks,"" JP Morgan's Sharpe said.

TOKYO (Reuters) - SoftBank Group Corp broke with tradition on Tuesday and declined to disclose operating profit in its quarterly results, saying the measure was ""not useful"" to gauge performance, and instead pointed to a $2.8 billion gain at its Vision Fund.
Chief Executive Masayoshi Son has long emphasised the total value of assets as his preferred yardstick. By jettisoning operating profit, however, SoftBank could further stoke investor complaints about a firm long seen as opaque and hard to value.
SoftBank, which plunged to a record operating loss last year following writedowns at the Vision Fund, trumpeted a 297 billion yen ($2.80 billion) investment gain in April-June driven by the sell-down of assets and upwards revaluation of its portfolio.
The cheer was contained, however, as Son - known for unflagging optimism - cast business in the COVID-19 era in martial terms and said SoftBank was taking a defensive tack.
""Every day is like a war,"" he told an earnings briefing. ""Cash is the defence for us.""
Underscoring the new conservatism, Son said he and SoftBank are placing $555 million in a unit investing in liquid stocks such as Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) - a break from his recent emphasis on betting big on fast-growing unlisted start-ups.
VALUATIONS
Analysts had expected SoftBank to report a first-quarter operating profit, after booking three consecutive quarters of loss. Instead, SoftBank omitted the figure, rejecting it as a measure of the performance of an investment firm.
It reported a 12% rise in April-June net profit at 1.3 trillion yen and said the value of assets had risen since March.
The Japanese conglomerate provides little detail on how it calculates valuations. For April-June gains, it pointed to sectors including e-commerce and food delivery growing during the coronavirus outbreak. 
SoftBank is benefiting from a global rally in technology stocks and demand for listings, with portfolio firm Lemonade Inc making its debut in July and BigCommerce Holdings Inc's shares popping on launch last week.
Son said he is looking at options for chip designer Arm including a partial or total sale and relisting. Arm has turned money-losing under his watch, with losses deepening in the April-June quarter.
ASSET SALES
SoftBank said the Vision Fund trimmed stakes in four listed portfolio companies in April-June and exited three unlisted companies. It did not identify the companies.
Its stakes in nine public companies, including the recently listed Relay Therapeutics Inc, are worth $14.6 billion, compared with their $9.9 billion acquisition cost.
Even so, at the end of June, Vision Fund's $75.2 billion investment in 86 startups was worth $71.5 billion.
SoftBank also recorded gains on the sell-down of assets such as wireless carrier T-Mobile US (NASDAQ:TMUS) Inc following its merger with peer Sprint.
The firm has raised 4.3 trillion yen through asset sales, meeting 95% of its target. It has been using the proceeds for a massive share buy-back plan which has helped its share price rise 140% from its March lows.
The stock ended Tuesday down 2.5% ahead of the earnings announcement, versus a 1.9% rise in the benchmark Nikkei index.

Net profit was 1.72 billion baht ($55 million) in the April-June quarter, compared with 111.5 million baht in the same period a year ago. Sales rose 2.6% to 33.1 billion baht, led by its ambient seafood business, the company said in a statement to the Thai exchange Tuesday. Thai Union said it set aside about 1.4 billion baht to settle its legal case in the same quarter in 2019, which also had tax implications.

Rolls-Royce said on Tuesday that the issue would not cause significant customer disruption or material cost, as it affected a small number of XWBs of a certain age.
The Trent XWB-84 engine is set to be subject to an Airworthiness Directive from regulator EASA, Rolls said, because of wear on a small number of Intermediate Pressure Compressor blades found on a minority of engines which have been in service for four to five years. 
None of those engines have experienced abnormal in-flight operation, it said, adding that it would carry out inspections on all Trent XWB-84s of a similar service life as a precaution. There are just over 100 of them. 
""Given the limited scale of additional work which we anticipate will be required at existing shop visits to address this wear, together with the availability of replacement parts and spare engines, we do not expect this issue to create significant customer disruption or material annual cost,"" Rolls said in a statement. 
Problems with its Trent 1000 engine which powers the Boeing (NYSE:BA) 787 airliner are expected to cost Rolls-Royce 2.4 billion pounds ($3.1 billion) to fix over a 2017-2023 period.
Rolls recently said it was considering strengthening its finances to help it withstand the pandemic.

LONDON (Reuters) - British insurer  Prudential  (L:PRU) said on Tuesday it planned to spin off its U.S. business Jackson to focus on Asia and Africa, as its adjusted operating profit fell 3% in the first half.
A minority initial public offering of Jackson is planned for the first half of 2021, with ""full divestment over time"", Prudential said in a statement.
Prudential's shares jumped 4% as investors cheered news of the exit plan, after many had urged the company to follow in the footsteps of fellow insurers  Standard Life  (LON:SLA) and Old Mutual, which have both split up their operations in recent years. 
Prudential spun off its European funds unit M&G last year.
Reuters reported earlier this year that Prudential was considering a divestment of Jackson.
Pressure had built on the insurer after U.S. hedge fund Third Point (NYSE:TPRE) took a more than $2 billion stake earlier this year and called on management to split the company in two.
The insurer sold a minority equity stake in Jackson to Apollo Global-backed Athene Holding (NYSE:ATH) for $500 million in June, in the first phase of its plan to create an independent U.S. business. 
""The separation and divestment of Jackson would transform Prudential into a Group purely targeting the structural opportunities of Asia and Africa,"" Prudential CEO Mike Wells, a former boss of Jackson, said.
Analysts at Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) said a disposal of Jackson would reduce the risk premium currently applied to Prudential, reitrating their hold rating.
Operating profit came in at $2.5 billion, above a forecast of $2.4 billion, according to a company-compiled consensus forecast.
Asia's operating profit was up 14%, but Jackson's profit fell 19%.
Prudential said it was introducing a new dividend policy, aligned to growth in the Asia and Africa businesses.

It said it would pay an interim dividend of 5.37 cents per share, one-third of its expected full-year 2020 dividend.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - China's Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) will be under pressure to address concerns on the impact of a U.S. ban on WeChat-related transactions and outline its plans to mitigate any fallout as it reports second-quarter results on Wednesday.
The ban, to take effect in September and the latest salvo in a worsening U.S.-China standoff, has cast a shadow over Tencent that aims to eventually get about half its gaming revenue from overseas, versus 23% as of last year. The United States would be key to such a plan as it is the No.2 gaming market after China.
Tencent shares plunged more than 10% within hours on Friday after news of the ban, knocking as much as $74 billion off the tech giant's market value.
""The order as written is so broad that it could end up blocking the ability of any U.S. person or company from working with Tencent,"" said Dan Wang, analyst with Gavekal Dragonomics.
So far, Asia's largest gaming and social media firm has said it is reviewing the potential consequences. Financial markets and millions of consumers will be seeking more clarity when Tencent unveils its April-June results.
Tencent is expected to post a 27% jump in revenue to 112.76 billion yuan ($16.22 billion) and a 14% higher profit, Refinitiv data shows, on strong demand from users stuck at home due to coronavirus-related curbs.
Its subsidiary U.S.-listed Tencent Music has reported better-than-expected quarterly results.
The unit said it was ""premature"" to speculate over a potential delisting, in response to a question on if it had a plan to react to a recommendation from the Trump administration on auditing U.S.-listed Chinese firms.
It did not comment on the WeChat ban.
U.S. EXPOSURE
Downloads of apps seen as alternatives to WeChat surged in the United States last week. 
First-time installs of QQ, an older Tencent messaging app, jumped 220% for the week of Aug. 3 versus the prior week, while downloads of Japan's Line rose 340%, according to analytics firm SensorTower. 
It was not clear whether the sanction would affect other U.S. holdings of Tencent, which recently opened two studios in Los Angeles with an aim to create content with original intellectual property that has global appeal.
Tencent's current revenue exposure to the United States is less than 3% and earnings exposure under 5%, according to China Renaissance analyst Alex Liu. 
Beijing has vowed to defend the rights and interests of Chinese businesses pressured by the United States, but analyst Chelsey Tam of Morningstar said this could hurt Tencent.
Tencent publishes U.S. video games in the mainland and would be hit if China stops approving the monetization of these American games, she said.

""We think taking the U.S. government to court is also an option for Tencent and could overturn or delay the implementation of the orders.""

1600,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 11, 2020 05:25AM ET</span>",StockBeat: Vestas Lives up to Stretched Expectations,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- Few European stocks embody the way Europe likes to think of itself like  Vestas Wind  Systems A/S (CSE:VWS), the world’s largest maker of wind turbines: green, high-tech and still profitable, even after the ravages of the Covid-19 pandemic.
That profile has made it the default stock of choice for the growing hordes of ESG fund managers who are receiving investment mandates faster than they can find suitable companies to invest in (Boohoo, anyone?).
The wall of ESG-themed money hitting green energy stocks has inevitably raised expectations of the renewable energy sector – which has depended for most of its young life on heavy government subsidy – to deliver. As such, there was a lot riding on the Danish company’s second-quarter numbers, which it released on Tuesday.
The reaction has been sighs of relief all round. The company stayed profitable but the best news was in its forward-looking information. The company reintroduced its guidance for the year at a level that was above analyst expectations, after posting a healthy rise in order backlogs. Vestas’ reinstated revenue guidance at the same level as before the pandemic, at between 14 and 15 billion euros. Expectations of an EBIT margin between 5% and 7% are only down slightly from beforehand.
Even better, the order backlog hit an all-time high of 35.1 billion euros, up 11% from a year earlier.
Like Airbus (PA:AIR) and Boeing (NYSE:BA), Vestas works in a world of long lead times. Wind farms take years to progress from the planning stage to commissioning. That makes the size and reliability of the order book more important than current profitability, especially when uncertainty is high, like at present.
Over half of the backlog – some 18.9 billion euros – is revenue expected from servicing existing installations, rather than from deliveries of new ones. That's important because it shows how the company is insulating itself almost naturally from the volatile business of manufacturing. As wind power spreads across the world, the stock of existing installations becomes more economically important than incremental ones.
Investors reacted by pushing Vestas’ stock price up 8.6% to a new all-time high. It’s now up 37% for 2020.
Like that of its Danish customer Oersted A/S (CSE:ORSTED), the world’s largest wind farm operator, Vestas’ stock now commands a painfully high premium for the economic and environmental sustainability of its business model. According to Investing.com data, it trades at 37 times trailing earnings (Oersted is at at 43x). A dividend yield of 1% is nothing to shout about, and there is no chance of it being raised in the near term.
But as long as the ESG boom continues – global assets under management doubled to $40.5 trillion in the last four years, according to research firm Opimas – all Vestas' winds are tailwinds."
1601,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 11, 2020 04:55AM ET</span>","World stocks rise, markets bet on U.S. Congress stimulus deal","By Sujata Rao
LONDON (Reuters) - World stocks inched to 5-1/2 month highs on Tuesday, lifted by bets a U.S. fiscal stimulus package will be reached and by signs Sino-U.S. tensions have eased ahead of a crucial round of trade talks. 
While investors took cheer from an order from President Donald Trump restoring some enhanced unemployment payments and suspending payroll taxes, the mood is watchful as sparring continues in the U.S. Congress over extending fiscal stimulus.
Economic data worldwide also remains a cause for concern, the latest being a steep drop in exports from trade bellwether South Korea and Britain seeing its biggest job losses since 2009.
But Brent crude futures stayed close to five-month highs (LCOc1) and the dollar index held at a one-week high (=USD) after U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said he was optimistic a bipartisan stimulus deal will be reached soon.
Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) analysts said markets were shrugging off doubts over the legality of Trump's order and appeared convinced Congress would agree a deal
""Not without good reason, because in the election campaign both parties have an interest in presenting themselves well,"" they said.
""Who wants to be seen as the stingy bad guy even in times of great need?""
A pan-European share index rose almost 1% (STOXX), with auto shares leading the way after a surge in Chinese car sales and futures tipped a stronger Wall Street (ESc1) open.
MSCI's global equity index rose 0.4% (MIWD00000PUS) while a benchmark of Asian shares outside Japan (MIAPJ0000PUS) gained nearly 1%. Japan's Nikkei (N225) climbed 1.9%. 
The world index is now a whisker off February record peaks.

There are also hopes Beijing's sanctions on 11 U.S. citizens - a response to U.S. sanctions on Chinese individuals over the Hong Kong crackdown - may end this round of tit-for-tat moves between the two powers.
""It has left the White House untouched,"" said Vishnu Varathan, head of economics at Mizuho Bank in Singapore.
""That gives some relief that China is still giving some priority to the (trade deal) dialogue,"" he said. 
U.S. and Chinese officials hold talks on Saturday to review the first six months of the Phase 1 trade deal. While China is lagging targets on energy and farm goods purchases from the United States, markets seem confident trade ties will be insulated from the diplomatic noise.
Such optimism kept safe haven assets under gentle pressure, with gold  and other precious metals down 1%-3% on the day while 10-year U.S. Treasury yields (US10YT=RR) were near a two-week high of 0.5870%. 
Mainland Chinese shares were the exception, dragged some 1% lower by jitters before the talks and weaker tech shares, following the U.S. Nasdaq drop the previous day (SSEC) (CSI300) 
Jason Borbora-Sheen, portfolio manager at Ninety One Asset Management, said headlines would generate oscillations, but the issue did not pose serious risks ""from an equity perspective or from a corporate perspective, simply because that issue has been at the forefront of investors (minds)"". 
ONWARDS AND UPWARDS
Tuesday's gains follow a robust Wall Street session when the Dow (DJI) and S&P500 (SPX) rose and investors rotated towards value stocks and out of tech, reflecting optimism over the growth outlook.
The S&P 500 sits less than 1% below a February record high hit in February, while Asian ex-Japan shares are within 2% of a January peak.
On the currency markets, the euro-dollar flatlined (EUR=EBS). The euro is down 1.6% over the last three sessions as its 10% rally since March loses steam.
One factor underpinning the dollar's decline - and equity strength - is the declining real, or inflation-adjusted, Treasury yield. 
But in a danger signal for the euro-dollar rally, German real yields seem to have caught up with U.S. peers as euro zone inflation expectations have risen. 
Risk-sensitive currencies, such as the Australian and New Zealand dollars, firmed    and Asian gains lifted an emerging currency index almost 2%. 
Even the battered Turkish lira inched up after four lossmaking sessions <.MIEM00000PUS> .

The pan-European STOXX 600 index (STOXX) rose 1.6%, led again by a rally in sectors more exposed to economic swings like travel and leisure (SXTP), miners (SXPP) and energy firms (SXEP).
Automakers (SXAP) surged 3.1% after data showed China's auto sales climbed 16.4% in July, the fourth straight month of gains as the world's biggest vehicle market comes off lows hit during coronavirus lockdown.
Improving economic data in Europe, hopes of more stimulus and a vaccine for the COVID-19 have put the STOXX 600 on course for strong gains in August despite souring U.S.-China relations and uncertainty over the 2020 U.S. presidential election.
""There has been a decent tick-up in economic growth momentum, and earnings for some of the cyclical sectors have come in better than expected,"" said Paul Danis, chief global strategist at wealth manager Brewin Dolphin (OTC:BDNHF).
""There is a good reason to believe that some of the beaten-down value names could pick up. But it does make sense to have bias for the mega-cap growth names.""
Positive earnings also added to the mood, with German online fashion retailer  Zalando SE  (DE:ZALG) rising 3.4% after reporting a more than doubling of sales on its site.
Meal-kit delivery firm HelloFresh (DE:HFGG), whose shares have more than doubled in value this year, rose 2.8% after it raised its full-year guidance.

BP fired technician Scott Tracey from its Kwinana refinery in January 2019 for breaching its code of conduct after he posted a video to a staff Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) group using a widely used clip from the movie Der Untergang (Downfall), showing Hitler ranting on the brink of losing World War Two. 
Tracey appealed, and the Fair Work Commission (FWC) ruled earlier this year that he had been unfairly dismissed, paving the way for him to return to work. And in May, BP lost an appeal in the Federal Court against the FWC ruling.
The FWC, on Monday, awarded Tracey A$201,394 to cover lost earnings.
In a statement on Tuesday BP said it was reviewing the FWC decision. 
The video, which the company had said it considered ""highly offensive and inappropriate"", had captions showing Hitler as an unnamed BP manager enraged about workers rejecting a pay deal. 
Tracey had posted the video on a Facebook page for BP's refinery employees and shared it with some workmates.
The Australian Workers Union (AWU), which represented Tracey, welcomed the latest FWC decision.
""While it doesn't make up for the completely unnecessary drama and heartache Mr. Tracey has been dragged through, we are satisfied with the Commission's ruling,"" AWU Western Australia Secretary Brad Gandy said in a statement.
""In addition to winning the appeal and successfully gaining back our member's job, we have now secured the money our member deserves.""

At their height, shares rose 668.6% to HK$1.96 on Tuesday. They retreated to around HK$1.50, but still led gains on the Hong Kong bourse as the third most actively traded stock. Since the close on Friday, they have gained more 2,078%.
Police on Monday detained Lai, along with other executives of his media company in the highest-profile arrest under a national security law imposed by Beijing, which critics say crushes freedoms in Hong Kong.
Pro-democracy activists have started a campaign to encourage buyers for Next Digital shares and for the Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Daily anti-government tabloid it publishes. 
More than half a million copies of the paper were published on Tuesday, up from the usual 100,000. Buyers queued in the early hours and vendors had to re-order issues before the morning commute time.
One post on a local forum used by pro-democracy supporters said: ""Freedom is priceless, use $$ to support Jimmy Lai.""
Next Digital's market value has risen from HK$197.7 million ($25.42 million) early on Monday to HK$5.17 billion ($666.71 million).
The media group said in a bourse filing its operations have continued normally and it did not expect the arrests to impact its financial position.

Heathrow, which is owned by a group of investors including Spain's Ferrovial (MC:FER), the Qatar Investment Authority and China Investment Corp, said 60% of Heathrow's route network remained grounded, requiring passengers to quarantine for 14 days on arrival.
Despite thousands of Britons holidaying overseas after months of lockdown, the government has already reimposed quarantine on arrivals from Spain, Luxembourg, Belgium, the Bahamas and Andorra.
Last week finance minister Rishi Sunak said the government would not hesitate to add more countries to its quarantine list when asked whether France could also join it.
However, Heathrow believes airport testing of passengers could safely keep routes open and restart others to help the UK's economic recovery.
""Tens of thousands of jobs are being lost because Britain remains cut off from critical markets such as the U.S., Canada and Singapore,"" said Heathrow CEO John Holland-Kaye.
""The government can save jobs by introducing testing to cut quarantine from higher risk countries, while keeping the public safe from a second wave of COVID.""

Over 860,000 passengers travelled through Heathrow in July - down 88% on the previous year, but a slight uplift in traffic since the start of the pandemic, driven by the UK government's creation of the first ""travel corridors"" on July 4.

Jamie Dimon, chief executive of JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM),  IBM  (N:IBM) CEO Arvind Krishna and Accenture (N:ACN) CEO Julie Sweet will co-chair the group.

Floyd died in May after a white police officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes.
The protests also came as minorities were disproportionately represented in coronavirus deaths, and lower-income communities in the United States were hit hard economically.

Tencent reportedly offered to buy 30 million shares of Huya (NYSE:HUYA) from itself, a part-owner of the company. Tencent will also seek control of the final entity, which would allow the WeChat operator to dominate the $3.4 billion Chinese live-stream gaming market.
Tencent’s Hong Kong shares rose 3.19% to HK$518 ($66.8352) by 12:44 AM ET (5:44 AM GMT), regaining some of losses sustained after U.S. President Donald Trump put the kibosh on U.S. transactions with the WeChat owner during the previous week.
There are also fears that the U.S. could start delisting more Chinese companies after U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Monday that companies from China and elsewhere could be delisted from U.S. stock exchanges as of the end of 2021 if they do not comply with accounting standards.

But the number of global cases reached a grim milestone as it topped 20 million as of August 11, according to Johns Hopkins University data.
In China, the National Bureau of Statistics said on Monday that factory deflation eased in July, reporting that the consumer price index rose 2.7% and 0.6% year-on-year and month-on-month respectively.
More data, including industrial production and retail sale figures for July, are set to be released on Friday.
But some investors warned that improving indicator figures are only a part of the whole recovery picture.
“The nature of the activity rebound will depend on the path of the outbreak, delivery of policy response and potential changes to consumer and corporate behaviors,” BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) Investment Institute strategists, led by Global Chief Investment Strategist Mike Pyle, said in a note.
“Success will not just be about restarting the economy and containing the virus. We are moderately pro-risk.”
China’s Shanghai Composite was up 0.33% by 11:32 PM ET (4:32 AM GMT) and the Shenzhen Component rose 0.41%.
Meanwhile, investors are keeping an eye on simmering U.S.-China tensions, after China imposed sanctions on 11 U.S. citizens in response to the U.S. imposition of sanctions on 11 Chinese officials and their allies in Hong Kong on Friday.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index jumped by 2.24%. despite the city’s Chief Executive Carrie Lam’s inclusion on Friday’s list. Japan’s Nikkei 225 and South Korea’s KOSPI both rose 1.71%.
Down Under, the ASX 200 rose 1%."

Mnuchin and other officials recommended the move to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission last week to ensure that Chinese firms are held to the same standards as U.S. companies, prompting China to call for frank dialogue.
Mnuchin told a White House briefing the SEC was expected to adopt the recommendations. ""As of the end of next year ... they all have to comply with the same exact accounting, or they will be delisted on the exchanges,"" he said.
The recommendation is part of a push by the Trump administration to correct what it calls major imbalances in ties between the world's two largest economies. Tensions between the two countries have flared in past months over China's handling of the coronavirus outbreak, Hong Kong and human rights.
U.S. President Donald Trump said China was also failing to meet its commitments to buy more U.S. goods under a Phase 1 trade deal signed in January, although he said purchases should increase next year.
""We did a Phase 1 deal and it was a wonderful deal, and all of a sudden it means very little in the overall import of things,"" Trump told reporters.
He said increased purchases of U.S. goods required under the trade deal would ""never pay for the loss of life in our country and all over the world.""
Trump also repeated his calls for the World Trade Organization to stop treating China as a developing country, arguing that doing so gave Beijing unfair advantages over the United States and other countries.

China argues the classification is justified since many of its regions are still developing.

The pandemic has ravaged the business of many retailers that were forced to shut shops to curb the virus from spreading, and driven quite a few to bankruptcy, including brands such as Brooks Brothers and J.C. Penney that Simon houses. 
With lockdown restrictions now easing, some retailers are witnessing a recovery, Chief Executive Officer David Simon said, adding that shoppers' response to reopened malls was encouraging. Currently, all of Simon's U.S. malls have reopened, except for seven that were recently closed in California.
""We've been generally encouraged ... particularly in certain locations where there's been a steady improvement in traffic with many tenants reporting sales better than their initial expectations."" 
Simon also said he would not comment on market speculations following a report by the Wall Street Journal that online retail giant Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) and Simon were in talks to convert some stores in malls into distribution hubs. 
""More and more retailers are distributing their e-commerce orders from their stores... they're fulfilling from their stores. That's a good trend in long term for us."" 
For the second quarter ended June 30, Simon's total revenue fell 24% to $1.06 billion. The company said it has collected about 51% of its contractual rent billed for April and May combined, about 69% for June and about 73% for July from its U.S. retail portfolio.
Net income attributable to the company's shareholders nearly halved to $254.2 million, or 83 cents per share. 

Analysts were expecting the company to earn 98 cents per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

Occidental, which borrowed heavily to finance last year's $38 billion purchase of rival Anadarko Petroleum (NYSE:APC), cut the value of its oil and gas properties by $6.6 billion, joining BP (NYSE:BP),  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) and Total in massive write-downs as the industry now expects energy prices to stay low for years.
Its oil and gas production will fall 13% this quarter over last, and another 5% in the fourth quarter, to 1.16 million barrels of oil and gas per day, the company said. In the Permian, where it became the largest operator through the Anadarko purchase, shale output will drop 37% this year, it said. 
Shares fell nearly 6% in late trading after rising $1.03 at $16.48. The stock is down 61% so far this year. 
The average price Occidental received for crude oil plummeted about 61% to $23.17 per barrel in the second quarter as oil prices crashed. It has cut jobs, slashed its dividend, reduced spending plans and sold assets to shore up its finances. 
It expects to receive $2 billion or more in asset sales, according to the presentation.
Among the assets Occidental is trying to sell is a package of land and minerals in Wyoming and Colorado. The company has said that it hopes to close that sale in the fourth quarter.
Its net loss was $8.35 billion, or $9.12 per share, in the quarter, compared with earnings of $635 million, or 84 cents per share, a year earlier.

Excluding one-time items, the company lost $1.76 per share, compared with analysts' average estimates of $1.68, according to Refinitiv IBES.

1616,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 10, 2020 06:05PM ET</span>","Judge blocks Uber, Lyft from classifying drivers as contractors in California","By Jonathan Stempel
(Reuters) - A California judge on Monday granted the state's request for a preliminary injunction blocking  Uber Technologies Inc  (N:UBER) and  Lyft  Inc (O:LYFT) from classifying their drivers as independent contractors rather than employees.
The ruling by Judge Ethan Schulman of San Francisco Superior Court is a defeat for the ride-hailing companies, as they defend against a May 5 lawsuit by state Attorney General Xavier Becerra and the cities of Los Angeles, San Diego and San Francisco.
Uber and Lyft had been accused of violating Assembly Bill 5 (""AB5""), a new state law requiring companies to classify workers as employees if they controlled how workers did their jobs, or the work was part of their normal business. 
In a 34-page decision faulting the money-losing companies' ""prolonged and brazen refusal"" to comply with state law, Schulman said the plaintiffs showed an ""overwhelming likelihood"" they could prove Uber and Lyft classified drivers illegally.
""This is a resounding victory for thousands of Uber and Lyft drivers who are working hard - and, in this pandemic, incurring risk every day - to provide for their families,"" Los Angeles City Attorney Mike Feuer said in a statement.
Schulman delayed enforcing his order by 10 days to allow appeals, which Lyft said it will pursue.
California voters are expected in November to consider a ballot measure, Proposition 22, to classify app-based drivers as contractors. The state is Uber's and Lyft's largest U.S. market. 
""Drivers do not want to be employees,"" Lyft said in a statement. ""Ultimately, we believe this issue will be decided by California voters and that they will side with drivers.""
Uber did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Several hundred thousand ""gig"" workers, including many at ride-hailing companies and app-based food delivery services, are affected by AB5, which took effect on Jan. 1 and had broad support from organized labor.
Schulman said the defendants' argument they were not ""hiring entities"" covered by AB5 ""flies in the face"" of Uber's claims in other litigation, and their ""concerted effort"" to overturn the law in November.
He also said the public could face substantial harm if drivers were denied employee benefits such as minimum wage, paid sick and family leave, unemployment insurance and workers' compensation insurance.
""These harms are not mere abstractions; they represent real harms to real working people,"" Schulman wrote.
The judge said Uber and Lyft had themselves to blame if their resisting state laws contributed to any ""far-reaching"" effects an injunction might have.

""Defendants may not evade legislative mandates merely because their businesses are so large that they affect the lives of many thousands of people,"" he wrote.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Halkbank on Monday urged the dismissal of a U.S. indictment accusing the state-owned Turkish lender of helping Iran evade American sanctions, saying it was immune from prosecution and that U.S. laws did not cover its alleged misconduct.
U.S. prosecutors have accused Halkbank of using money servicers and front companies in Iran, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates to evade sanctions, enable revenue from oil and gas sales to be spent on gold, and facilitate sham food and medicine purchases.
Halkbank pleaded not guilty on March 31 to bank fraud, money laundering and conspiracy charges.
A spokesman for Acting U.S. Attorney Audrey Strauss in Manhattan declined to comment. Halkbank's trial is scheduled for March 1, 2021.
In a Manhattan court filing, Halkbank said its status as an ""instrumentality"" of Turkey shielded it from prosecution under principles of sovereign immunity.
Halkbank also said there is a ""strong presumption"" against applying U.S. criminal laws, such as the International Emergency Economic Powers Act it was accused of violating, to conduct outside the United States.
The bank said its only domestic connection was its alleged processing of transactions through domestic banks, but these were ""peripheral"" to the broader criminal case.
U.S. District Judge Richard Berman, who oversees the case, also presided over the January 2018 conviction of former Halkbank executive Mehmet Hakan Atilla and a related guilty plea by Reza Zarrab, a wealthy Turkish-Iranian gold trader.
Last month, Halkbank asked Berman to recuse himself because of possible bias. The judge has yet to rule.
Halkbank's case gained renewed attention in a recent memoir by John Bolton, a former U.S. national security advisor.
Bolton said Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan gave U.S. President Donald Trump a memo saying Halkbank was innocent, and Trump told Erdogan he would ""take care of things.""

Turkey later said Bolton's book contained misleading presentations of Erdogan's conversations with Trump.

Rohan Ramchandani, the former European head of  Citigroup 's forex spot market trading desk, in October alleged in a lawsuit that the bank unfairly dismissed him from his role without due process or warning.
He had sued the bank for more than $112 million, alleging that it made materially false and malicious statements to U.S. prosecutors that led to his trial in New York on foreign exchange-rigging charges. 
The FT report said Ramchandani's tribunal compensation would be automatically capped at around 74,000 pounds ($96,732.80) - a fraction of the 1 million pounds he earned each year - but the exact amount was yet to be determined.
He was seeking reinstatement, which would have made him eligible to receive back pay and any other awards since the dismissal. 
However, employment judge Alison Russell said giving him his job back was not practicable as Citibank had proved in the tribunal that he was dismissed due to his conduct, the report said.
""Citi had already acknowledged that Mr. Ramchandani's dismissal did not follow our usual procedures, so this aspect of the judgment is not a surprise,"" the bank said in an emailed statement. 

Ramchandani did not immediately reply to a request for comment.

Investing.com -- Blue chip stocks overcame weakness in the technology sector on Monday as the Dow surged despite lack of clarity on the timing of new economic stimulus from Washington.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose more than 360 points, or 1.3%, while the NASDAQ Compositedropped 0.39%. The S&P 500 which closed up 0.29%, is drawing nearer to its mid-February peak, regaining nearly all of the steep drop during the spring as businesses and people hunkered down amid a growing pandemic.
Second quarter earnings season is largely over, leaving investors to ride out the rest of the typically quiet late summer. School children prepare to return to the classroom in most of the country after evidence that early-to-open districts are seeing pockets of Covid outbreaks. Big 10 football might be canceled for the fall, which could be a hit to local economies that depend on revenue from college ball.
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:
1. Energy sector comes back to life
Energy stocks, which have been the worst performing S&P sector this year, showed signs of life on Monday after positive economic data out of China as well as comments about demand by  Saudi Aramco  (SE:2222).
Crude Oil WTI Futures, the U.S. benchmark, rose 2% on Monday, topping $42, while Brent Oil Futures crude, the international standard, rose 1.4%, to over $45.
The mini-rally could extend into Tuesday as traders anticipate the release of weekly data on oil inventories. Industry and government data showed last week that inventories have been dropping. 
2. Travel and delivery stocks also in spotlight
Transportation continued its rally on Monday, with the Dow Jones Transportation rising 2.7% after notching a 5.8% gain last week. FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX) helped drive the gain after Bernstein upgraded the stock to outperform from market perform and set a price target of $255. Shares of FedEx jumped 8.9% to $199.84.
Rival delivery company  United Parcel  Service Inc (NYSE:UPS) jumped 3% and set a record high after reports on Friday it would hike fees on retailers during the upcoming holiday season. It closed up 1.7%.
Meanwhile, airlines also got a boost, with United Airlines Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:UAL) is up 9%, and  American Airlines Group  (NASDAQ:AAL), JetBlue Airways Corp (NASDAQ:JBLU) and Delta Air Lines Inc (NYSE:DAL) are up more than 7%. Data from the Transportation Security Administration indicated that travelers going through TSA checkpoints rose to 831,789, up from 799,861 the week before and the most since March 17, when much of the U.S. shut down over Covid fears. The number is still down nearly 70% from a year ago.
3. Dining in is the new eating out
Meal kits and meal delivery services benefited when Americans were forced to stay at home and away from restaurant dining rooms to prevent the spread of Covid-19.
On Monday,  HelloFresh SE  (DE:HFGG) said it had witnessed ""more favorable than expected summer seasonality"" and additional demand with the return of Covid outbreaks in certain markets. The company raised its outlook for the year, saying revenue growth would likely be 75% to 95% from a previous range of 55% to 70%. It is scheduled to post earnings for the first six months of 2020 on Tuesday.
Shares of HelloFresh rose 1%.
Rival  Blue Apron Holdings Inc  (NYSE:APRN) fell 1.6%, and delivery service  Grubhub Inc  (NYSE:GRUB) fell 0.2%. Last week,  Uber Technologies Inc  (NYSE:UBER)announced that while its ride-hailing service slumped, revenue from Uber Eats delivery service surged in the quarter, with revenue rising 113% to $1.2 billion.

Investing.com - Tilray plunged in after-hours trading on Monday after reporting a wider-than-expected loss as a glut of inventory triggered an $18.6 million writedown in the second quarter of the year.
Tilray (NASDAQ:TLRY) fell more than 8% in after-hours trade.
The company reported a  net loss of $81.7 million, or a loss of 66 cents per share, compared with a net loss of $36.3 million, or 37 cents per share, in the second quarter of 2019. Revenue rose 10%, to $50.4 million. That compared with consensus estimates from Investing.com for a loss of 33 cents on revenue of $54.77 million  
""The increased net loss was primarily due to a $18.6 million inventory valuation adjustment, a charge of $28.4 million for impairment of assets, $11.2 million impact of the change in fair value of warrant liability, offset by $13.3 million of foreign exchange gains due to the strengthening of the Canadian dollar,"" the company said.
Gross margin decreased to -10.7% from 27% in the second quarter of 2019 and 21% in the first quarter of 2020.
""With our significant cost cutting and balance sheet actions behind us, we have positioned Tilray to enter the second half of 2020 in a stronger position so we can remain focused on achieving profitable growth in all our markets and deliver break-even or positive Adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter of 2020.” said Brendan Kennedy, Tilray’s chief executive officer."

Comparable property net operating income for the six months ended June 30, 2020 declined 9.3% and portfolio NOI declined 10.7%.
Its domestic and international operations were negatively impacted by approximately $1.13 per diluted share primarily, owing to ""reduced lease income and ancillary property revenues as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by approximately $0.36 per diluted share from cost reduction initiatives,"" the company said.
Simon Property said that 91% of the tenants across its U.S. retail properties were open and operating, while more than half of the remaining unopened tenants were closed because of ""restrictive governmental orders limiting or prohibiting their operations.""

Investing.com – The Dow rallied on Monday as signs that the spread of the Covid-19 is nearing a peak and a jump in energy offset rising U.S.-China tensions and worries over a lack of progress on the next fiscal stimulus package.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.3%, or 259 points. The S&P 500 gained 0.29%, and is just 1% below all time highs, while the Nasdaq Composite jumped fell 0.39%.
Energy led the broader market higher on rising oil prices following better-than-expected Chinese economic data and positive comments on the outlook for energy demand from  Saudi Aramco  (SE:2222).
Aramco chief executive Amin Nasser said on Sunday that global oil demand would continue its recovery as lockdown measures ease. China's gasoline and diesel demand are ""almost at pre-COVID 19 levels,"" Nasser added. ""As countries ease the lockdown, we expect the demand to increase.""
Industrials were also in favor, led by airlines as data showing air travel over the weekend rose to the highest volume in nearly five months.
American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL), United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) and Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) rose more than 7%.
On the stimulus front, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin attempted to ease worries, insisting that he expects lawmakers to agree on a deal by the end of the week despite reports that talks have reached an impasse.
President Donald Trump's efforts to plug the financial stimulus gap by issuing executive orders to extend unemployment benefits - at a reduced amount of $400, down from $600 a week - did little to ease worries. Economists have warned that the U.S. economy could face darker days ahead without the much-needed stimulus.  
""The U.S. economy is on a path that is about to fork. One way sees a faster recovery with new federal support. The other leads to a double-dip recession and a lagged recovery as households struggle, "" Grant Thornton Chief Economist Diane Swonk said.
But signs that the spread of the coronavirus appears to be abating helped to lift investor sentiment on risk.
There were fewer than 47,000 new infections reported Sunday in the U.S., the lowest in about a week, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University.
Tech, meanwhile, pared most of its losses, though remained pressured as rising U.S-China tensions have sparked uncertainty in the sector.
Beijing said it would sanction 11 U.S. senators in retaliation for similar measures carried out by the Trump administration against Chinese and Hong Kong officials last week.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), however, helped cushion the downside in tech, rising more than 1.6% after Wedbush lifted its price target on the stock to $515 from $475, citing expectations that the upcoming launch of the iPhone 12 will spark a jump in upgrades.
Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), down nearly 0.6%, was also in the spotlight on reports that the e-commerce giant was in talks with U.S. shopping mall owner Simon Property (NYSE:SPG) to covert JCPenney and Sears department stores into fulfillment centers.
Among consumer discretionary companies,  Foot Locker  (NYSE:FL) reported an 18% rise in same-store sales and earnings in the fiscal second quarter that beat Wall Street estimate, sending its shares more 8% higher. Foot Locker is slated to report full-quarterly earnings on Aug. 21.

As the Nasdaq 100 slumped almost 0.5% to start the week amid losses for  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT). and  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB)., the Dow Jones Industrial Average added almost 1% on the heels of Friday’s better-than-expected jobs report and ebbing virus case counts. The sunnier economic outlook also boosted the small-cap Russell 2000 by as much as 1.6%.
Monday’s trading continues a theme scene in recent weeks, when companies that would benefit most from an end to pandemic lockdowns led gains while their work-from-home counterparts trailed behind. And while plunging inflation-adjusted yields have helped to justify bubble-era tech valuations, that trend is nearing a turning point amid the dissipating gloom.
“The strong employment data from Friday carried over to this morning, boosting the recovery trade, which has more value and cyclical exposure,” said Matt Stucky, portfolio manager at Northwestern (NYSE:NWE) Mutual Wealth Management. “This also hurts the momentum trade, which is very overweight tech.”
A pure momentum portfolio was the worst-performing Monday among 10 so-called factors tracked by Bloomberg, dropping the most in two months. Meanwhile, the Dow Average has climbed 4.8% since the end of July, beating the Nasdaq 100 by 3 percentage points. August is on track to be the best month of relative performance for the 30-member gauge since October 2018.
Bargain-hunting is also fueling the rotation, according to Tallbacken Capital Advisors. The Nasdaq 100 is trading about 18% above its 200-day moving average, versus a roughly 7% gap for the Russell 2000.
“Tech is technically stretched. Every time it gets this far ahead of working support, risk/reward deteriorates,” said Michael Purves, chief executive officer of Tallbacken. “So we have a semblance of a rotation -- sell the overstretched, buy the understretched.”

(Reuters) - Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCA) on Monday asked a U.S. federal judge to dismiss a request from General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) to reinstate a racketeering lawsuit against its smaller rival, comparing a recent GM filing to a ""third-rate spy movie, full of preposterous allegations."" 
Last week, No. 1 U.S. automaker GM asked U.S. District Judge Paul Borman to reopen the case, claiming it had new information on foreign accounts used in an alleged bribery scheme involving FCA and leaders of the United Auto Workers (UAW) union.
When it first filed its lawsuit last year, GM alleged that FCA bribed UAW officials over many years to corrupt the collective bargaining process and gain advantages, costing GM billions of dollars. GM was seeking ""substantial damages"" that one analyst said could have totaled at least $6 billion.
But last month, Borman threw out the racketeering lawsuit, saying GM's alleged injuries were not caused by FCA's alleged violations.
In its latest filing, FCA said that as it operates facilities in Italy and more than 40 other countries, the existence of foreign bank accounts is ""unremarkable, and certainly not illegal.""
After FCA's filing, GM said it intends to uncover ""the full extent of harm the FCA bribery scheme caused GM.""
""FCA's corruption of the collective bargaining process remains undeniable,"" the automaker said in a statement. 
FCA is due to merge with France's PSA by the first quarter of 2021.

""It is... clear to me that this series of attacks is directly related to our success in competing and winning where it matters, in the market,"" FCA Chief Executive Mike Manley wrote on Monday in a letter to employees seen by Reuters. ""The consistent strengths we've demonstrated over the last decade will be deployed to even greater effect as we complete our merger with Groupe PSA.""

1626,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 10, 2020 03:00PM ET</span>",U.S. loan to Kodak will not proceed unless allegations cleared: White House,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. government will not proceed with a $765 million loan to Eastman Kodak Co (N:KODK) to make drugs at its U.S. factories unless the company is cleared of alleged wrongdoing in circumstances surrounding the announcement of the loan, the White House said on Monday. 
White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany made the remarks to reporters after U.S. President Trump said last week the federal government would quickly investigate the issue.
The U.S. International Development Finance Corp on Friday said the loan, aimed at helping the photographic equipment maker shift to making ingredients for pharmaceuticals, was on hold due to ""recent allegations of wrongdoing.""
McEnany said the president took the allegations seriously but declined to say if the loan could be canceled outright.
""We will not proceed any further unless these allegations are cleared,"" she said at a regular briefing, adding that the investigation was still underway.
She said the case had not shaken the president's faith in using the Defense Production Act to increase U.S. stockpiles of ventilators and other equipment to respond to the pandemic.
News of the investigation and a halt in the loan weighed heavily on Kodak shares, which were trading down 28% at $10.70 on the New York Stock Exchange on Monday afternoon.
Initial news of the loan had driven the shares 1,000% higher, generating a windfall for executives, some of whom had received options one day earlier.
Senior Democratic lawmakers last week asked federal regulators to investigate securities transactions made by the company and its executives around the time it learned it could receive the government loan.
Lawmakers said they had ""serious concerns"" about the transactions and asked the Securities and Exchange Commission to investigate the circumstances surrounding the matter. They cited growing concerns about insider trading.

The company said it had appointed a special committee of independent directors of its board to conduct an internal review.

Investing.com – The Dow advanced Monday led by energy amid a jump in oil prices, though investor sentiment was kept in check by rising U.S.-China tensions and worries over the slow progress on the next fiscal stimulus package that is needed to keep the economic recovery on a solid footing.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.26%, or 346 points. The S&P 500 gained 0.29%, while the Nasdaq Composite jumped fell 0.34%.
Energy led the broader market higher on rising oil prices following better-than-expected Chinese economic data and positive comments on the outlook for energy demand from  Saudi Aramco  (SE:2222).
Aramco chief executive Amin Nasser said on Sunday that global oil demand would continue its recovery as lockdown measures ease. China's gasoline and diesel demand are ""almost at pre-COVID 19 levels,"" Nasser added. ""As countries ease the lockdown, we expect the demand to increase.""
Industrials are also joining in on the upside as data showing air travel over the weekend rose to the highest volume in nearly five months.
American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL), United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) and Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) rose more than 7%.
On the stimulus front, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin attempted to ease worries, insisting that he expects lawmakers to agree on a deal by the end of the week.
Failure by Congress to agree a deal on the next wave of the fiscal stimulus could hurt the economy's path to recovery.
""The U.S. economy is on a path that is about to fork. One way sees a faster recovery with new federal support. The other leads to a double-dip recession and a lagged recovery as households struggle, "" Grant Thornton Chief Economist Diane Swonk said.
President Donald Trump's efforts to plug the financial stimulus gap by issuing executive orders to extend unemployment benefits - at a reduced amount of $400, down from $600 a week - did little to ease worries.
Tech, meanwhile, pared losses, though remained pressured as rising U.S-China tensions have sparked uncertainty in the sector following Washington's threat against Chinese tech companies last week.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), however, helped cushion the downside in tech, rising more than 1% after Wedbush lifted its price target on the stock to $515 from $475, citing expectations that the upcoming launch of the iPhone 12 will spark a jump in upgrades.
Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), down nearly 1%, was also in the spotlight on reports that the e-commerce giant was in talks with U.S. shopping mall owner Simon Property (NYSE:SPG) to covert JCPenney and Sears department stores into fulfillment centers.
Among consumer discretionary companies,  Foot Locker  (NYSE:FL) reported an 18% rise in same-store sales and earnings in the fiscal second quarter that beat Wall Street estimate, sending its shares more 8% higher. Foot Locker is slated to report full-quarterly earnings on Aug. 21.
In other news, Eastman Kodak (NYSE:KODK) slumped 26% as its $765 million loan from the federal government was placed on hold amid allegations of insider trading."

The U.S. International Development Finance Corp (DFC) was slated to grant the loan to Eastman Kodak, which is looking to move deeper into the pharmaceutical arena.
But alarms were raised after senior Democratic lawmakers asked federal regulators to investigate securities transactions made by the company and its executives around the time it learned it could receive the government loan.
U.S. President Donald Trump said last week the government would investigate the circumstances surrounding the announcement of the loan.
""Recent allegations of wrongdoing raise serious concerns,"" U.S. International Development Finance Corp (DFC) said late on Friday in a tweet.
The company's shares have soared more than five-fold, with retail traders on the popular Robinhood trading app piling into the stock since DFC announced it would sign a letter of interest to provide the loan to the company.
More than 900 million shares have exchanged hands since the loan announcement, nearly 12 times the company's outstanding shares.

Shares of the company were down 39.50% at $9 in pre-market trading on Monday.

1629,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 10, 2020 02:10PM ET</span>",Explainer: Microsoft's TikTok bid spotlights Windows maker's history with China,"By Josh Horwitz
SHANGHAI (Reuters) -  Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT) has emerged as the most likely buyer of the U.S. operations of TikTok, the popular Chinese short-video app that U.S. President Donald Trump is preparing to effectively ban on national security grounds.
A deal would be in line with Microsoft's stance toward China where the firm has a sizeable presence - unlike fellow U.S. tech heavyweights such as  Facebook Inc  (O:FB) and Alphabet Inc's (O:GOOGL) Google which appear to have given up on China's consumer-facing market with its miscellany of government strictures.
The country accounts for over $2 billion in annual revenue, Microsoft President Brad Smith said earlier this year.
WHAT DOES MICROSOFT DO IN CHINA?
Microsoft employs roughly 6,000 people in the country, with offices in Shanghai, Beijing and Suzhou.
Its flagship Windows operating system is widely used, though revenue has long been crimped by piracy. In recent years the firm has pushed its Azure cloud computing product, launched in 2013 via a partnership with local data service company 21Vianet.
China's cyber-security law limits Microsoft to providing Azure's software and services while 21Vianet runs associated data centres. It is a small player in a sector dominated by local providers  Alibaba  Group Holding Ltd (N:BABA), Baidu Inc (O:BIDU), Tencent Holdings Ltd (HK:0700) and Huawei Technologies Co Ltd.
Microsoft operates both its Bing search engine and LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) social network in China, though again is a small player compared with local giants.
Its most important China operation is arguably the Microsoft Research Asia, famous as a leader in artificial intelligence (AI).
Founded in 1998 with help from renowned Taiwanese-American AI scientist Kaifu Lee - who went on to lead Google's China office - the lab has produced alumni who went on to become executives at TikTok owner ByteDance, Baidu,  Xiaomi  (OTC:XIACF) Corp (HK:1810) and Chinese facial recognition unicorns. 
DOES MICROSOFT SELF-CENSOR IN CHINA? 
Bing and LinkedIn in China appear similar to their global counterparts but Microsoft censors search results and content the Chinese government considers sensitive.
Upon LinkedIn's China launch in 2014, two years before the company was bought by Microsoft, then-Chief Executive Jeff Weiner said censoring content would be ""necessary"" for the firm to grow in the country.
In 2019, free speech advocates criticised LinkedIn's position on censorship after human rights activist Zhou Fengsuo said his profile was not viewable in China. LinkedIn blamed an ""error"" and restored its visibility.
Software development website GitHub, which Microsoft purchased in 2019, is also accessible from China. The site, a coding repository, has been used by activists in China to preserve internet content before authorities censor the source.
HAS MICROSOFT HAD SCRAPES WITH CHINA'S GOVERNMENT?
Microsoft has bemoaned rampant piracy of Windows in China for decades and has occasionally filed lawsuits and complaints even against state-backed companies to address its concerns.
Its most notable tussle with the government was in 2014 when authorities raided four Microsoft offices demanding access to contracts and other information as part of an anti-trust investigation.
The same year, the government called on all agencies to ban the purchase of Windows 8 citing security reasons.
Microsoft eventually released a ""China Government"" edition of Windows 10 following a joint venture formed in 2015 with state-owned China Electronics Technology Corp.
WHAT ABOUT BILL GATES?
Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates has spoken in mostly positive terms about China in recent years. In November, he held a public meeting with Peng Liyuan, wife of President Xi Jinping.
Also late last year, Gates criticised the U.S. government's restrictions on telecommunications equipment maker Huawei and spoke about sharing Windows source code with China's government which aided official acceptance of the software in the country.
He has praised China's response to COVID-19, which earned him public thanks from Xi, and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation has donated $5 million to China for COVID-19 relief.

The foundation is one of few overseas charities or non-governmental organisations to maintain operations in China, where it has worked with the government and academic institutions against diseases such as malaria and tuberculosis.

1630,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 10, 2020 01:45PM ET</span>","Goldman, Morgan Stanley Face Stiffest Fed Capital Standards","(Bloomberg) --  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS).,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) and several foreign lenders operating in the U.S. will face the stiffest capital demands under the Federal Reserve’s first set of big-bank requirements to incorporate the regulator’s new stress buffer.
The capital levels, determined by the Fed’s most recent stress-test process, give Goldman Sachs the highest target among domestic banks, with an overall capital minimum at 13.7% of risk-weighted assets, the agency said in a statement Monday. Morgan Stanley’s target is 13.4% and JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co., the largest U.S. bank by assets, will have to maintain 11.3% under the standards taking effect Oct. 1.
Among foreign-based lenders, Deutsche Bank AG (NYSE:DB) is highest at 12.3%, with  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Group AG at 11.4% and UBS Group AG (SIX:UBSG) at 11.2%.
The Fed in its statement also affirmed stress-test results for five banks that requested reconsideration: Goldman Sachs, BMO Financial Corp.,  Capital One  Financial Corp (NYSE:COF)., Citizens Financial (NYSE:CFG) Group Inc. and Regions Financial Corp (NYSE:RF).
The new capital buffer is applied individually at each firm to simplify the process by incorporating annual stress-test performance into the industry’s day-to-day demands.
Each overall target number -- such as  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C).’s 10% -- is made up of a base capital level that’s the same for every bank: 4.5%. The Fed then adds the stress buffer, which is based on the agency’s annual tests of banks’ ability to weather adverse economic conditions. For Citigroup, that was 2.5%. And the last number is a surcharge based on a bank’s size, complexity and interconnectedness. For Citigroup, that adds another 3%.
Other totals among the largest U.S. lenders included: Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC)., 9.5%;  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC), 9%; Bank of New York Mellon (NYSE:BK) Corp, 8.5%; and  State Street  Corp (NYSE:STT)., 8%.
Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley have particularly high stress buffers because of the nature of the Fed’s exams, which put extra pressure on banks that rely heavily on capital markets.
Pat Scanlan, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs, said the Wall Street firm publicly stated that it had questions about the Fed’s stress capital buffer determination and had engaged with the regulator on the topic.
“We look forward to further discussions with the Federal Reserve as they continue their review of their stress-testing methodology,” Scanlan said.
This was an unusual year for stress testing because the banks’ balance sheets and stress scenarios were determined before the pandemic-sparked economic meltdown, which caused more severe damage than the Fed had envisioned in its hypothetical scenarios. That prompted the Fed to curtail stock buybacks and cap dividends while adjusting its testing to informally consider how banks were weathering the ongoing crisis. Results weren’t released for specific lenders, but the overall picture showed some banks struggling to maintain capital minimums.
The Fed noted that the banks are encouraged to deploy their capital cushions -- the stress buffer and the surcharge -- during tough periods. The Fed and other bank regulators have repeatedly pushed the industry to use the capital buffers to lend during the economic turmoil driven by the Covid-19 pandemic.

1636,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 10, 2020 12:45PM ET</span>","Exclusive: Russia's Nornickel no longer needs shareholder agreement, says co-owner","By Polina Devitt and Anastasia Lyrchikova
MOSCOW (Reuters) - An eight-year-old shareholder agreement signed by Russian mining giant Norilsk Nickel's (MM:GMKN) major owners has become a relic of the past which the $44 billion miner does not need, Vladimir Potanin, its largest shareholder, told Reuters.
Potanin's Interros holding, aluminium producer Rusal (HK:0486) and some other stakeholders signed https://www.reuters.com/article/us-russia-norilsk/russian-tycoon-becomes-norilsk-ceo-in-board-peace-deal-idUSBRE8BG0O320121217 the agreement on dividend payouts to end a previous four-year conflict over the size of dividend payments, Nornickel's strategy and management.
Potanin said it had now run its course.
""Maintaining this 'superstructure' will put even more pressure on Nornickel with the aim of extracting maximum dividends from it, regardless of the economic and social situation around the company,"" Potanin said in his strongest public comment on the agreement.
The deal expires on Jan. 1, 2023, with a question over whether it will be extended or suspended.
""We believe that dividends should not be reduced, but left in Russia and should be directed towards the development of the Russian economy, as Rusal does, for example,"" Rusal said in a statement.
Rusal, which bought the stake in Nornickel for $14 billion in 2008, last paid dividends in 2017 when it distributed $300 million to shareholders.
The agreement gave Nornickel's shareholders additional tools to control the company, including a veto for major stakeholders on certain deals and financial control, as well as installing Potanin as a managing partner.
Potanin told Reuters in an emailed statement that these extra tools were not needed for Nornickel's further development and modernisation, adding that business efficiency and corporate governance had improved since 2012.
He did not say whether he was ready to step away from his role as the managing partner.
Nornickel's market value has risen by 50% since 2012. 
However, the company has been hit by lower demand for commodities this year due to COVID-19, which led some of its peers to reduce dividends, and a big fuel spill at an Arctic power plant in late May.
After the spill, Potanin, who owns a stake of 34.5%, proposed capping the company's final 2020 dividend at $1 billion, while Rusal, which relies on dividends from its 27.8% stake in Nornickel, called for a management overhaul.

""Today, the vision of Interros and Rusal regarding the principles of governance in Nornickel is fundamentally different,"" Potanin said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Top U.S. tech firms including Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) and  Facebook Inc  (O:FB) filed a legal brief on Monday backing a challenge to U.S. President Donald Trump's temporary ban on the entry of certain foreign workers to preserve jobs for Americans during the coronavirus pandemic.
In the brief, filed in a lawsuit brought in California by major U.S. business associations, the companies argued that the visa restrictions will hurt American businesses, lead employers to hire workers outside the United States, and further damage the already struggling U.S. economy.
Trump issued a presidential proclamation in June that suspended the entry of a range of foreign workers until the end of the year, a move his administration said would free up jobs for unemployed Americans amid the economic fallout of the pandemic.
Among those affected by the temporary ban are skilled foreign workers entering on H-1B visas and managers and specialized workers being transferred within a company on L visas - both visa types used by tech companies. Trump's ban also blocks seasonal workers entering on H-2B visas, with an exception for workers in food supply chain jobs.
In the brief filed on Monday, the companies argue Trump's proclamation could do irreparable damage to U.S. businesses, workers and the economy, and was based on a ""false assumption"" that it would protect U.S. workers.
""Global competitors in Canada, China, and India, among others, are pouncing at the opportunity to attract well-trained, innovative individuals,"" the brief reads. ""And American businesses are scrambling to adjust, hiring needed talent to work in locations outside our nation's borders.""

Apple (O:AAPL), Microsoft (O:MSFT), Netflix (O:NFLX) and Twitter (N:TWTR) were among 52 companies that signed the brief, which was filed in a lawsuit brought by the National Association of Manufacturers, which represents 14,000 member companies, as well as in a similar lawsuit brought in Washington, D.C.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Shares in major U.S. airlines rose on Monday after the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) said it screened more than 800,000 people at U.S. airport checkpoints on Sunday for the first time since March 17.
TSA said it had screened 831,789 people on Sunday, which was still down about 70% over the prior year when about 2.5 million people were screened.
American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) Group shares jumped 8.2% in midday trading, while United Airlines shares rose 7.2%, Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) was up 6.9% and Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) rose 4.7%.
The largest 20 U.S. airlines carried 16.3 million passengers in June -- an 80% decline over the same month last year -- but nearly twice as many as May.
The coronavirus pandemic has slashed U.S. airline passenger demand, but it has rebounded from historic lows in April, when just 3 million passengers traveled.

As the virus has accelerated over the last month, airline executives have warned that demand that had shown signs of recovering could stall again, threatening jobs. Between American Airlines and United Airlines, more than 60,000 frontline workers have received warnings that their jobs are on the line on Oct. 1.

(Reuters) - Marriott International (O:MAR) said on Monday it expects cash burn for the year to be slower than previous estimated as bookings slowly recover from the coronavirus lows that pushed the hotel chain to post its first quarterly loss in nearly nine years.
The world's largest hotel chain said it was seeing a steady recovery in occupancy rates across the world with economies reopening gradually, although it may take a few years for them to return to pre-COVID levels.
The company's stock reversed course to rise 1.6% in early trading. The shares had fallen more than 3% premarket after the owner of Ritz-Carlton and St. Regis (NYSE:RGS) luxury hotel brands reported results.
""We see folks are increasingly willing to step out and travel,"" Chief Executive Officer Arne Sorenson said.
""Leisure (demand) may continue to be a significant source of recovery past Labor Day and into the fall ... but we would expect corporate to be slower.""
The hotel and the airline industries have been among the worst affected due to the COVID-19 pandemic forcing Marriott and rival Hilton (N:HLT) to cut thousands of jobs and shut many hotels as cancellations started mounting.
Marriott said on Monday Greater China was leading the global recovery and the market could approach 2019 occupancy levels as early as next year.
Overall, the company's global occupancy rates improved to 34% in the week ended Aug. 1, from 11% in April.
Marriott now expects a cash burn of $85 million a month in 2020, down from prior expectation of $145 million.
On an adjusted basis, Marriott reported a loss of 64 cents per share in the second quarter ended June 30, bigger than analysts' expectation of a loss of 42 cents per share.

Total revenue plunged 72.4% to $1.46 billion.

The company expects to incur a net loss on both a U,S, GAAP and adjusted basis for its third quarter and the 2020 fiscal year, the extent of which will depend on the timing and extent of the return to service.

1643,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 10, 2020 11:40AM ET</span>",Coronavirus accelerates European utilities' digital drive,"By Stephen Jewkes and Christoph Steitz
MILAN/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - When COVID-19 plunged Italy into lockdown, it was decision time at the Verampio power station. The control room, which runs a fleet of hydroelectric plants across the Piedmont region, hard hit by the pandemic, had to be secured to keep the lights on.
Operator  Enel  (MI:ENEI), Europe's largest utility, moved quickly to create a parallel backup control room at a smaller site 30 kms (18.6 miles) away while also plugging some workers into the plant's data base so they could work from home.
""We'd never done this sort of thing over a long period of time but it worked instantly,"" said Giuseppe Serrecchia, Enel's head of Global Power Generation Digital Hub.
""To properly respond to the challenges of COVID, we've boosted our overall digitalization drive.""
Like companies in other sectors, European utilities are having to speed up the adoption of new technologies as the coronavirus crisis forces them to use software, not people, to steer critical infrastructure including plants and grids. 
Consultants say the move was overdue.
Spain's  Iberdrola  (MC:IBE), the world's second-largest renewables group by capacity, has set up similar processes to Enel.
The pandemic has created advantages for businesses immune to shutdowns and restrictions, allowing staff to work remotely and providing technology to keep service flowing.
""Utilities that started digital programs before the crisis have been more resilient. In the post-COVID 19 world, many will need to reconsider their technology priorities,"" consultancy McKinsey said.
""Using remote supervision could help grid operators minimize the risk for their workforces while simplifying operations,"" it said in a report.
RESILIENCE
At Germany's E.ON (DE:EONGn), Europe's largest operator of energy networks with 1.56 million kms of power and gas grids, that message has also sunk in. 
It has freed up a further 500 million euros ($591 million), on top of a total 13 billion euros it plans to invest over the next three years, mostly in upgrading its energy infrastructure.
The company has increased the use of drones by 50% and relies more on automated image recognition software for the inspection of high-voltage power lines as a direct consequence of the pandemic, officials told Reuters.
E.ON, which recently completed the takeover of Innogy's networks and retail activities, is also banking on virtual reality. At subsidiary Bayernwerk, which operates distribution grids in the German state of Bavaria, E.ON has virtually recreated substations to train staff remotely and provide remote access to partner firms.
""During the corona crisis, our employees and customers have learned to re-appreciate the advantages of digitalisation,"" E.ON CEO Johannes Teyssen said, adding the group would accelerate digitising its processes.
E.ON is also in the final stages of developing an app similar to Apple's (O:AAPL) video conferencing service FaceTime that lets technicians help customers fix their smart meters at home, unless the problem is too complex to handle from afar.
The creation and use of new technologies is a step change in running infrastructure and retail businesses more efficiently and could boost valuations, analysts and consultants say.
""It builds more resilience in your business when you can operate from multiple locations,"" said Steve Jennings, head of Energy & Utilities at PwC. ""The crisis will accelerate the digital revolution for utilities.""
DIGITAL BILLIONS
Companies are investing billions to get big data infrastructure in place that will allow them not only to manage plants and grids efficiently and fast, but also roll out new services and create new revenue streams.
They could find some help from plans the European Union has put in place to combat the COVID-19 fallout as its 7-year 1-trillion-euro budget proposal and 750 billion euro recovery plan are geared towards green and digital transitions.
Enel has already spent 4.5 billion euros on digitalization in the last three years, and plans to invest a further 2.5 billion euros in 2020-2022 on ""platformisation"" of its business. ""Platformisation"" is the setting up of systems or platforms where service providers and customers can meet to do business.
But such drives don't come without risks as the increased need to work remotely also raises the chance of cyberattacks, Leo Simonovich, global head, industrial cyber and digital security at Germany's  Siemens  (DE:SIEGn), said.
""Less-reliable internet connections, social engineering attacks against employees and their families, and honest mistakes made in unfamiliar workflows are all new potential risks.""
Utilities have little choice but to plough on, concerned that they could be challenged by tech giants such as Alphabet's (O:GOOGL) Google or oil majors including  BP  (L:BP), which last week unveiled plans to enter renewables.
""If they don't do it then big data giants like Apple and Google will come in with their apps and redefine the client relationship,"" said Ingmar Wilhelm, chairman of energy big-data startup  Energisme  (PA:ALNRG).
""And COVID is hammering the message home.""

COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Denmark, angry at Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s censorship of some Danish content over an argument over copyright, said on Monday it was seeking talks with the Alphabet-owned tech giant.
Google removed all music by Danish artists on the Danish site of video streaming platform YouTube in early August, following failed negotiations on copyright with music licensing organisation Koda.
""It is a huge challenge for the distribution of Danish music that a dominant platform such as YouTube (Google) removes Danish titles from the platform due to a conflict of rights,"" culture minister Joy Mogensen said in a statement. 
""Google also owes it to clarify on how and how much artists are paid and what they will do to ensure rights and a fair settlement."" 
Mogensen said she would invite Google to a meeting with representatives of all political parties to discuss its ""role in the Danish market"".

Google was not immediately available for comment. 
Last week, Google also temporarily blocked an app on its digital store because it ""contained depictions of tobacco, pipes and dangerous activities not suitable for children under 13"", according to Danish daily Politiken. Google lifted the ban a few days later. 
Mogensen said on Monday Google's ban of the app, which streams content for children made by public broadcaster DR, was ""transgressive"".

(Reuters) - U.S. energy company  Duke Energy  Corp (NYSE:DUK) said Monday it took a $1.6-billion after-tax charge in the second quarter for the cancellation of the Atlantic Coast natural gas pipeline from West Virginia to North Carolina.
Atlantic Coast was the most expensive U.S. gas pipeline under construction when Duke and partner Dominion Energy Inc exited the $8-billion project in July due to regulatory uncertainty following years of delays and billions of dollars of cost overruns.
Dominion already took a $2.8 billion charge related to the cancellation.
Atlantic Coast is just one of several U.S. oil and gas pipelines mired in legal and regulatory battles with local and environmental groups that have found problems with U.S. permits issued by Trump administration agencies.
When Dominion, which led the Atlantic Coast project, started work on the 600-mile (966-km) pipe in the spring of 2018, the company estimated it would cost $6.0-$6.5 billion and be completed in late 2019.
Weeks before canceling the project, however, Dominion said it could finish the project in early 2022 only if it received new federal permits soon that would survive court challenges.
In addition to regulatory delays, Atlantic Coast was also hurt by a short-term hit to gas demand from coronavirus and a longer-term hit from growing consumer interest in cleaner energy.

Even though gas is the cleanest fossil fuel and is considered to be the perfect bridge from dirty coal to clean renewables, it still produces carbon.
Duke said its five-year, $56-billion capital plan remains intact despite a reduction in sales and an increase in costs to keep employees safe from the virus.
""We have clear line of sight to critical infrastructure investments to improve the energy grid and generate cleaner energy – which support our 2050 net-zero carbon emissions target,"" said Duke Chief Executive Lynn Good.

The burger company is suing former Chief Executive Officer Stephen Easterbrook for all compensation and severance benefits awarded upon his termination in November regarding ""poor judgement involving a consensual relationship with an employee.""

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets started the week in positive mood, on revived hopes for some kind of compromise over a fresh package of economic relief measures from Washington. 
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told CNBC that a deal with House Democrats is still possible this week, despite the collapse of talks last week with the two sides still over $2 trillion apart as regards the size of the measures needed.  However, Mnuchin reiterated the administration's refusal to allocate $1 trillion to state and local governments to help deal with the costs of the crisis, a core demand of Speaker Nancy Pelosi's negotiating team. 
By 10:20 AM ET (1420 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 266 points, or 1.0%, at 27,624 points. The S&P 500 was up 0.2% and the Nasdaq Composite was down 0.4%.
The Nasdaq's underperformance is likely to be brief, on recent experience. According to FactSet data, stocks that can be thought of as ""Internet stocks"" have outperformed the broader market by some 43 percentage points over the last 12 months, with almost all of the outperformance coming since March, as investors lurched to putting ever-higher premiums on growth and technology. Stocks without 'tech' appeal continue to struggle, although Marriott Hotels shrugged off a 3% drop in premarket to trade up fractionally after reporting a loss in the second quarter. Revenue per available room, a key metric for the group, fell 84% from a year earlier.
There was little support to the market directly from President Donald Trump's attempt to get around Congress by issuing executive orders extending unemployment benefits at a somewhat reduced level and suspending the payroll tax, measures that lawmakers on both sides of the aisle criticized as unconstitutional. Mnuchin acknowledged that there was no way around legislation as a long-term solution.
Among individual stocks, McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) stock fell 0.8% after it announced it's suing former CEO Steve Easterbrook to claw back millions in severance pay after fresh whistle-blower allegations of sexual impropriety while at the company.  Berkshire Hathaway Inc  (NYSE:BRKa) stock rose 1.1% after the company provided details of its biggest-ever quarterly share buyback in the second quarter.
Eastman Kodak (NYSE:KODK) stock, which had soared after the federal government announced a $765 million loan to the company for the manufacture of drug ingredients, fell 31% after the loan was frozen pending an SEC investigation into suspected insider trading ahead of the announcement.
And the country's largest mall operator, Simon Property (NYSE:SPG), saw its stock rise 4.2% after a Wall Street Journal report at the weekend that said it's looking at converting into Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) fulfillment centers unused floor space formerly rented by department stores such as JC Penney  (OTC:JCPNQ) and Sears.
In other markets, the dollar rebounded from a series of two-year lows, as Friday's jobs report prompted some short-covering. U.S. Crude Oil futures rose 2.2% to $42.13 a barrel, while Gold Futures regained momentum, rising 1.5% to $2,047.40 a troy ounce.

Unilever said the law, if passed, would mean it needs to pay 11 billion euros ($12.94 billion) to the Dutch government.
It is not clear whether the law, proposed by the opposition Green Left political party, is in accordance with Dutch and European law, or whether it would win majority support in the Dutch parliament.
The Netherlands' Council of State is considering the proposed law and will give an advisory opinion as to whether it is legal. It has not set a date for its decision.
Unilever said it did not think the Green Left plan was legal.
""Nevertheless, if the bill were enacted in its present form, the boards believe that proceeding with unification, if it resulted in an exit tax charge of some 11 billion euros, would not be in the best interests of Unilever,"" it said.
The remarks were published on Monday as part of a shareholders' circular ahead of a Sept. 21 extraordinary meeting in Rotterdam to approve the unification.
Taxes have played a pivotal role in Unilever's decision-making as it tries to simpify its dual structure: it had initially decided to unify headquarters in Rotterdam, in 2018.
But it cancelled those plans after the Dutch government decided to retain a 15% withholding tax on dividends.
Britain does not impose a withholding tax on dividends.

The company's shares, which have lost over 60% of their value this year, fell nearly 2% in premarket trading.
Royal Caribbean, which dropped ""Cruises"" from its corporate name last month, expects to burn $250 million to $290 million of cash on average per month, while its operations are suspended during one of the industry's worst periods in history.
Royal Caribbean, which has pledged dozens of ships to raise billions of dollars of new debt, said it had about $4.1 billion in cash and cash equivalents at the end of June.
Net loss attributable to the company was $1.64 billion, or $7.83 per share, in the second quarter ended June 30, after also writing down the value of certain assets by $156.5 million.

On an adjusted basis, Royal Caribbean lost $6.13 per share, while analysts had expected a loss of $4.82 per share, according to Refinitiv IBES data.

1658,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 10, 2020 08:35AM ET</span>",UK shopper numbers rise after launch of state-funded dining scheme,"LONDON (Reuters) - Shopper numbers, or footfall, across all British retail destinations rose 3.8% last week from the previous week, with the start of a state-funded eating out scheme helping evening traffic more than lunchtimes, industry data showed on Monday.
Britain's retail and hospitality sectors, already struggling with high rents and business taxes, were hit particularly hard by the coronavirus lockdown and thousands of job losses have been announced.
To get the country spending again the 500 million pound ($653 million) ""Eat Out to Help Out"" scheme offers 50% off the bill for eat-in food and drink - up to 10 pounds per person, excluding alcohol - on Mondays, Tuesdays and Wednesdays in August. 
The government hopes the unprecedented subsidy, along with cuts to value-added tax for the hospitality sector, will help to reduce job losses at restaurants, cafes, bars and pubs, which employ 1.8 million people.
Official data published last month showed that UK retail sales excluding fuel were back to year-ago levels in June, but the recovery was driven by a boom in online shopping and extra spending at supermarkets as people ate out less.
Market researcher Springboard said that footfall rose 4.5% in UK shopping streets in the week to Aug. 8 compared with the previous week. It was up 3.3% in retail parks and up 3% in shopping centres.
Between Monday and Wednesday, during the Eat Out to Help Out scheme, footfall rose in retail destinations across the United Kingdom by 18.9% after 6pm, versus a rise of 9.6% at lunchtime (12pm to 2pm).
“The jury is still out regarding the benefit of the Eat Out to Help Out scheme,"" said Springboard director Diane Wehrle.
""Although there were rises in footfall on each day between Monday and Wednesday from the week before, it is clear that it was the post 6pm period that yielded the greatest rise in footfall and also that smaller towns benefited more than large city centres.""
Springboard said that footfall across all UK retail destinations remained more than a third lower than in 2019, with a year-on-year decline of 34%.

1659,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 10, 2020 08:15AM ET</span>","Wall Street bonuses likely to tumble, job cuts to start in late 2020: report","By Elizabeth Dilts Marshall
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Most Wall Street workers can expect to see their bonuses slashed this year and some jobs may be cut, according to a report published Monday by compensation consulting firm Johnson Associates Inc. 
Banks are struggling to curb rising costs as shutdowns caused by the pandemic have put millions out of work, and forced banks to add billions to reserves in case consumers or business customers default on loans. 
These costs are likely to hurt employee incentives, like bonuses, despite the recent rebound in U.S. equities markets, according to the report, which is closely watched by financial professionals. 
Only traders and investment bankers who work in underwriting are likely to receive bigger bonuses in 2020, compared with 2019, according to the report.
Underwriters have been in high demand since March as corporations rushed to raise money during the pandemic, and traders have been handling record-high volumes of transactions as investors looked for opportunities in the volatile markets. 
Conversely, workers in hedge funds, asset management, private equity and retail and commercial banking should expect incentives to shrink by as much as 30%, according to the report.
Layoffs could begin at traditional asset management firms and investment and commercial banking divisions later this year or in early 2021, as banks struggle to make a profit as the pandemic suppressed client activity and threatens to cause loan defaults.
Alan Johnson, author of the report, has said that layoffs this year could be significant. Companies were forced to make quick decisions and cut red tape during the pandemic, and they have recognized fewer employees are needed to do certain jobs, Johnson said.

1660,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 10, 2020 08:11AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Microsoft faces complex technical challenges in TikTok carveout,"By Echo Wang and Paresh Dave
(Reuters) -  Microsoft Corp 's (O:MSFT) bid to carve out parts of TikTok from its Chinese owner ByteDance will be a technically complex endeavor that could test the patience of President Donald Trump's administration, according to sources familiar with the setup.
Trump has given Microsoft until Sept. 15 to put together a blueprint for an acquisition that safeguards the personal data of Americans stored on the short-video app, and he has issued an order to ban it if there is no deal by then. 
Microsoft is negotiating a transition period that will give it time to ringfence TikTok technologically from ByteDance after they agree to a deal, Reuters reported on Aug. 2.
The clean break that Trump and lawmakers envision could take a year or more, some of the sources said.
TikTok is functionally and technically similar to ByteDance-owned Douyin, which is available only in China, and shares technical resources with it and other ByteDance-owned properties, people familiar with the matter said. 
ByteDance started working on their technological separation several months ago amid scrutiny from the U.S. government, a source familiar with the process told Reuters. It began planning for a split as part of a strategy to shift its power from China, Reuters has reported. 
While the code for the app, which determines the look and feel of TikTok, has been separated from Douyin, the server code is still partially shared across other ByteDance products, the source said. The server code provides basic functionality of the apps such as data storage, algorithms for moderating and recommending content and the management of user profiles.
To ensure uninterrupted TikTok service, Microsoft would likely need to rely on ByteDance’s code while it reviews and revises the code, and moves to a new back-end infrastructure to serve users, according to cyber security expert Ryan Speers at River Loop Security, which provides services including cybersecurity due diligence for deals.
Any continuing technical or operational reliance of the U.S. business on the Chinese company after the sale generally would have been unacceptable to the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), said Aimen Mir, former Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Treasury responsible for CFIUS, now a partner at the law firm Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer.
In the past, CFIUS has required adoption of increased protections pending a sale, including separation of the U.S. business from foreign sellers to the furthest extent possible, he said.
Another challenge Microsoft faces is how it will transfer what is viewed as TikTok's secret sauce, the recommendation engine that keeps users glued to their screens. This engine, or algorithm, powers TikTok's ""For You"" page, which recommends the next video to watch based on an analysis of user behavior.
TikTok uses recommendation algorithms that are independent from Douyin, according to two sources familiar with the matter. But what makes it tick is the content and user information that is fed into the algorithm.
""Algorithms are not worth anything without the data,"" said Jim DuBois, a former Chief Information Officer at Microsoft. DuBois is a venture adviser at Ignition Partners. ""Segmenting the data for those countries is a significant task."" 
Microsoft's negotiations for the acquisition of the U.S., Canada, New Zealand and Australia operations of TikTok complicates a separation. Not only would TikTok have to be separated from ByteDance, it would have to be broken up from TikTok's other regions. This adds to the technical challenges because of the amount of data involved.
""The biggest part is separating the user data - both content and data about users,"" DuBois said, noting hard disks of data would likely need to be transferred between ByteDance and Microsoft.
TikTok had said its user data was stored in the U.S., with a backup in Singapore, separate from the rest of the company. 

The proposed timeline makes consummating a deal very challenging, said Karen C. Hermann, a deal lawyer at Venable LLP: ""It can sometimes take months and months just to identify the business needs of the divested business, what IP and other assets it uses exclusively, and what assets and IP it shares with other businesses in the company group.""

The biotech firm said on Monday it plans to offer a total of up to 15.33 million new shares, adding the shares will likely be priced at between $14.00 and $16.00 apiece.
Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) and  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) are acting as joint book-runners, with Berenberg and Kempen & Co acting as passive book-running managers, it added.
The proceeds will fund the development of an mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine, the ramp-up of manufacturing capabilities, its oncology drug development and the development of a rabies vaccine, among other ventures, according to the statement.
The group, which is controlled by Software firm SAP co-founder Dietmar Hopp and also backed by the foundation of Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) co-founder Bill Gates, initially flagged plans to go public on July 24.
It previously won the German state, British drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE:GSK) and the Qatar Investment Authority as investors funding its growth.
Hopp has agreed to purchase shares worth 100 million euros ($117 million) at the IPO.

1664,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 10, 2020 07:20AM ET</span>",Malaysia's Top Glove compensates migrant workers after U.S. Customs ban,"KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysia's Top Glove Corporation (KL:TPGC) said on Monday it had begun making remediation payments to migrant workers who were employed by the world's largest medical glove maker before 2019, when it put in place ethical recruitment practices.
The United States is a major market for medical gloves, which have seen huge demand as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and last month the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) placed a detention order on imports from two of Top Glove's subsidiaries.
Such action is normally taken by the CBP against companies suspected of using forced labour. Foreign workers are often charged a fee by employment agents to land jobs in Malaysia, a debt they then work to pay off.
Top Glove said in a stock exchange statement that it had made the first remediation payment of 4.4 million ringgit ($1 million).
""The total remediation fee to be paid is estimated at 53 million ringgit, subject to finalisation with the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP),"" it said, adding that it ""continues to actively engage with the U.S. CBP towards resolving the Withhold Release Order (WRO) expeditiously"".
It had earlier said it had made progress in engagement with the CBP and hoped to resolve the matter this month. 
Smaller rival  Hartalega Holdings Bhd  (KL:HTHB) earlier said that from the fourth quarter it will reimburse up to a total of 40 million ringgit in recruitment fees previously paid by migrant workers to employment agents.
Another rival  Supermax Corporation Bhd  (KL:SUPM) said its net profit for the quarter ended June 30 had risen from 15.06 million ringgit to 399.62 million ringgit.
It said this was its ""best quarterly financial performance"" and had been driven by an exponential rise in demand for gloves and an increase in production capacity, which it plans to almost double by the end of 2022.

1665,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 10, 2020 07:05AM ET</span>",Stocks - U.S. Futures Higher on Trump Moves; Dow Futures Up 80 Pts,"By Peter Nurse   
Investing.com - U.S. stocks are set to open largely higher Monday, with investors taking comfort from President Donald Trump's moves to boost the economy in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.
At 7:05 AM ET (1105 GMT), US 500 Futures traded 3 points, or 0.1%, higher, the Dow Futures contract rose 80 points, or 0.3%, while Nasdaq 100 Futures fell 7 points, or 0.1%, taking a break after a period of historic gains. 
Over the weekend, President Trump signed a series of executive orders aimed at bolstering the economy, including an extension of expanded jobless benefits at a lower rate - $400 a week, down from $600. Trump's order also envisages that states pay one fourth of that bill.
This move was immediately criticized as unconstitutional by House Democrats, while Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said they would be held responsible for any hold up in the distribution of benefits if the order is challenged legally.
“The main focus for markets is whether the U.S. can agree on the next round of fiscal stimulus,” said Benjamin Jones, a senior multi-asset strategist at  State Street  (NYSE:STT) Bank, reported by Bloomberg. “News over the weekend boosts the chances that another round is agreed relatively quickly.”
The need for more stimulus was illustrated Friday, as although the headline jobless number showed a better-than-expected gain in July, there are increasing signs of long-term damage to the workforce.
Payrolls remain 13 million below pre-pandemic levels and the number of people out of work for 15 weeks or longer more than doubled from the prior month, to 8 million. 
This comes as the number of coronavirus cases in the United States topped 5 million people over the weekend, taking just six weeks to double, with the country recording more than 160,000 deaths, nearly a quarter of the world's total. The U.S. accounts for less than 5% of global population.
Tensions between the west and China also ratcheted up a notch Monday, after China arrested Jimmy Lai, one of Hong Kong’s richest and best-known publishers and a British national, on suspicion of collusion with foreign agents. 
The economic data slate is largely empty Monday, although it does become more crowded as the week progresses, while earnings season is entering its final stretch.
There are numbers expected from the likes of Barrick Gold (NYSE:GOLD), Marriott International (NASDAQ:MAR),  Duke Energy  (NYSE:DUK), Worldpay Inc (NYSE:WP), Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) and  Royal Caribbean  (NYSE:RCL) Cruises.
Oil prices pushed higher Monday, helped by a bullish picture of demand from state-controlled  Saudi Aramco  (SE:2222), the largest oil producer in the world. 
The company’s Chief Executive Amin Nasser said on Sunday that oil consumption in Asia, Aramco’s largest regional market, has almost returned to pre-coronavirus levels, and he sees oil demand increasing as economies gradually open up after the easing of coronavirus lockdowns.
U.S. crude futures traded 1.6% higher at $41.89 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract rose 0.9% to $44.80. 
Elsewhere, gold futures rose 0.6% to $2,030.15/oz, recovering a touch after Friday’s sharp selloff on the back of the better-than-expected July jobs report. The contract hit an all-time high of $2,072.5 last week. EUR/USD traded 0.3% lower at 1.1747.

Lai, a critic of Beijing, is the highest profile person to be arrested under the legislation. He was detained on suspicion of colluding with foreign forces, a crime punishable by up to life in prison.
After initially falling by almost a fifth, shares in Next Digital, which publishes Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Daily, a pro-democracy, tabloid-style newspaper that also produces investigative work, jumped as much as 344% to their highest since June 2019 at HK$0.40, boosting its market value by HK$817 million ($105.42 million). 
Having logged record trading volume, the stock eventually closed up 183%. 
A former columnist for the media group, Stanley Wong, said he bought 1.2 million shares before noon to show support for the company and then offloaded them, making a profit of HK$75,000. Wong said he would use the proceeds to fund a scholarship at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. 
""The only way I can think of to support Next Media is to buy its stock,"" Wong said.
Netizens called the surge a ""yellow stock circle,"" referring to companies that support Hong Kong's democracy movement, and ""stock with you"". One said purchasing shares was the only way to show support and they didn't care if they lost all their money. 
Other supporters posted screenshots of their share purchases on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), although Reuters was unable to verify the authenticity of the posts.
Some brokers meanwhile speculated Lai may be forced to sell the group, while market watchers also said the prospect of new leadership at the company could be behind the surge. 
""After this event, the market is looking ahead. Maybe, if this chairman is no longer here, another person would take this company in a different direction,"" said Kenny Ng, an analyst at brokerage Everbright Sun Hung Kai in Hong Kong.
Representatives at Hong Kong markets regulator Securities and Futures Commission and Hong Kong stock exchange declined to comment on the stock's rally. 
An Apple Daily executive said the newspaper would be published as usual on Tuesday. 

""Even if Apple Daily publish a pile of blank paper tomorrow, we would go and buy a copy of it until it's sold out,"" democracy activist Joshua Wong said on Facebook, while lawmaker Ted Hui urged people to buy copies of the newspaper no matter what.

Sectors seen as sensitive to economic health such as banks (SX7P), oil and gas firms (SXEP) and miners (SXPP) rose after data showed China's factory deflation eased in July, driven by a rise in global oil prices and as industrial activity climbed back towards pre-coronavirus levels.

Heavyweight technology index (SX8P) fell 1.2%, capping gains in the broader market amid worries over the U.S-China rift ahead of a scheduled trade talks on Aug. 15 to review the agreement signed in January.
Dutch tech investor  Prosus  (AS:PRX) slid for a third day running as the U.S. prepares ban on two popular Chinese apps, WeChat and TikTok.
""President Trump's decision is yet another one that could prompt a counter response and possible escalation from Beijing, with U.S. companies operating in Hong Kong and China, particularly vulnerable,"" Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, wrote in a note.
With the bulk of earnings season over, investors were monitoring the ongoing negotiations between White House officials and Democrats over a fifth bill to address the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Saturday signed executive orders and memorandums aimed at unemployment benefits, evictions, student loans and payroll taxes.
Meanwhile, a resurgence in COVID-19 cases in Europe was also investors' radar as Britain on Sunday recorded its highest daily rise in new infections since late June.
French engineering company Spie (PA:SPIE) jumped 4.2% after a double upgrade to ""buy"" from Jefferies (NYSE:JEF), while Norwegian energy firm Equinor (OL:EQNR) rose 1% after it appointed a company executive Anders Opedal as chief executive officer.

LONDON (Reuters) - European shares rose on Monday as industrial activity in China gained strength, another sign of recovery from the coronavirus pandemic that added to hopes the global economy would also return to health.
The broader Euro STOXX 600 (STOXX) rose 0.6%, with London's FTSE (FTSE) buoyed 1% and European oil and gas shares (SXEP) climbing 2% on rising oil prices. 
Shares in  BP  (L:BP) and Royal Dutch Shell (L:RDSa) rose 3.4% and 2.7% respectively after  Saudi Aramco  (SE:2222) raised optimism about a growth in Asian demand and Iraq pledged to further cut supply. [O/R]
Deflation at China's factories eased in July, data showed, driven by a rise in global energy prices and as industrial activity climbed back towards pre-coronavirus levels.
Industrial output in the world's second-biggest economy is steadily returning to levels seen before the pandemic paralysed huge swathes of the economy, driven by pent-up demand, government stimulus and surprisingly resilient exports.
That bodes well for the global recovery from the coronavirus pandemic, market players said. 
""China is so much in advance in this process of lockdowns and exiting lockdown, that any good signs for the Chinese economy is essential (for the world economy),"" said Florian Ielpo, head of macroeconomic research at Unigestion.
The MSCI world equity index (MIWD00000PUS), which tracks shares in 49 countries, gained 0.1%. Wall Street futures gauges (ESc1) pointed to a positive start. 
But advances were checked by tension between the United States and China. Uncertainty about a deal on a U.S. stimulus package also weighed on markets
U.S. President Donald Trump signed executive orders banning Chinese social media platforms WeChat - owned by Chinese tech giant Tencent (HK:0700) - and TikTok starting next month, and imposed sanctions on 11 Hong Kong and Chinese officials. 
U.S. regulators also recommended that overseas companies listed on American exchanges be subject to U.S. public audit reviews from 2022.
The U.S.-China tensions has stoked fears about an adverse impact on trade talks. Any friction here could complicate the global recovery from the coronavirus pandemic, investors said.
Underscoring concerns, European tech shares (SX8P) lost 0.8% on the tension between Washington and Beijing, the only sector to fall in early trade.
Earlier, Asian shares outside Japan (MIAPJ0000PUS) seesawed in holiday-thinned trade, staying below a six-and-a-half-month peak touched last week. They were last up 0.1%.
WAITING FOR WASHINGTON
Causing further uncertainty for investors are ongoing talks in Washington over a U.S. fiscal stimulus package that have hobbled the U.S. dollar.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Sunday said they were open to restarting aid talks. 
Trump has sought to take matters into his own hands, signing executive orders and memorandums aimed at unemployment benefits, evictions, student loans and payroll taxes.
With investors worried that the U.S. recovery may lag behind those in other major economies, the dollar's two-year supremacy has slipped.
Against a basket of currencies, the dollar was a fraction firmer at 93.339 (=USD) and still just above a two-year trough.
""The fresh stimulus provided by President Trump through executive orders is better than none at all and provides a stop gap solution,"" wrote analysts at MUFG in London.

1672,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 10, 2020 03:58AM ET</span>","Piyasalar – Avrupa Çoğunlukla Yüksek; Capita, Sözleşmenin Uzatılması ile Yükseldi","By Peter Nurse 
Investing.com - European stock markets traded mostly higher Monday, helped by positive economic news out of both China and the U.S., as well as moves by President Donald Trump to extend U.S. jobless benefits.
At 3:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.1% lower, the CAC 40 in France rose 0.4% and the U.K.'s FTSE index was up 0.7%.
China's problem with producer price deflation eased in July, according to data released earlier Monday, boosting hopes of economic recovery in the world's second-biggest economy. 
The country reported a higher-than-expected consumer price index for July, with increases of 2.7% and 0.6% year-on-year and month-on-month respectively. July’s producer price index also beat the previous month's figure, although it fell 2.4% year-on-year. The PPI has now registered a full year of year-on-year declines.
This follows on from Friday’s U.S. jobless report coming in slightly better than analysts had forecast, and news on Saturday that U.S. President Donald Trump signed a series of executive orders, including one that extends federal unemployment benefits at a rate of $400 per week from the expired level of $600 per week, after talks with Congress broke down.
Important economic data are thin on the ground in Europe Monday, while the corporate earnings season is entering its final stretch.
Capita (LON:CPI) stock rose 3% after saying Monday that it has secured a 355 million pounds ($463.3 million) extension to its contract with Transport for London to continue to manage London's congestion charge.
 Alstom  (PA:ALSO) fell 1.4% after saying it still plans on buying Bombardier’s rail unit despite what it calls “unexpected and negative developments.” Bombardier (OTC:BDRBF) reported a loss of $319 million for the second quarter, driven in part by problems at its rail business.
Oil prices pushed higher Monday, helped by a bullish picture of demand from state-controlled  Saudi Aramco  (SE:2222), the largest oil producer in the world. 
The company’s Chief Executive Amin Nasser said on Sunday that oil consumption in Asia, Aramco’s largest regional market, has almost returned to pre-coronavirus levels, and he sees oil demand increasing as economies gradually open up after the easing of coronavirus lockdowns.
U.S. crude futures traded 1.6% higher at $41.89 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract rose 1.2% to $44.92. 
Elsewhere, gold futures rose 0.7% to $2,031.30/oz, recovering a touch after Friday’s sharp selloff on the back of the better-than-expected July jobs report. The contract hit an all-time high of $2,072.5 last week. EUR/USD traded 0.2% lower at 1.1765.

1673,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 10, 2020 03:50AM ET</span>",Top U.S. mall operator Simon faces pandemic pain,"By Uday Sampath Kumar and Lisa Baertlein
(Reuters) - Surging COVID-19 infections in big states like California, Texas and Florida are scaring shoppers away from newly reopened malls, dealing a blow to an industry that was on the ropes even before the pandemic began.
Simon Property Group (N:SPG), the No. 1 U.S. mall owner, is expected to post its smallest quarterly profit in nearly six years on Monday, as the plunge in foot traffic and early government-mandated closures resulted in tenants being unable or unwilling to pay full rent. 
""The upcoming earnings for mall owners could be one of the worst quarters ever,"" said Compass Point Research & Trading analyst Floris van Dijkum.
The pain from a slew of major retail bankruptcies, including Neiman Marcus and Brooks Brothers, and hundreds of store closures from department stores Macy's (N:M) and Nordstrom (N:JWN) and others is far from over for shopping malls, as the coronavirus pandemic takes a toll on brick-and-mortar retailers that were already losing sales to online competitors.
Simon has full or partial ownership in seven of the nation's top 10 malls, as measured by sales of mall tenants. Its indoor malls in pandemic-ravaged states have been hit particularly hard. Foot traffic was down more than 50% at Houston's upscale Galleria and at Miami's Aventura Mall in mid-July, according to cellphone tracking data provided by Unacast.
Even Simon's outdoor Sawgrass Mills outlet center in Florida, the No. 1 U.S. mall, was not immune, with traffic in mid-July off 37% as COVID-19 infections spiked. But at Woodbury Common Premium Outlets, an outdoor mall in New York, where infections are in check, the decline was only 8%.

Simon's strong liquidity position, helped by its June decision to abandon a $3.6 billion deal to buy Taubman Centers (N:TCO), is expected to help it weather the worst of the pandemic. It had nearly $4 billion of cash or cash equivalents at the end of March.
But analysts say it has a mighty battle ahead as its retail tenants fight for their lives.
Simon did not respond to a request for comment. 
Reuters reported in June that Indianapolis-based Simon and peer Brookfield Property Partners (O:BPY) were in joint talks to bid on J.C. Penney, a major department store anchor for malls that filed for bankruptcy in May and whose survival hinges on urgent sale negotiations.
""When you have to start buying your tenants, you're in a big problem,"" said Scott Crowe, chief investment strategist at CenterSquare Investment Management. 
""It's the complete antithesis of being a landlord. The only reason one would buy a retailer is because it's the least worst option and they know they won't be able to lease that space to anyone else,"" he said.
It is not, however, Simon's first stab at buying a retailer. Simon and Brookfield, along with a third company, acquired teen apparel chain Forever 21 last February, and Simon in 2016 was part of a consortium that bought another teen apparel retailer, Aeropostale https://www.reuters.com/article/us-aeropostale-m-a-authenticbrands-idUSKCN1180AC. 
On Sunday, The Wall Street Journal, citing sources, reported that Simon and Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) are exploring converting mall space formerly occupied by J.C. Penney and Sears Holding Corp into Amazon distribution centers. Simon did not respond to a Reuters request for comment. An Amazon spokeswoman said the company has a policy of not commenting on rumors or speculation. Sears and J.C. Penney both declined to comment.
The challenges now are intense. Companies like  Coach  handbag maker Tapestry Inc (N:TPR) smarting from falling store traffic say mall retailers need rent reductions to survive. 
Mall rents, which grew 2.5% annually over the past four years, could fall as much as 4.3% in 2020, according to real estate analytics company  CoStar Group  (O:CSGP). 
Still, experts are betting that malls will have a place, albeit much smaller, in the post-pandemic world as many shoppers still prefer to see, touch and try before they buy. 

""At some point when enough malls flush out, those who survive - the Simons and Maceriches of the world - will come out stronger,"" said Michael Jerbich, president of B. Riley Real Estate.

1676,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 10, 2020 02:15AM ET</span>",Pay out or stay out? Dividends in doubt as Australian profits catch virus,"By Byron Kaye and Paulina Duran
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian companies are likely to deliver smaller dividends in what is forecast to be the country's worst earnings season in a decade because of the coronavirus pandemic, with even firms that benefited from the upheaval expected to show caution.
Fund managers and analysts expect the corporate results season that begins this week to reveal an overall decline in profits of around one-fifth due to the abrupt shutdowns that followed the virus outbreak. 
That's bad news for dividend payouts, which are closely watched in Australia, where around two million people, or 8% of the population, manage their own retirement income. Investing in stocks is popular, particularly given record low interest rates have made bonds and cash savings an unattractive alternative.
Even companies that are expected to have fared well during the pandemic, like supermarket duopoloy  Coles Group Ltd  (AX:COL) and Woolworths Group Ltd (AX:WOW), are expected to tread carefully given ongoing uncertainty.
""I still wouldn't expect a recovery in dividends at all this half,"" said Sean Sequeira, chief investment officer at Australian Eagle Asset Management. The majority of companies are reporting full year 2019/20 earnings, while others post quarterly earnings.
""Most companies will tend to conserve their cash, and I think that that will be readily accepted by the market.""
Regulators earlier this year asked banks, which account for about a third of the market's total dividends, to consider freezing payments due to the economic uncertainty. 
They have since relaxed their guidance to say banks may now distribute up to 50% of their profit, and on Wednesday No. 1 lender Commonwealth Bank of Australia (AX:CBA) will set the pace when it reports earnings expected to be about 10% lower. 
 Westpac Banking  (NYSE:WBK) Corporation (AX:WBC) and Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (AX:ANZ) are expected to announce the resumption of dividends after deferring payments in the first half - but at a lower rate.
""Banks are going to be dealing with bad and doubtful debts and defaulting mortgages for a sustained period,"" said Perpetual Ltd chief strategist Matt Sherwood, adding that banks likely did not have enough free capital to cover future losses. 
Still, investors dependent on dividend income are pushing companies to pay out as much as they can, particularly retailers like Harvey Norman Holdings Ltd (AX:HVN) and JB Hi-Fi Ltd (AX:JBH), data operator Appen Limited (AX:APX), and telecoms and internet giant Telstra (AX:TSL), all of which have reported higher revenues since the pandemic broke.
Telstra is one of the country's most widely held companies, with more than 1 million shareholders.

""Some sectors of the economy have done very well during COVID ... and have reasonable cash flow positions and we would like to see some form of dividend being paid,"" said Will Baylis, a portfolio manager at Martin Currie.

Investing.com - European stock markets are seen edging higher at the open Monday, helped by positive economic news out of both China and the U.S.. However, trading ranges are likely to be tight as the earnings season winds down and focus remains on U.S. lawmakers over additional stimulus.
At 2:15 AM ET (0615 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.5% higher, the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. rose 0.4%, while CAC 40 futures in France climbed 0.6%.
China saw its factory deflation ease in July, according to data released earlier Monday, boosting hopes of economic recovery in the world's second biggest economy.

July’s producer price index also beat the previous month's figure, although it  fell 2.4% year-on-year. The PPI has now registered a full year of year-on-year declines.
This follows on from Friday’s U.S. jobless report coming in slightly better than analysts had forecast, and news on Saturday that U.S. President Donald Trump signed a series of executive orders to extend unemployment benefits, to a certain extent, after talks with Congress broke down.
“I view this as another step in negotiations rather than a cessation of negotiations, with a still unknown timeline,” JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) analyst Andrew Tyler said in a note, reported by Reuters.
“If we see the White House take the view that they no longer want to negotiate until after the election, then think we’ll see a wave of GDP downgrades followed by lower realized spending and spikes to unemployment in September through year-end.”

1678,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 09, 2020 11:45PM ET</span>","Saudi Aramco's profit plunges, sees signs of oil market recovery","By Saeed Azhar and Rania El Gamal
DUBAI (Reuters) - State oil giant  Saudi Aramco  (SE:2222)'s profit plunged 73% in the second quarter of the year, as a slump in energy demand and prices due to the coronavirus crisis hit sales at the world's biggest oil exporter.
But the company stuck with plans to pay $75 billion in dividends this year and CEO Amin Nasser said global oil demand was recovering. 
All major oil companies have taken a hit in the second quarter as lockdowns to contain the coronavirus limited travel, which reduced oil consumption and sent prices tumbling to levels not seen in nearly two decades.
Aramco, which listed in Riyadh last year in a record $29.4 billion flotation, said the rapid spread of COVID-19 globally had significantly reduced demand for crude oil, natural gas and petroleum products.
Nasser told reporters he had seen a partial recovery in the energy market and a pick up in demand as economies gradually open after the easing of coronavirus lockdowns.
""Look at China, their gasoline and diesel demand is almost at pre-COVID 19 levels. We are seeing that Asia is picking up and other markets (too),"" he told reporters after announcing the company's quarterly results. 
""As countries ease the lockdown, we expect the demand to increase.""
Nasser said Aramco was committed to its 2020 dividend.
""We intend to pay the $75 billion, subject to board approval and market conditions,"" he said.
The group's dividends play a critical role in helping the Saudi government to manage its fiscal deficit. 
Aramco reported a 73.4% fall in second-quarter net profit, a steeper drop than analysts had forecast, and said it expected capital expenditure for 2020 to be at the lower end of a $25 billion to $30 billion range.
Net profit fell to 24.6 billion riyals ($6.57 billion) for the quarter to June 30 from 92.6 billion riyals a year earlier.
Analysts had expected net profit of 31.3 billion riyals, according to the mean estimate from three analysts, provided by Refinitiv.
""Aramco figures are healthy compared to other global peers,"" Mazen al-Sudairi, head of research at Al Rajhi Capital, said. ""This was the worst quarter in the modern history of oil industry, and surviving it with healthy figures points to a very positive outlook.""
Aramco shares were up about 0.4% in early trade. The group is currently the world's second most valuable publicly traded company after Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).
Aramco said it will pay a dividend of $18.75 billion for the second quarter of this year, in line with plans for a $75 billion dividend for 2020.
BP (NYSE:BP) earlier this month cut its dividend for the first time in a decade after a record second-quarter loss, while Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) in April cut its dividend for the first time since World War Two.
Aramco's free cash flow stood at $6.1 billion in the second quarter and $21.1 billion for the first half of 2020, respectively, compared with $20.6 billion and $38.0 billion for the same periods in 2019. 

Aramco's gearing ratio was 20.1% at the end of June, mainly reflecting the deferred consideration for the acquisition of Saudi Basic Industries Corp and the consolidation of SABIC’s net debt on to Aramco’s balance sheet.($1 = 3.7501 riyals)

Investing.com – Asian stocks were mostly up on Monday, with China reporting an easing in July’s factory deflation earlier in the day.
The country reported a better-than-expected consumer price index for July, with increases of 2.7% and 0.6% year-on-year and month-on-month respectively. July’s producer price index also beat the previous month's figure, although it reported a 2.4% decrease year-on-year.
China’s Shanghai Composite was up 0.29%, reversing some earlier losses, by 11:22 PM ET (4:22 AM GMT). The Shenzhen Component was down 0.93%.
But gains were capped by mounting U.S.-China tensions. The U.S. triggered the latest round of tensions after it slapped sanctions on senior Hong Kong and Chinese officials, including Hong Kong’s Chief Executive Carrie Lam, on Friday for their role in the enactment of the city’s national security laws.
The move follows U.S. President Donald Trump’s executive orders banning the WeChat and TikTok apps by September, as well as a recommendation from U.S. regulators that overseas firms listed on U.S. stock exchanges undergo U.S. public audit reviews from 2022, both announced during the previous week.
Investors will be looking at the impact of the rising tensions on the virtual meeting between officials from both countries to discuss trade, scheduled for August 15.
“The bigger question for markets is whether these actions jeopardize the U.S.-China trade talks on August 15 and markets will be looking closely for any Chinese retaliation,” Tapas Strickland, director of markets & economics at National Australia Bank (OTC:NABZY), told Reuters.
“The running assumption in markets has been President Trump needed the phase one deal to succeed, as much as China, this side of the November elections... At the same time President Trump is running a hard China line into the elections,” Strickland added.
Investors are also keeping an eye on the U.S. economic recovery, after Trump kept a promise to take executive action if consensus was not reached for the country’s latest stimulus measures.
“I view this as another step-in negotiations rather than a cessation of negotiations, with a still unknown timeline,” JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) analyst Andrew Tyler said in a note.
“If we see the White House take the view that they no longer want to negotiate until after the election, then think we’ll see a wave of GDP downgrades followed by lower realized spending and spikes to unemployment in September through year-end.”

Reliance’s shares fell in mid-July after Chairman Mukesh Ambani said a transaction had been delayed “due to unforeseen circumstances in the energy market and the Covid-19 situation.”
A deal with Reliance would help the world’s biggest crude exporter join the ranks of the top oil refiners and chemical makers. State-owned Aramco is already a major supplier of crude to India, while Reliance sells petroleum products, including gasoline, to the kingdom.
“We are still in discussion with Reliance,” Aramco Chief Executive Officer Amin Nasser said on a call with reporters on Sunday. “The work is still on. We will update our shareholders in due course about the Reliance deal.”
Aramco reported on Sunday that second-quarter net income was down almost 75% from a year earlier. It has been slammed by the roughly 33% drop in oil prices in 2020. The coronavirus pandemic halted travel and business, slashing demand for crude and fuel.
Ambani, the world’s fourth-richest person, said last year that Aramco was set to buy a 20% stake in his company’s refining and petrochemicals business, valuing it at $75 billion.
The Reliance transaction would help Aramco reach its goal of more than doubling refining capacity to between 8 million and 10 million barrels a day. The Saudi firm had refining capacity of 3.6 million barrels a day at the end of last year, including wholly-owned plants and stakes in joint ventures. The gross capacity of facilities in which Aramco has stakes was 6.4 million barrels daily.
The company, officially known as Saudi Arabian Oil Co., is working to start the 400,000 barrel-a-day Jazan refinery on Saudi Arabia’s southern Red Sea coast this year. It also owns the biggest refinery in the U.S. as well as plants in countries such as South Korea and Japan. It’s planning several Chinese ventures.
Reliance’s need for a cash infusion has eased in recent months. The Indian conglomerate raised some $30 billion by attracting investments from the likes of Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB). into its digital unit, Jio Platforms Ltd., and by selling shares to existing stakeholders.

1681,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 09, 2020 09:09PM ET</span>",Asia’s Worst Share Market Just Got Another Jolt,"(Bloomberg) -- There seems to be no let-up in bad news for Philippine stocks -- already the worst performers in Asia this year.Overseas investors dumped a net $138 million of local shares on Friday, the biggest single-day outflow in five years. While the outsized withdrawal likely resulted from one large stock transaction involving a foreign seller, market watchers say the selloff could worsen. That’s after poor containment measures contributed to the Philippines last week surpassing Indonesia as the nation with the highest coronavirus cases in Southeast Asia.
“There is a big possibility that outflows will go on because of our condition,” said Japhet Tantiangco, an analyst at PhilStocks Financial Inc. “The economy is a laggard and we lead the region in infections, which is a big concern for foreign investors.”
The Philippines has had to re-impose a second lockdown on its capital and nearby areas to curb the spread of the virus, a move that threatens to make its economic recovery even more challenging. The nation plunged into a recession after gross domestic product shrank by a record 16.5% from a year earlier in the second quarter.
Total infections climbed to almost 130,000 as of Sunday.
READ: Philippines Needs $31.8 Billion Recovery Plan, Lawmaker Says
Including the $138 million pulled out on Friday, overseas funds have sold $182.5 million of Philippine equities so far this month. That eclipses an outflow of $124.3 million for all of July, which marked a ninth straight month of withdrawals.
A block of 600 million shares of brandy-maker Emperador Inc. offloaded by a foreign investor near the end of Friday’s session contributed to a large daily outflow from the market, according to Manny Cruz, a strategist at Papa Securities Corp. Crossed at 9.10 pesos a share, the block worth 5.46 billion pesos ($111.3 million) was acquired by a local buyer, data compiled by Bloomberg showed.
Selling by foreign funds has contributed to the Philippines Stock Exchange Index’s 25% plunge this year, the biggest in Asia. The broader MSCI Asia Pacific Index is down 1.5%.
Meanwhile, equity investors are struggling to find any positive signs on the earnings front. Analysts have slashed 12-month forward profit estimates for companies on the benchmark 30-stock PSEi gauge by about 24% since the start of 2020, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
This year’s losses have also erased the valuation premium Philippines’ shares typically command over the broader Asian market. While that may be an incentive for some foreigners to jump back in, such inflows could prove short-lived, said Jonathan Ravelas, chief market strategist at BDO Unibank Inc.
“It’s hard to see a sustained reversal in outflows when fundamentals are under threat from rising infections and an economic recession,” he said.

1682,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 09, 2020 08:11PM ET</span>","Fuelled by Volvo, China's Geely seeks launchpad to enter auto giant orbit","By Yilei Sun and Brenda Goh
TAIZHOU, China/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Chinese carmaker Geely plans to use a platform developed with input from Volvo to build new models in Malaysia for its partly owned Proton brand, a strategy that shows how it aims to accelerate its push to become China's first global auto giant.
The yet-to-be-finalised plans for Proton are just one strand of a Geely project to revamp factories at home and abroad using joint platforms it has been perfecting with Volvo since 2013. Geely bought the Swedish brand 10 years ago for $1.8 billion - a deal that raised its international profile and sent shockwaves through the global auto trade. 
Senior Geely officials and engineers told Reuters that a project dubbed Compact Modular Architecture (CMA) will allow them to develop, design and build different types of compact cars with similar mechanical layout faster than before - and at lower cost. 
They said CMA, along with a platform for smaller cars known as B-segment Modular Architecture (BMA) that Geely plans to roll out for Proton, allow them to harness the Swedish automaker's technologies and Geely's capabilities in cost control, supply chain management and local production.
""CMA will be the core of Geely's future architecture design ... We learn technologies and build up talents through developing it,"" said Li Li, vice president at Geely Automobile Research Institute, confirming the Proton plan during an interview in Ningbo, south of Shanghai. Li declined to disclose details of general investment, financial targets or a timetable for expansion plans.
From its lowly foundation in 1986 in Taizhou on the east coast as a maker of refrigerator parts, Geely has grown into one of the biggest players in China, the world's largest auto market accounting for nearly one in every three passenger cars sold around the planet. Geely now sells more than 2 million cars a year across all brands, ranking it not far from the world's top 10 automakers by unit sales.
The CMA platform in particular will allow Geely and Volvo to design vehicles more quickly and cost-effectively, Li said, providing a technological springboard towards a higher market share at a time when the auto industry must embrace a future featuring electric and autonomously driven transport.

GLOBAL AMBITIONS
Like Geely - an anglicisation of the Chinese word for 'lucky' - domestic peers Great Wall Motor (SS:601633) and GAC (SS:601238) have branched out with their own versions of vehicle platforms, harbouring greater ambitions for selling cars in major Western markets.
But grand plans have previously been delayed, or simply cancelled, amid a lack of practical preparedness, analysts have said, against a backdrop of years of trade tensions between China and the United States that have roiled the global economy. At the same time, attention has been diverted to deal with stalling sales at home as the pace of China's growth has slowed.
In its pursuit of global automaker status, Hangzhou-based Geely is now holding talks to merge the Volvo Cars business with its Hong Kong-listed Geely Automobile (HK:0175) - worth about $22 billion by market value, bigger then famed industry names like  Fiat  Chrysler Automobile (MI:FCHA) and Nissan Motor (T:7201).
As well as the 49.9% stake it took in Proton three years ago, the broader Geely group - Zhejiang Geely Holding Group [GEELY.UL], led by Taizhou-born billionaire Li Shufu - now also comprises a 9.7% stake in Germany's  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn) and a majority stake in British sport car brand Lotus.
And while giants from Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203) to Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p) and General Motors Co (N:GM) have followed a similar shared platform projects for their respective brands, Geely's strategy is a first for a Chinese company. 
The automaker plans to develop all its future models for the Geely and Lynk & Co brands on CMA or other related product platforms, like BMA. It is also developing a new architecture to accelerate the launch of pure battery electric vehicles with intelligent connectivity functions, said Li, a former Ford (N:F) engineer.
In addition, Geely wants to shift development of next generations of some popular existing models, like Borui and Emgrand sedans, to those architectures, he said. It takes around 18 months for Geely to significantly change a CMA-based car, versus 24-30 months to do so on a non-CMA-based model. 
Using CMA, plant managers can switch production of different models to maintain smooth overall capacity utilisation rates at production lines, said Oskar Falk, the Volvo-trained head at Geely and Volvo's first joint production site in Taizhou.
The plant already exports Volvo Polestar 2 electric sedans to the United States and Europe, and is preparing to make Volvo's first battery-powered electric vehicle, Falk said.
Geely also plans to start exporting China-made Lynk & Co 01 SUVs to Europe this year.

(Reuters) - Korean automaker  Hyundai Motor  Co (KS:005380) is creating a family of electric vehicles it will sell under the Ioniq brand as part of its drive to become the world's third-largest seller of EVs by 2025, the company said on Sunday.
Hyundai said the elevation of Ioniq from an individual vehicle nameplate to a brand will help support its goal of capturing 10% of global EV sales in 2025.
With electric vehicles still struggling to gain traction in most major markets, Hyundai's main competitors will likely include traditional automakers Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p) and General Motors Co (N:GM), both of which have announced plans to build and sell a million or more electric vehicles a year by 2025.
California-based Tesla Inc (O:TSLA), which makes only electric vehicles, aims to retain its current position as the world's EV leader. Chief Executive Elon Musk has said he expects the company to sell ""a few million"" vehicles in 2025. 
Ioniq was launched four years ago as a vehicle name plate under the Hyundai brand. The compact hatchback was offered with a choice of three powertrains: Conventional gas-electric hybrid, plug-in hybrid and pure battery electric. Those models will continue in production.
Starting in early 2021, Hyundai said it plans to introduce three all-electric models under the Ioniq brand. They include the Ioniq 5, a midsize crossover based on the 2019 Hyundai 45 concept; in 2022, the Ioniq 6 sedan, based on the Hyundai Prophecy concept unveiled earlier this year, and in early 2024, the Ioniq 7, a large crossover.

The three new Ioniq models will be built on a dedicated EV platform known internally as E-GMP, for Electric Global Modular Platform, which will ""enable fast charging capability and plentiful driving range,"" the company said in a statement.

1684,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 09, 2020 07:36PM ET</span>",One in Three U.K. Employers Plans to Cut Jobs in This Quarter,"(Bloomberg) -- One in three U.K. employers plans to cut staff this quarter, highlighting the growing risk of a labor market crisis derailing the post-lockdown recovery as government support is withdrawn.
The problem is particularly acute within private companies, with almost 40% expecting to make layoffs, according to a survey of 2,000 employers by human resources body the CIPD and  Adecco  (SIX:ADEN) Group.
Wage growth also looks set to be subdued. Those bosses who do intend to review salaries anticipate making 1% increases to basic pay, compared with 2% this time last year. Even so, hiring intentions rose, indicating that businesses are reshaping in response to the crisis.
The specter of mass unemployment is looming large over the U.K. economy as it begins its fragile recovery following months of lockdown. While the government has been paying the wages of 9.6 million jobs at a cost of 33.8 billion pounds ($44 billion) as of Aug. 2, it has started to wind down the program, even as many businesses are still struggling. The Bank of England last week warned unemployment will rise to about 7.5% by the end of the year.
“Until now, redundancies have been low -- no doubt due to the Job Retention Scheme -- but we expect to see more redundancies come through this autumn, especially in the private sector once the scheme closes,” said Gerwyn Davies, senior labour market adviser at the CIPD. “This will likely be accompanied by a pay squeeze for workers, which is actually to be welcomed to help preserve jobs. This looks set to be a somber autumn.”

1690,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 09, 2020 09:11AM ET</span>",Barclays being probed by UK privacy watchdog on accusations of spying on staff,"By Kanishka Singh
(Reuters) -  Barclays  Plc (L:BARC) is being probed by the United Kingdom's privacy watchdog, the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), over allegations that the British bank spied on its staff, the agency said on Sunday.
Earlier this year, Barclays said it was changing a system that the bank was piloting, which tracked how employees spent their time at work, after critical media reports accused the bank of spying on its staff.
The ICO said on Sunday a formal probe was ongoing but it could not say when the investigation would conclude.
""People expect that they can keep their personal lives private and that they are also entitled to a degree of privacy in the workplace,"" an ICO spokesman said.
""If organisations wish to monitor their employees, they should be clear about its purpose and that it brings real benefits. Organisations also need to make employees aware of the nature, extent and reasons for any monitoring"", he added.
The probe was reported earlier by The Sunday Telegraph newspaper.
Late in February, Barclays said it was changing how it used the Sapience software so it would now track only anonymised data, in response to staff feedback that the system was intrusive.
Sapience gives companies ""insights into work patterns"" and tracks employee productivity by monitoring their computer usage, according to its website.
Such systems are becoming increasingly common among banks and other financial firms, which use voice recognition and other behaviour-tracking tools to watch for unusual behaviour that could indicate misconduct.

In 2017, Barclays faced widespread criticism when it rolled out a system known as OccupEye, which tracked how long people spent at their desks.

""In the retail business in particular, there will be more partnerships with us. There are good examples abroad of how insurance and banking services can be merged, such as Ping An in China,"" SonntagsZeitung quoted him as saying in an interview.
""Working with third parties is interesting, but we always have to be careful to protect the strength of our brand. This is particularly important for very wealthy customers.""
He said cooperation projects may cover insurance, credit cards or events, which could help improve access to younger retail clients.
Rohner, whose term ends next year, said the bank's succession planning continued. ""I am confident that we will find a good solution in a timely way,"" he said, adding the candidate's name would be announced as soon as a decision was made.
Rohner said the government and private sector should be planning now how to help companies while the coronavirus pandemic continues, noting emergency Swiss state-backed loans that provided quick liquidity would not suffice.

""It would be wrong to believe that the aid we have decided so far has let us already master the economic consequences of the crisis. I suggest we start thinking now about how we can give the economy new impetus. The crisis will preoccupy us all of next year.""

(Reuters) - Eastman Kodak Co's $765 million loan agreement with the U.S. government to produce pharmaceutical ingredients has been put on hold due to ""recent allegations of wrongdoing,"" the U.S. International Development Finance Corp (DFC) said.
Earlier this week, senior Democratic lawmakers asked federal regulators to investigate securities transactions made by the company and its executives around the time it learned it could receive the government loan.
""Recent allegations of wrongdoing raise serious concerns,"" DFC said late on Friday in a tweet. 
""We will not proceed any further unless these allegations are cleared,"" the DFC said. It was referring to a letter of interest it signed on July 28 with Kodak.
President Donald Trump on Tuesday said the government would investigate the circumstances surrounding the announcement of the loan, which will help the photographic equipment maker shift into making pharmaceuticals at its U.S. factories.
Kodak shares surged more than 1,000% last week after the loan was announced, generating a windfall for executives, some of whom had received options one day earlier. 
Lawmakers said they had ""serious concerns"" about the transactions and asked the Securities and Exchange Commission to investigate the circumstances surrounding the matter. They cited growing concerns about insider trading.
The company said it had appointed a special committee of independent directors of its board to conduct an internal review.
""The internal review will be conducted for the Committee by Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld LLP,"" Eastman Kodak said in a statement.

1693,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 08, 2020 01:20PM ET</span>",Coronavirus punishes Warren Buffett as Berkshire Hathaway takes big writedown,"By Jonathan Stempel
(Reuters) - Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) Inc on Saturday announced a $9.8 billion writedown and 10,000 job losses at its Precision Castparts aircraft parts unit, as the coronavirus pandemic caused widespread pain at Warren Buffett's conglomerate.
Despite the writedown, Berkshire said second-quarter net income surged 87% because of gains in stock investments such as Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) as markets rebounded.
Operating profit fell 10%, cushioned by a temporary bump at the Geico auto insurer, as the pandemic caused ""relatively minor to severe"" damage to most of Berkshire's more than 90 operating businesses.
""The writedown was prudent,"" said Cathy Seifert, an equity analyst at CFRA Research. ""It's a recognition of what the market has long believed, that the purchase price was rich, and the integration not as smooth as many would have hoped.""
Berkshire, which paid $32.1 billion for Precision in 2016 in its largest acquisition, and which Buffett at the time called a steep price, said COVID-19 caused airlines to slash plane orders, significantly curbing demand for Precision's products.
Buffett himself soured on airlines during the quarter, selling $6 billion of their stock and telling shareholders on May 2 the industry's future had become ""much less clear to me.""
Berkshire said Precision, which also makes industrial parts, saw revenue fall by one-third and plans an ""aggressive restructuring"" to shrink operations. Precision ended 2019 with 33,417 employees, and has shed 30% of its workforce.
During the quarter, Buffett, who turns 90 on Aug. 30, also took advantage of Berkshire's underperforming shares by repurchasing $5.1 billion of stock, even as the pandemic reduced other companies' ability to buy back their own shares. 
Berkshire's stock has significantly underperformed broader markets since the end of 2018, and Seifert said investors should welcome the buybacks.
""Berkshire tends to go against the grain, and when so many companies suspended buybacks, Berkshire did the opposite,"" she said. ""The market should react positively, because it shows Berkshire is confident in its prospects."" 
Those repurchases confirmed Berkshire's hint in a July 8 regulatory filing it had become more aggressive with buybacks after loosening its buyback policy in 2018.
PANDEMIC DAMAGE
Berkshire businesses suffering from the pandemic also include the BNSF railroad, which saw lower shipping volumes, and retailers including See's candies that temporarily closed stores.
Companies in which Berkshire recently made large investments have also been struggling.
Berkshire recorded a $513 million loss on its 26.6% stake in Kraft Heinz Co (O:KHC), after the food company took several writedowns including for Maxwell House and Oscar Mayer.
Meanwhile, Occidental Petroleum Corp (NYSE:OXY), where Berkshire invested $10 billion last August, has also pummeled by sinking oil prices.
Berkshire's overall quarterly net income rose to $26.3 billion, or $16,314 per Class A share, from $14.07 billion, or $8,608 per share, a year earlier. That followed a $49.75 billion first-quarter loss.
An accounting rule requires Berkshire to report unrealized stock gains and losses with net results, causing huge swings that Buffett considers meaningless.
Second-quarter operating profit fell to $5.53 billion, or about $3,463 per Class A share, from $6.14 billion, or $3,757 per share, a year earlier.
Revenue fell 11% to $56.8 billion, despite gains in some businesses including Duracell batteries, which rose 16%.
Geico's pretax underwriting profit increased fivefold to $2.06 billion because people drove less, resulting in significantly fewer accident claims.
But Berkshire said Geico could suffer underwriting losses for the rest of the year, as it awards drivers $2.5 billion of credits on auto and motorcycle policy renewals.
Berkshire ended June with a record $146.6 billion of cash and equivalents, and bought just $797 million of equities in the quarter.

Buffett has since deployed some cash, agreeing to buy some Dominion Energy gas assets for $4 billion and adding more than $2 billion of Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) stock.

1694,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 08, 2020 06:46AM ET</span>","Point/Counterpoint: As Apple Nears $2 Trillion Value, Just Right or Too Hot?","By Liz Moyer and Yasin Ebrahim
Investing.com -- Strange times have set in on Wall Street. . . Valuations appear to have been banished. ""Buy the dips"" are in. And if all else fails, the ""Fed has your back,"" has been running narrative among investors both new and old.
The remarkable rise in Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) valuation, however, supports calls to at least give a cursory nod to the possibility that the tech giant is running too hot.
Apple's market value stood at $999.5 billion a little under five months ago on Mar. 16, and now is on the cusp of more than doubling. The shares trade near $445, driven by investors who see pent up demand for upcoming device upgrades and strong sales despite pandemic lockdowns. A plan to split the stock 4-to-1 could propel Apple's market value above the $2 trillion mark.
Investing.com's Liz Moyer writes about the bull case for Apple, while Yasin Ebrahim explains how Apple is running too hot. This is Point/Counterpoint.
The Bull Case
A bet on Apple is a bet on the roll out of the next generation network, 5G. Apple is planning to introduce 5G devices in the coming months. That should certainly appeal to need-it-first consumers, who will undoubtedly race to snap up new iPhones.
Pent up interest in the iPhone 12 sets the stage, according to Wedbush analyst Dan Ives, in a note last month in which he set a new price target for Apple shares around $450. It has already approached that loftier level. 
Covid-19 lockdowns around the world threatened to dampen Apple's prospects, but things rebounded after the lockdowns lifted, especially in China's massive consumer market. The supply chain troubles also loosened up, allowing Apple to move ahead with the 5G handset rollout.
Apple plans to offer multiple versions that will run on 5G chips. That will inevitably push Apple's market value above $2 trillion, as ""given the 5G tailwinds and services momentum potential over the coming years,"" Ives wrote in a note. He estimated that roughly 350 million of some 950 million iPhones out in the world are due for an upgrade.
Morgan Stanley recently called out Apple's trade-in programs as a competitive advantage, saying they can fund one-third of iPhone purchases over the next three years.
Apple's market value topped $1 trillion in market cap for the first time in 2018, faltered a bit and then surged again last year. Its remarkable near-doubling since then has also made it the heftiest stock in the S&P 500. At $450 a share, with a market value of $1.925 trillion, Apple is now 6.7% of the index, compared with 6.4% for  IBM  (NYSE:IBM) some 35 years ago, according to data compiled by Bloomberg and S&P Dow Jones Indices.
Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is 5.9% of the S&P and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is 4.9%.
The stock is up another 53% this year, the most of the biggest big-cap stocks except for Amazon. Consumers are still buying iPhones, iPads and computers even though they have been hunkered down at home to avoid spreading the virus. The shares hit a fresh 52-week high this week.
D.A. Davidson analyst Tom Forte recently set a price target for the stock of $480, which implies a market value overall of $2.05 trillion.
Third fiscal quarter earnings topped estimates by 54 cents, with earnings per share of $2.58 rising from $2.18 a year ago on revenue of $59.7 billion. Revenue is up 10.9% over last year. With $33 billion of cash on its books, Apple has plenty of room to return money to shareholders.
But perhaps the best argument in favor of Apple longs is the company's plan to split 4-for-1 later this month.
That will make the stock more accessible to new investors, especially those who found $450 or so a share an unacceptably high entry price for a single share. Apple has split in the past, most recently a 7-for-1 split in June 2014. Back then, shares traded at $93.70.
The Bear Case
While an upbeat second-quarter report and the upcoming launch its 5G-enabled iPhones justify some of the froth in the tech giant's valuation, some have questioned whether the fundamentals of Apple's  business have changed materially in last five months to add a nearly $1 trillion to its value.
Bank of America analyst Wamsi Mohan doesn't think so.
Earlier this week, Mohan cut his rating on the Apple to neutral from buy, citing a more balanced risk-to-reward profile for the stock as it traded at its highest premium to the S&P 500 in 10 years.
Mohan brandished a laundry list of headwinds facing the stock including a risk to margins, regulatory uncertainty, and slowing services growth.
The launch of 5G handsets is not the panacea that many believe it will be. 5G iPhones will be more expensive to make - relative to a 4G handset – and eat into Apple's margin. While any attempt to plug the gap by raising iPhone prices will likely hurt volumes, Mohan said.
The regulatory scrutiny and developer backlash over Apple's antitrust practices in its App Store is also cause for concern.
The App Store, which is a key part of Apple's push into services as it seeks to wean itself off from iPhone dependency, is unlikely to continue its strong yet ""unsustainable"" growth next year, Mohan added. 
While there aren't many on Wall Street willing to jump off the Apple optimism bandwagon, BofA's Mohan is not alone following his shift to the side lines.
Goldman Sachs recently urged investors to ""avoid"" Apple's stock, citing uncertainty over the timing of the 5G launch and a somewhat murky outlook ahead.
""(W)e see Apple's recent stock performance and absolute trading level as unsustainable and would continue to recommend that investors avoid the stock,"" Goldman Sachs said in a note last month as the bank reiterated its sell rating on Apple.
The Wall Street bank estimated that 2021 EPS will be 16% below consensus amid pressure from slowing unit sales, average selling prices, and unit growth."

U.S. pressure on Huawei's suppliers has made it impossible for the company's HiSilicon chip division to keep making the chipsets, key components for mobile phone, Richard Yu, CEO of Huawei's Consumer Business Unit was quoted as saying at the launch of the company's new Mate 40 handset.

The United States is also seeking the extradition from Canada of Huawei's chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, on charges of bank fraud.
In May the U.S. Commerce Department issued orders that required suppliers of software and manufacturing equipment to refrain from doing business with Huawei without first obtaining a license.
""From Sept. 15 onward, our flagship Kirin processors cannot be produced,"" Yu said, according to Caixin. ""Our AI-powered chips also cannot be processed. This is a huge loss for us.""
Huawei's HiSilicon division relies on software from U.S. companies such as Cadence Design (NASDAQ:CDNS) Systems Inc or Synopsys (NASDAQ:SNPS) Inc to design its chips and it outsources the production to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC), which uses equipment from U.S. companies. 
Huawei declined comment on the Caixin report. TSMC, Cadence and Synopsys did not immediately respond to email requests for comment.
HiSilicon produces a wide range of chips including its line of Kirin processors, which power only Huawei smartphones and are the only Chinese processors that can rival those from Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) in quality.
""Huawei began exploring the chip sector over 10 years ago, starting from hugely lagging behind, to slightly lagging behind, to catching up, and then to a leader,"" Yu was quoted as saying. ""We invested massive resources for R&D, and went through a difficult process.""

1696,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 08, 2020 03:10AM ET</span>",Chinese EV maker Xpeng files for U.S. listing after rival surges,"BEIJING (Reuters) - Chinese electric vehicle (EV) maker Xpeng Inc, backed by  Alibaba  (N:BABA) and  Xiaomi  (OTC:XIACF) Corp (HK:1810), has filed to list its shares in New York, seeking to ride enthusiasm for EVs even as U.S.-China relations are strained.
The move, announced on Friday, comes as share prices of EV makers including Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) and Nio Inc (N:NIO) have surged in recent months. 
Shares in Xpeng rival  Li Auto Inc  (O:LI) soared more than 50% following its debut on Nasdaq on July 30, after the Chinese automaker sold shares to investors in its $1.1 billion IPO.
The exuberance contrasts with relations between Washington and Beijing, which are at their worst in decades over accusations of spying, a trade war, the coronavirus and Hong Kong. 
Before six-year-old Xpeng sought permission to list on the New York Stock Exchange, it raised $900 million from investors in its latest funding round. This followed $400 million in fund-raising in November. The latest investors include Alibaba, Qatar Investment Authority and Abu Dhabi's sovereign wealth fund Mubadala.
Guangzhou-based Xpeng, led by chief executive He Xiaopeng, has sold over 20,000 electric vehicles, including new P7 sedans and G3. It builds cars in two factories in China.
Funds from the IPO will go towards research and development in areas such as intelligent vehicle technologies and sales expansion, the company said in a filing to U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
Xpeng intends to list its shares under the symbol ""XPEV"".
Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), J.P. Morgan, and  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) are the underwriters for the listing.

1697,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 08, 2020 12:00AM ET</span>","WarnerMedia restructures to focus on HBO Max, senior executives out","By Kenneth Li
(Reuters) - WarnerMedia executives Bob Greenblatt and Kevin Reilly, who oversaw the creation of the HBO Max streaming business, will leave as part of a broad restructuring focused around the streaming service, the company said on Friday.
The shake-up also includes the consolidation of film and TV studios under Warner Bros Chief Executive Ann Sarnoff.
The restructuring marks the first major action taken by WarnerMedia CEO Jason Kilar, a former Amazon.com (O:AMZN) executive who built Hulu. 
""We're laser focusing on HBO Max and lifting it up in the organization,"" Kilar said in an interview on Friday.
Andy Forssell, general manager of HBO Max, will now head a newly created HBO Max operating business unit, Kilar added.
Parent AT&T Inc (N:T) hired Kilar to take charge at WarnerMedia as it battles with Netflix (O:NFLX) and Walt  Disney 's (N:DIS) Disney+ for streaming video customers. 
The wireless carrier, which has invested heavily to transform itself into a media and telecommunications conglomerate, reported 36 million subscribers for both its premium TV channel HBO and HBO Max in the second quarter.
Disney+, which launched in November last year, had 60.5 million paying customers as of Monday. Netflix, which launched its streaming service in 2007, ended the second quarter with close to 193 million paying customers globally.
Media companies have been hard hit by severe drops in ad sales as marketers reel in spending due to the global coronavirus outbreak. The pandemic has also halted production of original material, starving streaming services of new content needed to fuel subscriptions. 
Hollywood studios have been forced by the pandemic to find ways to recoup lost sales. Some have released feature films directly to consumer over streaming services.
Comcast Corp's (O:CMCSA) Universal Pictures recently negotiated a deal with cinema chain AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc (N:AMC) to allow the studio to release films directly to consumers after just three weeks in theatres, down from the usual average of three months.
Kilar said WarnerMedia continued to support theatrical releases for films including director Christopher Nolan's spy action film ""Tenet"" and ""Wonder Woman 1984,"" but saw room for change.
""It's fair to say we all want to lean into the future. If you don't that’s not a good strategy,"" he said. ""Where I think that takes us is shorter windows than historically the case.""
AT&T's revenue from the WarnerMedia segment, including HBO, fell 22.7% to $6.8 billion in the second quarter, with the pandemic having a $1.5 billion impact on sales.

WarnerMedia also said on Friday it would cut jobs, without disclosing the number of employees affected.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - As the S&P 500 approaches fresh highs, some investors hope to pick up bargains in the battered U.S. real estate sector, where values of some major stocks have been cut in half this year.
Coronavirus-fueled lockdowns and a major shift toward working from home have weighed on residential and retail U.S. real estate investment trusts. The sector has slid 7% this year compared with a 3% gain on the S&P 500. 
Yet investors say stocks in the sector could jump if a coronavirus vaccine loosens the pandemic's hold on the U.S. economy. 
""You’re going to find more attractive spots in the REIT space than you will in some areas of the market like technology, that have the growth but are getting expensive,” said Mark Freeman, chief investment officer at Socorro Asset Management.
Among his largest positions is  Alexandria Real Estate Equities  Inc (N:ARE), which rents space for medical research, and  Prologis  Inc (N:PLD), which owns warehouses used for ecommerce fulfillment by companies such as Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN). 
Drugmakers will likely have tens of millions of doses of coronavirus vaccines in the early part of next year, Anthony Fauci, the top U.S. infectious diseases official, told Reuters in an interview on Wednesday.
Such a breakthrough would be a boon for companies like mall landlord Simon Property Group Inc (N:SPG), said John Creswell, executive managing director at Duff & Phelps Investment Management Co. 
Shares of the company are down 58.2% for the year to date and trade at a trailing price to earnings ratio of 9.6, less than half of their 52-week high of 22.9. 
The company, which is expected to report earnings on Aug. 10, is managing the effects of the pandemic by capping its spending until consumers once again feel comfortable congregating in large groups, Creswell said. 
""They're showing that they can live with COVID, not just get through COVID,"" Creswell said. 
An extension of unemployment benefits and another stimulus bill would likely provide an outsized lift to retail and residential REITs that have lagged hot sectors such as data centers, said Michael Knott, Green Street’s head of U.S. REIT Research. 
""Given that consumption is such a critical aspect of GDP, bridging toward an environment that starts to look more normal will be pretty important to the retail and residential space,"" he said. 
There are plenty reasons to be skeptical of a quick rebound. Enhanced unemployment benefits lapsed last week, and Congress has, as of Friday, had failed to pass another stimulus bill that would provide relief. Those enhanced benefits had funded continued spending for many of the more than 20 million Americans who have lost their jobs since February. 
More than 30% of mall-based businesses and office tenants are expected to withhold at least part of their rent payments this year, according to estimates from Green Street Advisors. 
Valuations in the sector also tend to vary widely, thanks to rallies in warehouse and data-center stocks that have skewed averages higher. Data center operator Digital Realty (NYSE:DLR) Trust, for example, is up 31% for the year to date and trades at a P/E of 55.2. On the whole, companies in the sector trade at 37 times earnings, compared to 24 for the S&P 500.
Still, Freeman of Socorro Asset Management has raised his exposure to the REIT sector, expecting that consumers will return to physical retail stores and workers will return to offices once the pandemic is over. 
He also plans on adding to his exposure to apartments and retail centers, in part due to more attractive yields than those available from government or corporate bonds. 

""We are going to see how fundamentals play out before we become much more aggressive, but we're starting to get much more comfortable with the space,"" he said.

1699,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 07, 2020 08:15PM ET</span>",UPS plans heavy holiday fees amid coronavirus-related shipment surge,"(Reuters) -  United Parcel  Service Inc (NYSE:UPS) plans to impose big fees on large shippers sending significantly more packages through its system during the holiday season amid the coronavirus pandemic, according to a new fee schedule released on Friday.
The novel coronavirus outbreak has disrupted operations at UPS and other large delivery firms - swamping their networks with everything from food to furniture, while putting the brakes on profit-making shipments between businesses.
UPS said the new fees could total as much as $3 a package for ground shipments and other lower-priced shipping options and up to $4 a package for air shipments bound for residences. The hikes were first reported by the Wall Street Journal. 
UPS said the surcharges will apply from mid-November until mid-January and are designed to apply only to customers who ship more than 25,000 packages a week.
The charges escalate as customers send 110%, 200% and 300% more shipments than their average weekly shipping volume in February. 
""This could be the last we see of free shipping,"" said Cathy Morrow Roberson, founder of Logistics Trends & Insights.
She said the price increases are yet another blow to struggling retailers, who have seen store sales plummet during the pandemic. Higher holiday shipping costs could force them absorb the extra fees, stop subsidizing free shipping, or raise prices. 
UPS declined to say what percentage of their customers would be affected. 
Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), the largest customer of UPS and a rising delivery rival, declined to comment. 
UPS and rivals FedEx Corp (NYSE:FDX) and DHL each have taken steps to manage the boom in lower-margin, e-commerce deliveries, which has required them to add labor and secure more space on planes, trucks and trains. 
The U.S. Postal Service, which also delivers large numbers of packages, also is grappling with a significant surge in volume. 

""They don't have an infinite amount of capacity,"" Morrow Roberson said of U.S. package carriers.
