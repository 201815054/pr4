NEW YORK (Reuters) - WeWork owner The We Company faces strong headwinds in achieving its goal of launching an initial public offering (IPO) by the end of the year after postponing it this month, fund managers and capital markets professionals said.
The U.S. office-sharing startup was getting ready to launch an investor road show for its IPO this week, before making the last-minute decision on Monday to stand down following a lackluster reception from investors, people familiar with the matter said.
Reuters reported last week that We Company was considering seeking a valuation in its IPO of between $10 billion and $12 billion, a dramatic discount to the $47 billion valuation it achieved in January.
We Company is hoping it can kick off its IPO as early as next month, once it has updated its quarterly earnings with what it hopes to be a strong financial performance between July and September, according to people familiar with its thinking. We Company declined to comment. 
However, it runs the risk of coming up against weak IPO market demand because many fund managers become more risk-averse in the fourth quarter, as time runs out to make changes to their portfolio before they close their books for the year.
""WeWork's decision to delay its IPO only days before the road show, until sometime before year-end, hinders its ability to control the narrative,"" said Dan Morgan, senior portfolio manager at Synovus Trust in Atlanta.
We Company is looking to raise at least $3 billion in its IPO. Since 2001, there have been 21 such sizeable U.S. IPOs which raised in excess of $3 billion, of which only two were in October, one came in November and none in December, according to financial data provider Refinitiv. 
This puts the heavily loss-making company in a bind. It must raise at least $3 billion in an IPO before the end of 2019 as part of a $6 billion debt deal it agreed with banks last month, or find alternative funding, according to people familiar with the matter. 
""Going out at the end of the year means the overlap of Thanksgiving to Christmas. No one is home. They need to go out and they likely will in October or early November,"" said Duncan Davidson, general partner at Bullpen Capital, an early-stage venture capital investment firm.
We Company's chief executive, Israeli-born Adam Neumann, is also reluctant to pursue an IPO around the Jewish holidays, according to people familiar with the matter. Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur fall on Sept. 29-Oct. 1 and Oct. 8-9 respectively.
CEO 'HUMBLED'
We Company's decision to delay its IPO indicates it did not feel confident that the corporate governance changes it unveiled on Friday, slightly loosening Neumann's grip on the company, were enough to woo investors concerned about its lack of a path to profitability. 
In the run-up to the launch of its IPO, We Company faced concerns about its corporate governance standards, as well as the sustainability of its business model, which relies on a mix of long-term liabilities and short-term revenue, and how such a model would weather an economic downturn.
In a sign of contrition, Neumann told staff on Tuesday he had been ""humbled"" by the IPO effort so far and said he had lessons to learn about running a public company, the Financial Times reported, citing people who saw the presentation.

""Coming back, retapping the IPO market and trying to get a better reception is going to be about the company showing more progress than it's shown this time, to make investors more comfortable with WeWork,"" said Kathleen Smith, principal at Renaissance Capital, a provider of institutional research and IPO ETFs.

2,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 18, 2019 02:05AM ET</span>",Apple says $14 billion EU tax order 'defies reality and common sense',"By Foo Yun Chee
LUXEMBOURG (Reuters) - The European Union's order for Apple (O:AAPL) to pay 13 billion euros ($14 billion) in back taxes to Ireland ""defies reality and common sense,"" the U.S. company said on Tuesday, as it launched a legal challenge against the 2016 ruling.
The iPhone maker also accused the executive European Commission of using its powers to combat state aid ""to retrofit changes to national law,"" in effect trying to change the international tax system and in the process creating legal uncertainty for businesses.
Apple's arguments at the General Court, Europe's second-highest, came after the EU executive in 2016 said the tech giant benefited from illegal state aid due to two Irish tax rulings which artificially reduced its tax burden for over two decades.
The case is key to European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager's crackdown on sweetheart deals for multinationals, a campaign which has also led to action against Starbucks (O:SBUX),  Fiat  (MI:FCHA), Engie (PA:ENGIE), Amazon (O:AMZN) and others.
Apple's Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri led a six-strong delegation to the court where a panel of five judges will hear arguments from both sides, as well as Ireland, Luxembourg, Poland and the EFTA Surveillance Authority, over two days.
""The Commission contends that essentially all of Apple's profits from all of its sales outside the Americas must be attributed to two branches in Ireland,"" Apple's lawyer Daniel Beard told the court.
He said the fact the iPhone, the iPad, the App Store, other Apple products and services and key intellectual property rights were developed in the United States, and not in Ireland, showed the flaws in the Commission's case.
""The branches' activities did not involve creating, developing or managing those rights. Based on the facts of this case, the primary line defies reality and common sense,"" Beard said.
""The activities of these two branches in Ireland simply could not be responsible for generating almost all of Apple's profits outside the Americas.""
Beard dismissed criticism of the 0.005% tax rate paid by Apple's main Irish unit in 2014, which was cited by the Commission in its decision, saying the regulator was just seeking ""headlines by quoting tiny numbers"".
Paying an average global tax rate of 26%, Apple has said it is the largest taxpayer worldwide and is now paying around 20 billion euros in U.S. taxes on the same profits that the Commission said should have been taxed in Ireland.
In its current financial quarter, Apple expects revenue of $61-64 billion and a gross margin of 37.5-38.5%.
Ireland, whose economy has benefited from investment by multinational companies attracted by low tax rates, is also challenging the Commission's decision.
""As Ireland has already emphasized, it undermines legal certainty if state aid measures are used to retrofit changes to national law ... and legal certainty is a key principle of EU law; one upon which businesses depend,"" Beard said.
""Some may want to change the international tax system; but that is a tax law issue – not state aid,"" he said.
Ireland said it had been the subject of entirely unjustified criticism and that the Apple tax case was due to a mismatch between the Irish and U.S. tax systems.
""The Commission's decision is fundamentally flawed,"" Paul Gallagher, lawyer for Ireland, told the court.
Lawyers for the Commission will also make their case on Tuesday. The court is expected to rule in the coming months, with the losing party likely to appeal to the EU Court of Justice and a final judgment could take several years.
The joint Apple cases are T-778/16 Ireland v Commission and T-892/16 Apple Sales International and Apple Operations Europe v Commission."

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Confidence among companies in Asia lifted slightly in the September quarter from 10-year lows, but most firms do not plan on hiring or expect business to pick up as they see a risk of a global recession looming, a Thomson Reuters/INSEAD survey found.
The Thomson Reuters/INSEAD Asian Business Sentiment Index tracking firms' six-month outlook rose five points to 58 in the survey.
A reading above 50 means optimistic respondents outnumbered pessimists.
The latest showing, though, means the index has not risen above the mid-60s for a year and is one of the seven weakest readings since the 2008-2009 global financial crisis.
""We are in a state of almost permanent uncertainty, which is not leading yet to a crisis but I think at some point we are going to see the cost of it,"" said Antonio Fatas, a Singapore-based economics professor at global business school INSEAD.
""Some investments are going to be postponed, some investments are going to be stopped and little by little the engine of growth is going to slow down.""
Respondents rated a global recession as the top risk, overhauling trade-war fears which had topped the table for the previous six quarters.
A total of 102 companies from a range of sectors responded to the survey, conducted in 11 Asia-Pacific countries where 45% of the world's population lives and almost a third of global gross domestic product is generated.
Participants included firms from automaking to technology such as Canon Inc (T:7751), SoftBank Group Corp (T:9984) and  Hero MotoCorp  Ltd (NS:HROM).
WAIT AND SEE
The survey was conducted from Aug. 30 to Sept. 13, as global markets rallied on signs of a thaw in U.S.-China trade tensions.
The trade war has also proven a boon for some, as businesses relocate from China to Southeast Asia and elsewhere to avoid tariffs.
However, cool responses on hiring plans and the sales outlook suggest that any optimism is muted, and unlikely to be solid enough to drive investment and spending.
More than two-thirds of respondents plan on cutting staff or at best holding numbers steady in the next six months. Only 39% expect their sales volumes to rise.
""It's about not over-committing on expansion plans...it's about being prudent,"" said Suresh Sidhu, chief executive officer of edotco Group, a telecoms infrastructure firm headquartered in Kuala Lumpur, with business across south and southeast Asia.
""I don't see people stopping, I just see people thinking about stopping. We definitely have not scaled up very aggressive plans...in times of great complexity and unpredictability, people generally don't spend.""
Economic indicators also suggest a gloomy outlook.
Rising global protectionism could shave 0.8% from the world's economic output next year, the International Monetary Fund said last week.
Flagging demand has already flayed Asian firms such as  Samsung Electronics Co Ltd  (KS:005930), whose profit halved for the June quarter, and automakers from Japan's Mazda Motor Corp (T:7261) to India's  Tata Motors Ltd  (NS:TAMO).
And data released this month showed China's economic woes deepened in August, with growth in industrial production at its weakest in more than 17 years, while U.S manufacturing also shrank.
Alvin Liew, senior economist at Singapore's United Overseas Bank, said the trade war is the biggest driver of the slowdown that will probably deepen unless a breakthrough in negotiations can recharge business confidence and investment.
""I don't think anybody has the kind of delusion that both countries will come to a full-scale agreement and the world will turn into a better place after that,"" he said.
""But there's still some hope holding out and some optimism that they could do an interim trade deal...something to put some certainty back,"" Liew said. ""At the end of the day both sides know that this is not good overall.""
Note: Companies surveyed can change from quarter to quarter."

(Reuters) - New York became the second state to ban flavored e-cigarettes on Tuesday after its Democratic governor called for emergency action in response to concerns about their rising use among teens and a nationwide spate of lung illnesses.
Governor Andrew Cuomo on Sunday called for an urgent meeting of the state's Public Health and Health Planning Council to consider the proposed ban.
The panel on Tuesday voted to adopt the prohibition, which applies to all flavored e-cigarettes besides menthol, Cuomo's office said in a statement.
The state Department of Health pledged to provide retailers with a two-week grace period before conducting site visits to enforce the ban starting on Oct. 7.
New York is the second state in the nation to introduce such a ban, after Michigan did so earlier this month. 
""It is undeniable that vaping companies are deliberately using flavors like bubblegum, Captain Crunch and cotton candy to get young people hooked on e-cigarettes - it's a public health crisis and it ends today,"" Cuomo said in a statement.
The share of high school students using e-cigarettes has more than doubled over the past two years, with 27.5% reporting they had used an e-cigarette in the past month, according to preliminary federal data released last week. 
Last week, the Trump administration announced plans to remove all flavored e-cigarettes from store shelves.
THC BLAMED
Nearly 400 people around the country have been stricken with a lung illness that is potentially vaping-related, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Six have died.
Investigators have said they are trying to understand what causes the illnesses. 
Michael Frennier, president of the New York State Vapor Association, criticized the New York ban, saying the recent spike in deadly lung illnesses was tied to illicit vaping of the marijuana component THC, not use of flavored nicotine.
""It's kind of like having a mayonnaise outbreak of E.coli and the politicians come forth and they say 'We're going to fix this to protect the people of our state and we're going to ban peanut butter tomorrow morning,'"" Frennier said.
Meanwhile, health officials have warned people against buying vaping products on the street or using marijuana-derived oil. They have said people should avoid inhaling vitamin E acetate, an ingredient found in some vaping products.
New York state Health Commissioner Dr. Howard Zucker is evaluating a proposal to extend the ban on flavored e-cigarettes to cover menthol, which was excluded from the prohibition approved on Tuesday, Cuomo's office said.
Juul Labs Inc, the leading U.S. e-cigarette maker, has insisted that it ""never marketed to youth, period,"" although the company has said it regretted that some of its early advertising ""was executed in a way that was perceived as appealing to minors.""

On Tuesday, Juul Labs spokesman Ted Kwong said the company agreed with the need for ""aggressive category-wide action on flavored products,"" adding that it ""will fully comply with local laws."" Juul last year pulled many of its flavors from retail stores and suspended its social media accounts in an effort to curb use among teenagers.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. banking regulator on Tuesday proposed easing a rule requiring banks to set aside cash to safeguard derivatives trades between affiliates, marking one of the biggest wins for Wall Street lenders under the business-friendly Trump administration.
The proposal, by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, could potentially free $40 billion across the nation's largest banks, according to a 2018 survey by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA), the global trade group that has been lobbying for the rule change for years.
The proposal is subject to public comment and will likely face resistance from Democratic lawmakers and consumer groups, who have warned that chipping away at regulations put in place following the 2007-2009 financial crisis could sew the seeds of the next one.
Countries across the globe introduced a slew of rules to rein in the global over-the-counter derivatives market after big bets on credit swaps brought firms including Lehman Brothers and AIG (NYSE:AIG) to their knees. 
These rules included requiring banks to secure trades with cash or margin upfront and additional margin to cover price moves. Tuesday's proposal would scrap the requirement for affiliates within the same bank group to post upfront margin when trading derivatives with one another.
FDIC Chairman Jelena McWilliams, a Trump appointee, said large banks now have multiple checks and buffers in place, and that repealing the ""inter-affiliate"" margin requirement could help free up bank liquidity.
Industry groups hailed the move, which came after years of lobbying by some of the nation's biggest banks, including JPMorgan Chase (N:JPM) and Goldman Sachs (N:GS).
Kevin Fromer, president and CEO of the Financial Services Forum, which represents big bank CEOs, said the original rule ""put U.S. banks, consumers and businesses at a serious disadvantage."" Tuesday's ""proposal reflects common-sense reforms that aim to help level the playing field,"" he added.
At the same meeting, the FDIC also proposed delaying rules that would require smaller funds to post margin for derivatives transactions. The proposal brings the FDIC in line with the Basel Committee of global banking regulators, which already agreed to postpone to September 2021 that requirement for the smallest firms.
The regulator also proposed relief for banks transitioning away from the London interbank offered rate (LIBOR), which is to be phased out after 2021. The proposed rule will allow banks to move existing trades to the new Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) without having to treat them as new transactions, saving banks from a major operational headache.
Other banking regulators are expected to propose similar measures soon.
For years, banks have complained that the U.S. requirement to post ""inter-affiliate"" margin puts them on uneven footing with foreign counterparts, as well as with nonbanks. They also say it is redundant to set aside funds to cover transactions made within the same company.
Banks typically trade swaps between their affiliates to centralize their exposure to manage their risk more efficiently, ISDA said in a statement, adding that any change ""would not affect"" upfront margin posted on trades with third parties.
Some Democratic, as well as Republican lawmakers, are sympathetic to banks' complaints. But the top Democrats on both the House and Senate banking committees wrote to regulators in August urging them to abandon any plan to ease the rule. They said it could encourage banks to shift risk from overseas affiliates to the United States, where banks are backed by federal deposit insurance.
""The FDIC should not adopt this proposal, and I will continue to work to prevent its implementation,"" Democratic Representative Maxine Waters, chairwoman of the House Financial Services Committee, said in a statement.

FDIC Commissioner Martin Gruenberg, a Democrat, on Tuesday opposed the proposal, saying it would expose banks to heightened prudential risks and could put taxpayers at risk.

8,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 17, 2019 08:00PM ET</span>","Ethiopian crash victims want 737 MAX documents from Boeing, FAA","By Tracy Rucinski 
CHICAGO (Reuters) - A lawyer for victims of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 said on Tuesday he wants Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co and the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration to hand over documents about the decision to keep the Boeing 737 MAX in the air after a deadly Lion Air crash last October.
A week after Lion Air Flight 610 nose-dived into the Java Sea, killing all 189 aboard, the FAA warned airlines that erroneous inputs from an automated flight control system's sensors could lead the jet to automatically pitch its nose down, but the agency allowed the jets to continue flying.
Five months later, the same system was blamed for playing a role when ET302 crashed on March 10, killing all 157 passengers and crew and prompting a worldwide grounding of the 737 MAX that remains in place.
""The decisions to keep those planes in service are key,"" Robert Clifford of Clifford Law Offices, which represents families of the Ethiopian crash victims, said at a status hearing before U.S. Judge Jorge Alonso in Chicago.
Nearly 100 lawsuits have been filed against Boeing by at least a dozen law firms representing families of the Ethiopian Airlines crash victims, who came from 35 different countries, including nine U.S. citizens and 19 Canadians. 
Families of about 60 victims have yet to file lawsuits but plaintiffs' lawyers said they anticipate more to come. Most of the lawsuits do not make a specific dollar claim, though Ribbeck Law Chartered has said its clients are seeking more than $1 billion. 
The lawsuits assert that Boeing defectively designed the automated flight control system. The system is believed to have repeatedly forced the nose lower in both accidents.
Boeing declined to comment on the lawsuit directly but said it is cooperating fully with the investigating authorities. The manufacturer has apologized for the lives lost in both crashes and is upgrading software. But it has stopped short of admitting any fault in how it developed the 737 MAX, or the software.
The FAA said it does not comment on litigation. The agency has defended its decision not to ground the 737 MAX sooner and has said it is following a thorough process for returning the jet to passenger service.
Clifford, who was appointed lead counsel on Tuesday to represent the majority of plaintiffs suing Boeing over the Ethiopian Airlines crash, said he would pursue two tracks in the case: one for clients who wish to settle with Boeing and another for those who want to push for discovery. 
In his role as lead counsel, Clifford will help the different plaintiffs ""speak with one voice,"" said Ricardo Martinez-Cid of Podhurst Orseck, a law firm that is also representing Ethiopian Airlines crash victims.
Plaintiffs' lawyers who represent victims of airline crashes generally work for free and receive a percentage of the settlement or award. 
Amos Mbicha, who lost his sister and her son in the crash of ET302 which occurred soon after it departed Addis Ababa for Nairobi, said some Kenyan families had not sued yet because they had difficulty choosing between the many law firms seeking to represent victims.
""You look at the brochures, it all looks like everyone worked on the same cases,"" he said. ""It’s confusing for people."" 
Dozens of lawsuits have been filed against Boeing by families of Lion Air crash victims, who were almost all from Indonesia. Those cases are already in mediation and are not expected to be consolidated with Ethiopian Airlines.

""While the cases share some common issues there are big differences, most importantly the critical evidence of what Boeing did and did not do between October and March,"" said Justin Green, a lawyer from Kreindler & Kreindler, who was appointed co-chair of the plaintiffs' committee on Tuesday.

9,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 17, 2019 07:56PM ET</span>",Toyota banks on Olympic halo for the humble bus to keep hydrogen dream alive,"By Kevin Buckland
TOKYO (Reuters) - Buses may not be the most glamorous mode of transport but at the 2020 Tokyo Olympic games, they will represent Toyota Motor Corp's (T:7203) best bet for wider acceptance of hydrogen power - technology so far eclipsed by electric vehicles.
Japan's biggest automaker plans to roll out 100 hydrogen fuel cell buses to shuttle visitors between venues, a stepping stone to a big ramp up for the Beijing Winter Olympics in 2022.
There, more than 1,000 buses are planned in partnership with Beiqi  Foton Motor  Co (SS:600166), according to people familiar with the project, which aims to make the most of a push by China to start adopting the zero-emissions technology.
The plans to promote hydrogen with its exclusive Olympic 'mobility' sponsorship deal - one Toyota holds until 2024 - underscore its determination to keep backing the technology. That's despite an increasing number of electric cars on the road and Toyota's own efforts to speed up EV development.
But its reliance on buses for hydrogen publicity also highlights the lack of traction for its fuel cell cars, and the risk that hydrogen-powered transport may never be more than a niche market despite a quarter century of development and Japanese government backing.
Toyota has sold fewer than 10,000 of the Mirai, a fuel cell sedan it touted as a game changer at its launch five years ago. Costing consumers about 5 million yen ($46,200) in Japan after subsidies, it is one of three fuel cell cars available to consumers.  Hyundai Motor  Co (KS:005380) sells the Nexo, while Honda Motor Co Ltd (T:7267) leases out the Clarity.
By contrast, Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) sold 25,000 of its all-electric Model S sedans in its first year and a half.
The disappointing Mirai sales reflect insufficient refueling stations, consumer worries about resale values and concerns over the risk of hydrogen explosions. A hydrogen tank blast in South Korea that killed two in May was followed by another at a Norway hydrogen station in June.
""Hydrogen still has this image of being dangerous - that it might explode - and our aim with the Olympics is to erase this image,"" Masaaki Ito, Toyota's general manager of its Olympic and Paralympic division, told Reuters.
The company will also provide 500 Mirai sedans to ferry officials between venues at the Tokyo Olympics. ""We want to expose the technology to as many people as possible.""
GOVT AMBITIONS UNFULFILLED
Toyota, which is also developing fuel cell delivery trucks and big rigs, has not disclosed how much money it has poured into the technology but it has been emboldened by support from the Japanese government, which sees hydrogen as a key way to reduce its reliance on oil.
Both envision a ""hydrogen society"" where homes, trains, ships, and even lunar rovers can be powered by fuel cells that turn the invisible, odorless gas into electricity.
The city of Tokyo, which will showcase the Olympic village for athletes as a hydrogen society in miniature, is buying most of the buses for its Toei municipal transport service, with 15 already in operation.
Unlike cars, buses have fixed routes, making it easier to plan fuelling stations and give them a shot at being profitable.
Local and national government subsidies cover 80% of the cost, bringing them in line with the 23 million yen ($213,000) price tag for a regular diesel bus, a Toei representative said.
But lofty government goals remain unmet. Three years ago, Japan declared that by 2020 it wanted 40,000 fuel cell vehicles on the road and 160 hydrogen fuelling stations in operation.
Today, just 3,400 fuel cell vehicles have been sold in Japan and it has 109 hydrogen stations.
Though vital for fuel cell cars to catch on, the stations are not easy to build, costing five times as much as a gasoline stand. Due to stringent safety regulations, they also require large plots of land which are in scarce supply.
RELYING ON CHINA
Yet for all the slow progress, some analysts don't fault Toyota's pursuit of hydrogen power, pointing to China's backing of the technology and its vast auto market.
""China is actually moving ahead a lot faster and although they suffer the same issue with lack of refueling infrastructure, China has shown in the past that they can get infrastructure done pretty quickly,"" said Janet Lewis, head of Asian auto research at Macquarie.
For the Beijing games, Toyota will supply powertrain components for the Foton buses. They will be emblazoned with ""Powered by Toyota"" branding during the event, the sources said, declining to be identified as the plans have not been made public.
Toyota said the number of fuel cell buses for the Beijing Olympics has not been decided and that branding would be up to Foton. Foton did not respond to requests for comment.
Toyota has similar deals with Higer Bus Co and China FAW Group Corp.
The project with Higer will likely have a fleet of 20 buses ready for deployment in early 2020 whereas FAW plans to have its first prototype ready by the end of the year, said Audrey Ma, a director at Shanghai ReFire Technology Co, which is doing the system integration.
Outside of China, the only other similar deal Toyota has announced is one to supply fuel cell systems to Portugal's Caetanobus.
Although the technology remains unprofitable, Toyota says costs will fall with scale. It is building new fuel cell stack and hydrogen tank factories so it can lift production of fuel cell vehicles to 30,000 a year.

The panel's chair, Representative Peter DeFazio, also asked John Hamilton, the chief engineer of Boeing’s Commercial Airplanes division, to appear. Both executives have been asked to testify on Oct. 30.
Last week, DeFazio asked Muilenburg to make several employees available for interviews as part of a congressional probe into the design, development and certification of 737 MAX aircraft.

""Boeing has received the Committee’s invitation and is reviewing it now. We will continue to cooperate with Congress and regulatory authorities as we focus on safely returning the MAX to service,"" a Boeing representative said in a statement.

11,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 17, 2019 06:23PM ET</span>",GM stops paying for health insurance for striking union workers; talks continue,"By Bryan Woolston
BOWLING GREEN, Ky. (Reuters) - General Motors Co (N:GM) shifted health insurance costs for its striking workers to the United Auto Workers union as its members walked the picket line for the second day on Tuesday.
The UAW on Monday launched the first company-wide strike at GM in 12 years, saying negotiations toward a new national agreement covering about 48,000 hourly workers had hit an impasse.
This year's talks between the union and GM,  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) and  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCA) (MI:FCHA) (N:FCAU) were expected to be tough, with thorny issues such as healthcare costs, profit-sharing and the use of temporary workers on the table.
The UAW said Tuesday that some progress had been made during talks. As of Tuesday evening, talks were still continuing among some committee-level bargaining groups but no deal was imminent, officials said. The strike has now surpassed the length of the nearly two-day 2007 GM work stoppage.
Workers on picket lines outside GM factories waved signs declaring ""UAW On Strike."" In Bowling Green, Kentucky, they blocked the three entrances to the assembly plant, which normally builds the Chevrolet Corvette.
Salina Alexander, who works in the Kentucky plant's paint shop, said the strike is about GM sharing some of its profits with union-represented employees who helped bail out the carmaker during its bankruptcy. ""We hung in there with them. They can give us something back.""
Meanwhile, GM said coverage for the striking workers' health insurance reverted to the union, which unsuccessfully sought to have the No. 1 U.S. automaker cover those costs through the end of the month. That places another drain on the union's strike fund.
""We understand strikes are difficult and disruptive to families,"" GM spokesman Jim Cain said in an email. ""While on strike, some benefits shift to being funded by the union's strike fund, and in this case hourly employees are eligible for union-paid COBRA so their health care benefits can continue.""
GM has said in the past that it annually spends about $1 billion a year on healthcare coverage for its hourly workers, suggesting the monthly cost per worker is in the range of $1,700 to $2,000. The UAW on its website said its strike fund covers certain benefits such as medical and prescription drugs, but not dental, vision and hearing. (https://uaw.org/strike-faq/)
A UAW spokesman had no immediate comment, but Terry Dittes, vice president in charge of the union's GM department, in a letter to union leaders on Tuesday, said the UAW would review its legal options regarding GM's decision.
During the walkout, UAW members also receive $250 a week from the union's strike fund.
In a statement on Sunday, GM outlined its offer to the union, saying the package included plans for Michigan and Ohio assembly plants currently lacking products, $7 billion in U.S. investment and a signing bonus of $8,000 per worker. GM also said the union would retain ""nationally leading"" health care benefits.
Charlie Highlander, 59, who also works in the Bowling Green plant's paint shop, said the strike was about protecting the rights of younger workers who are paid at a lower wage or are hired as temporary workers. 
""I'm out here mostly for them,"" he said. ""It's about the young people for me.""
The contract talks with GM have been overshadowed by a mushrooming U.S. federal corruption probe of top union officials. The investigation has raised questions about UAW President Gary Jones, who a source said was an unnamed official cited in a federal complaint last week detailing alleged embezzlement by union leaders.
The strike has also become a political issue, and both U.S. President Donald Trump and Democrats who want to unseat him in 2020 have weighed in. Trump and Democrats see the votes of UAW members in the Midwest as critical to victory.
GM's workers last went out on a brief two-day strike in 2007 during contract talks. A more painful strike occurred in Flint, Michigan, in 1998, lasting 54 days and costing the automaker more than $2 billion.

12,By Investing.com,"<span>Sep 17, 2019 06:00PM ET</span>",Day Ahead - Top 3 Things to Watch,"Investing.com - Here’s a look at three things that could rock markets tomorrow.
1. It’s Fed Day and Suddenly a Rate Cut Is in Doubt
The Federal Open Market Committee will announce its decision on interest rates tomorrow and what looked like a foregone conclusion at the start of the month has turned into a dead heat.
There is now just a 53% chance that the Fed will cut rates by a quarter point to a range of 1.75% to 2%, according to Investing.com’s Fed Rate Monitor Tool.
Chances had been well above 90% for most of the time after the Fed’s last cut.
A few things changed in the landscape, such as a slight thaw in trade relations between the U.S. and China, a sharp rebound in Treasury yields, upbeat economic data and a move back to risk assets by investors.
That would usually be enough to for the FOMC to keep rates on hold. But now there’s political pressure on the rate-setting committee and especially Fed Chairman Jerome Powell.
President Donald Trump has called for negative rates from the Fed, who are “boneheads” according to the president, so that the U.S. can refinance its debt obligations (something easier tweeted than done).
The FOMC statement arrives at 2 PM ET (18:00 GMT), and Powell will hold his press conference at 2:30 PM ET.
2. Housing Starts, Permits for August on the Calendar
Ahead of the Fed the market will get some more insight into the state of the U.S. housing market.
The Commerce Department will report numbers on August housing starts and building permits at 8:30 AM ET (12:30 GMT).
Housing starts are predicted to show 4.5% rise to an annual rate of 1.25 million, according to economists’ forecast compiled by Investing.com.
Building permits, an indication of future demand, are seen ticking down slightly to an annual rate of 1.31 million.
Shares of home builders have been strong in 2019, along with companies that support residential housing, including   Home Depot   Inc (NYSE:HD), Lowe’s Companies (NYSE:LOW) and Whirlpool Corporation (NYSE:WHR).
3. Inventories on Tap After Oil Volatility
After the Saudi oil attacks, which led to a more-than-14% jump and 5%-plus tumble in crude prices back to back, we have the U.S. Energy Information Administration’s weekly report.
The last three reports in this series have been spectacular for their crude draws totaling nearly 22 million barrels in all, as well as weekly crude exports at a steady clip of 3 million barrels.
At 10:30 AM ET (14:30 GMT), the EIA will issue its assessment of U.S. oil inventories for the week ended Sept 13.
Analysts are predicting a drawdown of about 800,000 barrels for oil.
Last week, the EIA reported a crude drawdown of 6.9 million barrels, a gasoline stockpile drop of 680,000 and a distillates build of 2.7 million."

The S&P 500 finished up 0.26%. The Dow Jones industrials rose 0.12%, and the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.40%. The Nasdaq 100 index also was modestly higher.
After hours, shares of package shipping giant FedEx (NYSE:FDX) tumbled after reporting disappointing earnings and offering weak guidance. The company complained about intensifying competition and the effects of global trade disputes on its business. Shares were off 9.3% to $157.36. If the loss holds Wednesday, the shares would be down for the year.
Adobe Systems (NASDAQ:ADBE) shares also were lower, despite revenue and earnings beats.
The biggest influence on the markets was the condition of Saudi Arabian oil processing facilities and oil fields after Saturday's drone attack. Saudi Oil Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman said half the production at its key processing facility at Abqaiq was restored in two days. The rest will be restored by the end of September.
Crude oil prices dropped in response. West Texas Intermediate crude fell 5.66% to $59.34 a barrel. Brent crude, the global benchmark, settled down $4.47, about 6.5%, to $64.55. The December contract was down $4.12 to $63.56.
Energy stocks were mostly lower, with the biggest declines seen in Chesapeake Energy (NYSE:CHK), Apache (NYSE:APA) and Halliburton (NYSE:HAL).
The spectacular IPO crash was WeWork parent We Co., which had once been expected to command a market capitalization of some $20 billion on its debut. The IPO was pulled Tuesday until at least October because of investor skepticism about the details.
The Federal Reserve started a two-day meeting on interest rates. A rate decision is due at 2 PM ET (18:00 GMT) Wednesday.

A week ago, the odds were around 90%. 
The causes are the stock market's surge so far in September, decent economic reports and higher bond yields.
The 10-Year Treasury yield was at 1.805%, down from 1.843% on Monday. The Fed was actively involved in money markets Tuesday in a bid to push interest rates lower. The 10-year yield had been as low as 1.462% on Sept. 3 as recession worries mounted.
Airline stocks, including   American Airlines Group   (NASDAQ:AAL), JetBlue Airways (NASDAQ:JBLU) and United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL), moved higher as oil prices fell. Department store stocks, including Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN), Macy’s (NYSE:M) and   Dillards   (NYSE:DDS) were sharply lower.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Federal Aviation Administration chief Steve Dickson has invited about 50 aviation safety regulators from around the world to an informal briefing in Montreal next week on the status of the grounded Boeing 737 MAX, according to an email seen by Reuters.
The FAA has been reviewing proposed software and training changes from  Boeing Co  (N:BA) for its best-selling plane that has been grounded since March in the aftermath of two fatal crashes in five months. Dickson's email said the FAA is working to provide regulators with ""useful information as you make your individual decisions on safely returning your fleets to service.""
The meeting, to be held on Monday, is taking place in connection with the International Civil Aviation Organization World Aviation Forum.
Boeing plans to revise the 737 MAX software to take input from both angle-of-attack sensors in the MCAS anti-stall system linked to the two deadly crashes. It is not clear when Boeing will conduct a key certification test flight, a step needed before the FAA can return the plane to service.
Some government officials do not believe Boeing will conduct that flight until October.
The European Union Aviation Safety Agency said last week it ""intends to conduct its own test flights separate from, but in full coordination with, the FAA. The test flights are not scheduled yet, the date will depend on the development schedule of Boeing.""
Separately, a joint governmental review of the Boeing 737 MAX that includes aviation regulators from around the world is expected to be released in the coming weeks. The review is expected to find places where regulations need to be harmonized internationally and where communications could be improved at the FAA and among international regulators, a person briefed on the matter said Tuesday.

Major U.S. airlines have canceled flights into December as a result of the MAX grounding, including  American Airlines Group  Inc (O:AAL) and United Airlines (O:UAL), while Southwest Airlines Co (N:LUV) has canceled flights into early January.

18,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 17, 2019 04:36PM ET</span>",Trump to bar California from setting vehicle emission rules: sources,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration will announce as early as Wednesday it is revoking California’s authority to set its own greenhouse gas and vehicle fuel efficiency standards and barring all states from setting such rules, two auto industry officials said on Tuesday.
The move is sure to spark legal challenges over issues including states' rights and climate change that administration officials say could ultimately be decided by the U.S. Supreme Court.
Trump met with senior officials last Thursday and agreed to greenlight the plan to bar California from setting tailpipe emission standards or requiring zero emission vehicles, Reuters reported last week. The White House declined to comment.
The administration plans to issue separate rules rolling back Obama-era fuel economy requirements in the coming weeks. A formal announcement is tentatively set for Wednesday at the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) headquarters and automakers and dealers have been invited to attend, industry officials said.
Government officials said the timing is still in flux and could be announced later in the week.
EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler, speaking to a group of auto dealers, said Tuesday that ""in the very near future, the Trump administration will begin taking the steps necessary to establish one set of national fuel-economy standards.""
Under Trump, federal regulators have backed freezing emissions requirements for new cars and trucks at 2020 levels through 2026. Administration officials say its final regulation will include a modest boost in annual efficiency requirements but far less than what the Obama administration set in 2012.
The Obama-era rules called for a fleetwide fuel efficiency average of 46.7 miles per gallon by 2025, with average annual increases of about 5%, compared with 37 mpg by 2026 under the Trump administration’s preferred option to freeze requirements.
Wheeler said the EPA would take action ""very soon"" with the U.S. Transportation Department ""to bring clarity to the proper – and improper – scope and use of the Clean Air Act preemption waiver."" 
Reuters has previously reported the administration plans to revoke the waiver California received in 2013 to set its own vehicle emissions standards that are followed by more than a dozen other states.
California wants 15.4% of vehicle sales by 2025 to be EVs or other zero emission vehicles and 10 other states have adopted those requirements.
California has vowed to challenge the Trump administration effort, arguing that the United States has an obligation to protect the environment for future generations. ""We'll see you in court if you stand in our way,"" California Attorney General Xavier Becerra said.
Some senior administration officials believe provoking a court battle with California gives them a historic chance to displace the state from vehicle emissions oversight and could give the Supreme Court the chance to revisit a landmark 5-4 2007 decision that found the EPA has the legal authority to regulate carbon dioxide emissions from vehicles.
Wheeler on Tuesday said California's ability to address smog and other forms of air pollution caused by motor vehicles would not be affected.
""One national standard will provide much-needed regulatory certainty to automakers, dealers, and consumers,"" he said. 
To meet the Obama-era rules, automakers might have been forced to lower the price of electric vehicles and ""raise the price of other, more popular vehicles, such as SUVs and trucks,"" Wheeler added.
""In other words, American families are paying more for SUVs and trucks so automakers can sell EVs at a cheaper price.""
Dan Becker, director of the Safe Climate Campaign, said the attack on California and other states ""threatens to make America polluted again. It rejects cleaner, less-polluting vehicles in favor of pollution-spewing Trump-mobiles for urban cowboys hauling lattes home from Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX).""
The Trump administration is battling California on several auto industry fronts.
In August, the Justice Department sent letters to four major automakers asking about their voluntary agreement with California to adopt compromise vehicle emissions requirements, antitrust chief Makan Delrahim confirmed Tuesday.
""I'm not out there to try to increase pollution into the air,"" Delrahim said at a Senate hearing.
 Ford Motor Co  (N:F), Honda Motor Co (T:7267), BMW AG (DE:BMWG), and Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p) said in July they had reached a deal to adopt standards that were lower than Obama-era rules but higher than the Trump administration’s 2018 proposal.

The automakers were defying the Trump administration’s effort to strip California of the right to fight climate change by setting its own standards.

20,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 17, 2019 04:23PM ET</span>","U.S. worker, food-safety advocates sound alarm over new hog slaughter rules","By Tom Polansek
CHICAGO (Reuters) - U.S. food safety and the health of plant workers will be at risk from new federal rules that allow meat companies to slaughter hogs as fast as they want and shift the role of government inspectors, food and environmental advocates said on Tuesday. 
The warnings about the U.S. Department of Agriculture's first update of inspection procedures at hog slaughterhouses in more than 50 years come after several high-profile recalls in the meat sector. 
The USDA earlier on Tuesday published a final version of rules that will eliminate limits on how fast companies such as  Tyson Foods  (N:TSN), Hormel Foods (N:HRL) and WH Group's (HK:0288) Smithfield Foods can slaughter pigs - a change long sought by meatpackers. 
The companies can instead determine their own slaughter speeds based on their ability to prevent fecal contamination and minimize bacteria, according to the rules. 
Packers can also have employees, rather than USDA workers, remove meat with certain defects from the slaughtering process. Government inspectors will continue to check all live animals before they are killed as well as meat products after slaughter.
The changes could contribute to food contamination, said Wenonah Hauter, executive director of advocacy group Food & Water Watch.
""The implementation of the rule will result in the fox guarding the henhouse,"" Hauter said.
Tyson Foods, the biggest U.S. meat producer, slowed chicken processing to protect food safety this year after it recalled millions of pounds of poultry products over concerns they contained extraneous materials like rubber and metal. 
Tyson, Hormel and Smithfield did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the USDA's new rules. The North American Meat Institute, which represents the packers, said companies will continue to produce safe pork. 
Slower processing leads to higher costs for companies and limits profits, but advocates say extra caution protects workers. 
""Increasing pork plant line speeds is a reckless corporate giveaway that would put thousands of workers in harm's way as they are forced to meet impossible demands,"" said Marc Perrone, president of the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union, which represents slaughterhouse employees.
The USDA ran a pilot program for the new rules that was announced in 1997. Participating slaughterhouses do not operate significantly faster than the current maximum speed of 1,106 pigs per hour, according to the agency. 
The pilot program showed the rules are unlikely to cause a higher prevalence of Salmonella on pork and may reduce the prevalence of Salmonella, the USDA said. Under the new rules, the agency will require hog slaughterhouses to establish procedures to prevent meat from being contaminated by certain pathogens and fecal material.

""This regulatory change allows us to ensure food safety while eliminating outdated rules and allowing for companies to innovate,"" USDA Secretary Sonny Perdue said.

22,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 17, 2019 03:41PM ET</span>","Bank stocks slip as borrowing costs rise, 10-year yields fall","By Sinéad Carew
(Reuters) - Bank stocks slipped on Tuesday for a second consecutive day, with a roughly three-week rally losing steam, as overnight borrowing costs soared. The Russell 2000 Value index also lost ground and 10-Year Treasury yields fell.
The S&P 500 bank sector index was last down 0.8%, after falling as low as 1.6% earlier in the session. It had closed down 0.3% on Monday.
Repo rates, the cost for banks and Wall Street dealers to borrow dollars, were elevated, exposing cracks in U.S. money markets in advance of a Federal Reserve monetary policy meeting where traders widely expect an interest rate cut.
""People are starting to get worried about the moves in repo rates,"" said R.J. Grant, head of trading at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods in New York, noting that U.S. stocks had a major sell-off in December amid repo rate stress.
""If the Fed does cut rates tomorrow, 25 basis points, and signals that they still see the economy on strong footing, the rally in banks could continue. The overall market might not like that but the banks might outperform,"" said Grant. ""The market wants the Fed to be very accommodative.""
But bank stocks already rose 13% between Aug. 23 and Sept. 13, while the Russell 2000 Value index rose 10.6% and the 10-year Treasury yields (US10YT=RR) climbed from 1.459% on Sept. 4 to end the Sept. 13 session at 1.899%.
Since the early September bank rally was not underpinned by big changes in bank fundamentals, Rick Meckler, partner at Cherry Lane Investments, a family investment office in New Vernon, New Jersey, said it was likely driven by quantitative traders rather than long-term investors.
""When its trading-related, it's not nearly as sustainable because positions are often unwound or they run out of steam when the trade's over,"" said Meckler.
The U.S. 10-year Treasury yield was last at 1.7996%, compared with 1.843% the day before.
The 10-year yield had fallen as low as 1.429% during the Sept. 3 trading day as investors worried about escalating U.S.-China trade tensions and the potential impact on already slowing global economic growth. Then the yield rebounded sharply in less than two weeks as fear of trade war escalation turned to hopes for progress in the next round of U.S.-China talks.
""Investors had probably gone too far into the fear trade,"" and then the rebound was due to ""a pause in trade tensions and maybe over-optimism"" said Burns McKinney, portfolio manager with Allianz (DE:ALVG) Global Investors in Dallas.
One factor that could be capping U.S. bank stock gains is the relative attractiveness of U.S. Treasuries compared with some overseas bonds, which are trading at negative rates.
""As long as ... you can get positive absolute yields in the United States and negative yields overseas, you're going to see an influx of demand for U.S. assets,"" said McKinney. ""That's going to act as a headwind for the banks for the longer term, a cap to keep them from going too much higher too quickly.""
But countering that has been the U.S. banks' capacity to return money to shareholders by buying back their own shares and paying hefty dividends, according to Meckler.
""For some investors, banks represent a kind of call option on the market. They have the kind of dividend yields and buybacks that people feel provide a floor for the stocks,"" he said."

The U.S. healthcare industry has seen a string of multi-billion dollar deals and consolidation is expected to remain a major theme for the rest of the year.
Bristol-Myers Squibb's (N:BMY) $74 billion buyout of  Celgene Corp  (O:CELG) and AbbVie Inc's (N:ABBV) $63 billion bid for troubled smaller rival Allergan Plc (N:AGN) were among the largest deals announced this year.
The deals proposed by AbbVie and Bristol-Myers raise significant antitrust issues, the senators wrote, calling on the FTC to ""take appropriate action"" to protect consumers from mergers that may threaten competition, raise drug prices or reduce patient access to essential medications.
They also raised concerns that the deals may reduce innovation in drug development and give the merged companies increased negotiating leverage to secure positions on drug formularies and greater ability to condition buyers' access to their multi-billion dollar drugs.
""This industry consolidation is occurring against a backdrop of ever rising prescription drug spending... It is more important than ever that the FTC take appropriate action to protect consumers,"" Klobuchar wrote in the letter signed by senators Bernie Sanders, Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren and Cory Booker among others."

""While JUUL products are not currently available on e-commerce Web sites in China, we look forward to continued dialogue with stakeholders so that we can make our products available again,"" the company spokesperson said, without disclosing any reason for the halt of sales.
Juul, in which tobacco giant Altria group (N:MO) owns a 35% stake, is facing a regulatory crackdown and increased government scrutiny in the domestic market.
The company is aggressively expanding in international markets including China where it has set up virtual stores on Tmall, an  Alibaba  Group (N:BABA) site, and on JD.com (O:JD), another major online retailer.
A search by Reuters showed that while it is still possible to find the listing for Juul's official store on Tmall, when one clicks on the link it says ""fails to load store"".
The company's store is no longer searchable on JD.com.
JD.com and Alibaba were not immediately reachable for comment outside business hours."

(Reuters) - Oxycontin maker Purdue Pharma LP on Tuesday told a bankruptcy judge it hopes to broaden support for a proposed settlement of 2,600 lawsuits alleging it fueled the U.S. opioid crisis, but opponents of the deal highlighted looming legal battles.
A lawyer representing the company told U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Robert Drain in White Plains, New York that the case was an opportunity to end a ""chaotic maelstrom"" of litigation.
Purdue filed for bankruptcy on Sunday after reaching an outline of a deal with states and local governments that have accused the company of deceptively marketing opioids by overstating benefits and downplaying risks.
It has been accused of contributing to a public health crisis that has led to nearly 400,000 overdose deaths between 1999 and 2017, according to the latest U.S. data. 
The settlement, which Purdue estimates is worth more than $10 billion, would require the Sackler family to cede ownership of Purdue to a trust controlled by the plaintiffs that are suing it. In addition to turning over Purdue, the Sacklers would sell their non-U.S. pharmaceutical businesses and also contribute at least $3 billion of their own money.
“Purdue is not shielding itself from these claimants. It is giving itself to these claimants without them even having to prevail in the litigation,” Marshall Huebner, a Davis, Polk & Wardwell lawyer representing Purdue, told the court.
Numerous states oppose the plan, including New York. A lawyer for the state told Drain that the proposed deal did not address how settlement funds will be allocated among governments. He also said settling states did not appear as interested in conducting thorough investigations of Purdue.
""We have different views and different experiences in terms of our aggressive pursuit of some issues, including payments to the Sacklers,"" said David Nachman, who leads the New York's opioid litigation.
On Friday, New York Attorney General Letitia James said she uncovered roughly $1 billion in wire transfers ""between the Sacklers, entities they control and different financial institutions, including those that have funneled funds into Swiss bank accounts.""
A spokesman for former Purdue board member Mortimer D.A. Sackler said in a statement that the transfers were legal and appropriate, and accused James of using the transfers to try to undermine the settlement.
Huebner acknowledged that Purdue faces several battles, including over whether a bankruptcy filing pauses government investigations and lawsuits.
“I remain hopeful that parties may be more willing to settle as they learn more about facts and numbers they didn’t previously know,” said Huebner during the three-hour hearing.
Purdue is the second drug company to seek bankruptcy over the opioid crisis. Insys Therapeutics Inc filed for bankruptcy in June, also citing opioid litigation. 

The Chandler, Arizona-based drugmaker, which recently agreed to sell its flagship fentanyl spray Subsys, on Tuesday unveiled a liquidation plan to repay its creditors, including states and localities that have sued. The plan did not spell out how much state and local governments would recover, but said they would not be paid in full.

26,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 17, 2019 03:18PM ET</span>","From underpants to oat drink makers, Citigroup courts startups for growth","By Imani Moise
(Reuters) - At an event hosted by  Citigroup  Inc (N:C) this month, its dealmakers sat executives from major consumer-product companies alongside rivals trying to disrupt their businesses. 
The idea, bankers said, was to hatch partnerships between old companies that are replete with cash and searching for growth, and fledgling companies that are gobbling up market share and need working capital. 
One of the blue-chip titans that benefited from Citi's matchmaking was  Kimberly Clark  Corp (N:KMB). Known for selling tissues and diapers, the Irving, Texas-based company made an investment in a direct-to-consumer brand on Tuesday, inking a $25 million deal with period-proof-panty startup Thinx, the startup said. 
Such tie-ups help Citigroup bankers improve relationships with large-cap clients while also building connections with privately held companies that may one day go public, said Elinor Hoover, Citigroup’s co-head of consumer investment banking. 
""We do need to have our finger closely on the pulse not only because it’s important to our equity franchise, but it also is important to our mainstream bigger cap clients and our overall advisory business,"" Hoover said in an interview.
Hoover began organizing Citigroup’s Consumer Disruptive Growth Conference three years ago. At the time, her team did not pay much attention to emerging companies that were quickly grabbing a greater portion of revenue, as well as deal volumes. 
The Sept. 11 conference attracted nearly 400 attendees, Hoover said. Among them were household names like Kimberly Clark,  Hershey Co  (N:HSY) and J.C. Penney Company Inc (N:JCP), and startups like beauty-products site Glossier, Swedish oat-drink maker Oatly and e-commerce merchant Brandless. There were also private-equity investors and high-net-worth clients from Citi’s private bank. 
Citigroup plans to expand this strategy to other sectors, including automotive, media and healthcare, said Paul Abrahimzadeh, head of equity capital markets syndicate for the Americas. The consumer business was a natural place to start, because incumbents there have been disrupted more than in other industries. 
The average time for companies to remain in the S&P 500 was 24 years in 2016, down from 33 years in 1994, according to market-research provider Innosight. The firm predicts half of the companies now in the S&P 500 will be replaced over the next decade, with the consumer-products industry facing the most upheaval. 
Citigroup is not the only bank responding to the trend.
SWARMING SILICON VALLEY 
Bank of America Corp (N:BAC) has expanded its team of dealmakers who cater to private companies, Chief Operating Officer Tom Montag said at a conference last week. Other Wall Street banks including  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS) and  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS) have swarmed Silicon Valley, offering advice and capital to hot startups in hopes of winning IPOs, advising on acquisitions or performing capital raises. 
Part of Citigroup’s strategy has been reorganizing staff to increase collaboration and win more business. 
Roughly a year ago, its investment bank created the technology and strategy solutions team, which tries to get non-technology companies to think about digital disruption. Sean Rogers, who runs the team, spends his time pitching manufacturers, retailers and other conventional companies on deals and partnerships with startups. 
Citigroup also integrated teams that focus on raising capital in public and private markets, because companies sometimes need to consider both options, Abrahimzadeh said. 
Its dealmakers are also collaborating more closely with commercial bankers and wealth managers to build relationships with up-and-coming companies and put them on larger clients' radars, executives said. 
Banks have little choice but to cater to companies in their near-infancy because of interest from investors and corporations, said Leon Kalvaria, chairman of Citi's institutional clients group. 

""Big companies are all interested in it on a senior management and board level,"" he said. “

It will force non-European Union players to notify Rome of any takeover intentions or plans to acquire stakes in such assets.
The powers would allow the government to oppose any move by a non-EU player to acquire an interest in the Milan bourse which is controlled by the  London Stock Exchange  (L:LSE).
Earlier this month the Hong Kong bourse made an unsolicited takeover bid on the LSE which was rebuffed by the UK group.

29,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 17, 2019 02:26PM ET</span>",Higher fuel prices may steal holiday cheer from U.S. retailers,"By Noel Randewich and Lisa Baertlein
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - U.S. retailers already reeling from the U.S.-China trade war and an uncertain economic picture now have something else to fret about this holiday season - higher fuel prices.
A surge in energy prices after weekend attacks on Saudi Arabia's oil facilities has raised the specter of more expensive gasoline for U.S. consumers and steeper shipping costs for retailers, just as the crucial holiday shopping period approaches.
While oil prices partly recovered on Tuesday after a Saudi official told Reuters that production could recover within weeks, the possibility of an escalating Middle East crisis and prolonged higher energy prices has emerged just as Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) steps up competition with free one-day shipping.
Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc , which has its own trucking fleet with more than 8,000 U.S. drivers, and other retailers like  Target  Corp (NYSE:TGT) have been expanding their own online shopping and free-shipping offers to compete better against Amazon. All of these companies could face hits to their bottom lines if energy prices remain elevated.
At the same time, potentially higher gasoline prices could keep some consumers at home during the crucial holiday shopping period between Thanksgiving and Christmas, in some cases doing more of their shopping online.
The national average price of regular gasoline is currently $2.59 per gallon, down from $2.85 a year ago, according to the AAA, which warned on Monday that motorists should expect volatility in the coming weeks.
If gasoline prices rise substantially, ""Consumers are far and away going to be attracted to more point-and-click shopping, but the cost of executing on its delivery promise will certainly dampen Amazon's profits,"" said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Cresset Wealth Advisors, which has shares of Amazon and Walmart.
The S&P 500 retailing index is down 1.2% since the weekend, compared to the S&P 500's 0.25% loss, reacting to increased uncertainty faced by retailers already wrestling with fallout from the U.S.-China trade war.
Store chains have been working for months on plans to ease the pain from new tariffs on products including apparel and electronics: adjusting their supply chains, pushing suppliers to bear part of the higher costs, and building inventory before tariffs kick in. Less flexible retailers will be forced to pass higher costs from the tariffs to consumers, who for years have been conditioned to expect deep holiday season discounts.
""As these price hikes go into effect, people are going to rethink their purchases, especially of elastic goods like apparel, home furnishings and consumer electronics,"" warned CFRA Research analyst Camilla Yanushevsky.
In another potential hiccup for retailers, the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday falls on Nov. 28 this year, leaving 26 days between the traditional start of the holiday shopping season and Dec. 24, which is Christmas Eve. Last year, Thanksgiving fell on Nov. 22, which meant a 32-day shopping season.
While the shift to online shopping and near permanent promotions have made the length of the holiday shopping period less important to overall retail spending, this year's shorter season could harm individual chains that are already struggling.
""Even if it's only a few days, you have less time to get it right. You've got less opportunity to make sure your strategy is working, so you've got to be even more nimble as a retailer in making sure you're selling through your product and that you've got the right promotions at the right time,"" said Neil Saunders, managing director of research firm GlobalData Retail.
While a report from the Commerce Department on Friday showed retail sales were solid in August, many economists worry the year-long trade war between the United States and China could cause a recession. Extended high oil prices would increase uncertainty for companies across the global economy.
When Fedex Corp reports its quarterly results late on Tuesday, investors will look for hints about how it and rival  United Parcel  Service Inc (N:UPS) might be affected by higher fuel prices.
Amazon has built a delivery service that now includes over 45 aircraft, 10,000 trailers and outsourced drivers. As it ramps up its one-day delivery service, free for its Prime members, Amazon this month announced it was buying over 20,000 Mercedes-Benz vans.
""Amazon is the biggest loser from higher oil prices because they deliver free,"" said Bill Smead, chief executive officer of Smead Capital Management."

Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) Merrill Lynch's latest monthly survey of global managers, which was carried out between Sept. 6 and 12., showed only 7% of investors expect value stocks to outperform growth over the next 12 months.
That is up from the decade low in the last survey, but it undermines speculation that the rapid recent rally in value stocks, which are generally defined as firms whose fundamental worth is not reflected in their current share price such as banks and autos, is the start of a prolonged rotation back into sectors that have underperformed in recent years.
Over the past week, the MSCI world value index has vastly outperformed the growth index. Companies that boast a faster pace of growth, such as like the big U.S. tech names have been favored during the past decade of central bank largesse.
Also, 47% percent of investors surveyed saw oil prices fairly valued around $55 per barrel before the weekend attack on a Saudi Arabia crude oil facility with investors holding the biggest underweight on the resource sector in more than three years.

(Reuters) - Buyout firm Clayton, Dubilier & Rice LLC is in talks to partner with U.S. paint maker PPG Industries Inc (NYSE:PPG) to make an acquisition offer for Axalta Coating Systems Inc, the U.S. coatings company whose largest shareholder is Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) Inc, people familiar with the matter said on Monday. 
The bid would come three months after Axalta said it would explore a sale. It would allow PPG to overcome potential antitrust hurdles it would face were it to buy the entirety of Axalta, and only take on businesses it deems complementary.
CD&R and PPG are discussing forming a consortium to bid for Axalta with other investors that include Singaporean sovereign wealth fund GIC and U.S. asset manager BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK), one of the sources said. 
Other private equity firms are also interested in Axalta, which has a market capitalization of $7.3 billion and long-term debt of close to $4 billion, three sources said. Some of them have also been looking for partners. Buyout firm Platinum Equity LLC, for example, has been in talks about partnering with Koch Industries Inc on a bid for Axalta, one of the sources said, cautioning that it is possible such a bid does not materialize. 
The auction process for Axalta is ongoing and there is no certainty any deal will be reached, the sources said, asking not to be identified because the matter is confidential.
Axalta, PPG, CD&R and Platinum Equity declined to comment. GIC, BlackRock and Koch Industries did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Axalta's coatings are used in the refinishing of cars, buildings and pipelines. Its corporate peers include Sherwin-Williams Co (NYSE:SHW), Akzo Nobel NV, BASF SE (DE:BASFN) and RPM International Inc.
Axalta rebuffed acquisition approaches in 2017 from Akzo Nobel and Nippon Paint Holdings Co Ltd. PPG is currently on an acquisition spree, snapping up smaller coatings companies.
Axalta also got new management in December, following an investigation of previous Chief Executive Officer Terrence Hahn’s conduct by external counsel that Axalta characterized as ""inconsistent with the company's policies."" Axalta never disclosed the investigation’s findings. Hahn was replaced with the company's chief financial officer, Robert Bryant.
Berkshire Hathaway had a 10.4% stake in Axalta as of the end of June. An activist hedge fund, Jana Partners LLC, is also an Axalta shareholder, with a 2.5% stake as of the end of June, according to regulatory filings.

36,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 17, 2019 01:22PM ET</span>","Walmart likely discriminated against female workers, U.S. agency says","By Daniel Wiessner
(Reuters) - Walmart Inc (N:WMT) likely discriminated against 178 female workers by paying them less, denying them promotions or both, because of their gender, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission said in memos seen by Reuters.
The agency urged Walmart and the women who filed complaints to come to a ""just resolution,"" which could include a settlement and changes to Walmart's employment practices, after finding ""reasonable cause"" to believe there was gender discrimination. The memos were issued in July and viewed by Reuters on Tuesday after they were first reported by the Wall Street Journal.
Bentonville, Arkansas-based Walmart is the world's largest retailer and the largest private employer in the U.S. with a workforce of 1.5 million. 
Walmart told the EEOC it was willing to engage in a ""conciliatory process,"" though in most cases the agency's reasonable cause findings were ""vague and non-specific,"" said Randy Hargrove, a Walmart spokesman.
The cases involved allegations that were more than 15 years old, he said, and were ""not representative of the positive experiences millions of women have had working at Walmart.""
Joseph Sellers, a lawyer for the women, said there were at least 1,600 similar complaints pending at the EEOC, accusing Walmart of discriminating against women in pay and promotions between 1999 and 2011. About 150 lawsuits against Walmart, covering the same time period, were pending in federal courts across the country, he said.
In 2011, Walmart convinced the U.S. Supreme Court not to let about 1.5 million female workers complaining about pay and promotions sue in a class action, with a majority of justices concluding the women had too little in common to sue as a group.
Sellers, who represented Walmart workers in that case, said the memos issued in July involve women who worked at Walmart stores in over 30 states. That suggests a broad pattern of pay discrimination rather than isolated instances that could be attributed to local managers, Sellers said. 
The EEOC did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
If Walmart cannot reach a settlement with the women, the EEOC could file a lawsuit against the company or authorize the women to bring their own. 

Sellers declined to comment on the status of settlement negotiations.

(Reuters) - European stocks closed marginally lower on Tuesday as energy shares gave up a chunk of Monday's big gains and banks lost steam ahead of a likely interest rate cut from the U.S. Federal Reserve.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index (STOXX) ended about 0.1% lower as investors sought refuge in defensive sectors such as consumer staples and healthcare after the weekend's attacks on Saudi Arabian oil facilities heightened geopolitical tensions.
Oil & gas sector (SXEP) dropped 0.8% after Reuters reported that Saudi Arabia's oil output will be fully restored quicker than expected, taking two or three weeks not months as initial indications suggested, according to sources.
The index notched its biggest percentage gain since January on Monday after the Saudi attack disrupted more than 5% of global oil supply.
Worries of an escalation in Middle East conflicts and the impact of a spike in oil prices on global growth cast a pall over investor sentiment.
""We continue to think that US-China trade tensions and the outlook for Fed policy remain more important drivers of oil prices,"" Capital Economics analysts wrote in a note.
""Nonetheless, we would not rule out entirely the possibility of an escalation in tensions, leading to an outright conflict in the Middle East.""
While the Houthi group, which is fighting a Saudi-led coalition in Yemen, claimed responsibility for the attack, U.S. President Donald Trump blamed Iran. That accusation prompted Iran's supreme leader on Tuesday to rule out talks with Washington.
Investors were also on the fence ahead of the Fed's policy meeting, which concludes on Wednesday. The central bank is expected to cut interest rates for the second time this year to prop up slowing economic growth.
The European Central Bank last week cut rates deeper into negative territory and relaunched bond purchases with no scheduled end-date.
Banks (SX7P) slumped the most among the main European subsectors with a 2% drop and Italian banks (FTIT8300) also fell as much.
The healthcare (SXDP), utilities (SX6P), real estate (SX86P) and food and beverage (SX3P) indexes - commonly considered the defensive sectors - posted some of the biggest gains after taking a hit in recent weeks amid a turn to growth stocks.
The Swiss stock index (SSMI), which includes many dividend-paying companies, gained about 0.5%.
Frankfurt-listed shares (GDAXI) ended flat as data from the ZEW institute showed the mood among German investors improved more than expected in September, although warned that the outlook remained negative due to trade disputes and Brexit uncertainty.
Shares in Zalando (DE:ZALG) slumped about 10% after a share placement by top investor Kinnevik in the e-commerce retailer. The broader retail index (SXRP) fell 0.6%.
Swedish garden equipment maker Husqvarna (ST:HUSQb) fell 4.3% after it stuck to an operating margin target starting from 2020 as it unveiled new financial goals.
British clothing retailer French Connection (L:FCCN) slid 13% after the company said it expects the sale process to be concluded by the end of the year, delaying it for the second time."

43,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 17, 2019 10:07AM ET</span>","After Feds Seized His Golf Clubs, UAW’s Embattled Boss Lays Low","(Bloomberg) -- In a closed-door meeting at a Detroit casino two years ago, retiring United Auto Workers President Dennis Williams (NYSE:WMB) revealed his successor would be Gary Jones, an accountant then running the union’s western region. The resounding reaction among the union brass in the room was: Gary who?
The UAW’s former chief bean counter didn’t strike anyone as a firebrand in the image of the union’s legendary leader Walter Reuther. But the union was the target of a widening federal corruption probe, and the buttoned-down CPA was seen as the antidote to the UAW’s growing image problem.
Now Jones, 62, appears to be in the crosshairs of the investigation, just as the UAW is sending 46,000 General Motors Co (NYSE:GM). workers to the picket lines in the first nationwide strike against the automaker in 12 years. The mild-mannered finance man was nowhere to be seen when the union announced the strike on Sept. 15 in Detroit. The already low-profile Jones has been incognito since he was implicated -- but not indicted -- in a federal charging document last week that accompanied the arrest of UAW regional director Vance Pearson on conspiracy, money laundering, wire fraud and other charges.
‘Lavish Lifestyle’
Jones, who vowed as president to win back the trust of the rank-and-file with a clean-slate agenda, instead stands accused of using union members’ dues to finance a “lavish lifestyle” that included long stays in luxury lodgings, golf outings and steak dinners with champagne and cigars, according to the government. In a raid of his suburban Detroit home, federal investigators seized golf clubs and $30,000 in cash.
“If you ask anybody in my plant, ‘What do you think of UAW President Gary Jones?’ they’d start laughing and they’d say, ‘He’s a thief, he’s a criminal, he’s a crook,’” said Brian Pannebecker, a forklift driver at Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co.’s axle plant in Sterling Heights, Michigan. “They don’t know him here in Detroit, other than to know that he’s held a lot of lavish conferences out in Palm Springs.”
The UAW didn’t respond to a request for an interview with Jones. Brian Rothenberg, a spokesman for the union, said last week the allegations against Pearson are “very concerning” but added the UAW believes the government “has misconstrued any number of facts.”
Jones became the union’s 12th president in June 2018. After the surprise selection by Williams, he was formally elected during a raucous ceremony at the union’s constitutional convention.
As he stepped up to the podium for his acceptance speech, the theme from “Rocky” blared from loudspeakers while delegates gave him a standing ovation, replete with horns and noise makers.
“I am here to fight for you,” the bespectacled Jones roared, thrusting a fist aloft. “Knowing our core values, knowing who we are and knowing what the UAW is about could not be more important than it is today.”
‘Bad Apples’
Following the fiery speech, Jones took questions from reporters for what may be the only instance in his presidency. He wasted little time suggesting the media was to blame for the black eye the UAW was getting from the corruption scandal, which he insisted involved only a few “bad apples.”
“Specific individuals -- not institutions like the UAW -- are responsible for the betrayals of trust identified by the government,” Jones said, adding that the union had done its own investigation of the misdeeds.
Asked if the union would release the results of its internal probe, Jones replied: “I’ve got to talk to our attorneys.” The union has yet to reveal its findings.
In subsequent public appearances -- at the union’s bargaining convention, ceremonial opening handshakes, Detroit’s Labor Day parade -- Jones declined to engage with the media. When a Bloomberg News reporter attempted to question him at the convention in March, she was blocked by his security.
Humble Beginnings
There is little in Jones’s background that would have prepared him for such scrutiny.
He hired into Ford’s now-shuttered glass factory in Broken Arrow, Oklahoma, 44 years ago. While working and raising two daughters along with his wife, Cindy, Jones earned a bachelor’s degree at the University of Tulsa and became a CPA.
In 1990, then-UAW President Owen Bieber tapped Jones to join the union’s international staff in the accounting department. A year later, he became chief accountant and would climb the ranks until he was elected in 2012 to lead Region 5, which oversees locals spanning states including Missouri, Texas and California.
Since arriving in Detroit a year ago, Jones has worked to transform his taciturn nature into the mold of the fist-pounding labor boss.
“We invested in you, now it’s your turn to invest in us,” Jones told GM Chief Executive Officer Mary Barra as he sat across the table from her during one of the opening handshake events in July. “We are the voice of the American worker, the defenders of the middle class.”
But as the UAW’s scandal spreads, Jones is losing his voice of authority.
“They were already in a situation where trust was damaged with the membership,” Kristin Dziczek, vice president of the industry and labor economics group at the Center for Automotive Research, said after Jones was implicated. “This just makes it worse.”"

HONG KONG (Reuters) -  Anheuser-Busch InBev  NV (BR:ABI) will brave jittery Hong Kong markets in a second attempt to spin off its Asian business on Wednesday, aiming to raise up to $6.6 billion in what could be the world's second largest IPO this year.
The brewing giant, which in July tried to raise up to $9.8 billion through an initial public offering (IPO) of Budweiser Brewing Company APAC Ltd, said on Tuesday it would offer 1.3 billion shares at between HK$27 and HK$30 ($3.45-$3.83) apiece.
The flotation will be a test of investor appetite following anti-government protests that have roiled Hong Kong for nearly four months and have weighed on the stock market.
Markets more generally are also on edge amid a trade dispute between the United States and China and slowing global growth, with the owner of U.S. office-sharing startup WeWork postponing its U.S. IPO on Monday. 
If completed, Budweiser APAC's IPO would provide a boost for Hong Kong after China's  Alibaba  Group Holding Ltd (N:BABA) last month delayed a listing worth up to $15 billion amid the unrest in the former British colony.
""You could say that the conditions are more challenging, but when we listen to potential investors we believe that there is solid excitement about this business and its IPO,"" said Jan Craps, CEO of Budweiser APAC.
The new Budweiser APAC offering includes a rare ""upsize"" option that will enable the company to sell up to 36.8% more shares. Assuming it exercises the option in full at the top end of the price range, the sale could raise up to $6.6 billion before any regular overallotment option is included.
Belgium-based AB InBev would raise up to $4.8 billion without the upsize option. The flotation would hand between 9.5% and 15% of Budweiser APAC to public shareholders.
Even at the low end of the price range, the IPO would be the second biggest globally this year, trailing the $8.1 billion flotation of  Uber Technologies Inc  (N:UBER) in May, data from Refinitiv shows.
So far this year, companies have raised $10.8 billion in IPOs in Hong Kong - well short of the $41 billion raised in New York, according to Refinitiv data. 
Proceeds will help AB InBev, the world's largest brewer, reduce debts of more than $100 billion, accumulated following the purchase of rival SABMiller (LON:SAB) in late 2016.
However, the beer maker also has another goal - creating an Asian champion to spur consolidation. Analysts see the brewing assets of privately held San Miguel of the Philippines (PS:SMC) or of ThaiBev (SI:TBEV) as possible partners or targets.
QUICK AUSTRALIA SALE
AB InBev's revived deal excludes the brewer's Australian operations, which it agreed to sell to Japan's Asahi Group (T:2502) for $11 billion shortly after the IPO was shelved.
Without Australia, a large but mature market, AB InBev's Asia-Pacific operations would be more focused on faster growth markets such as China, India and Vietnam, which could make it easier to achieve a higher valuation, sources have said.
AB InBev shares have risen some 12% since it shelved the previous IPO attempt. The company blamed that decision on market conditions, among other factors. But sources involved in the deal said investors were unwilling to accept AB InBev's valuation for Budweiser APAC. 
The new IPO price range for the business, whose portfolio of more than 50 beer brands includes Stella Artois and Corona, equates to a market capitalization of $45.6 billion-$50.7 billion, the company said in a statement on Tuesday.
Analysts at Bernstein Securities said this represented a 6%-15% discount to its enterprise value on a 12-month forward basis of $52 billion. 
AB InBev has said it will cut its net debt to core profit (EBITDA) ratio to below four times by the end of 2020 from 4.6 at the end of June, without the impact of the Australian sale or the Asian IPO. It says its optimal rate is two.
Jefferies analysts forecast the ratio will drop to about 3.3 by the end of 2020, including the two deals.
Budweiser APAC is set to price the IPO on Sept. 23 and the stock will debut on Sept. 30, the company statement said, adding it had lined up Singapore's sovereign wealth fund, GIC Pte Ltd, to invest $1 billion in the IPO.

JPMorgan (N:JPM) and  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS) are the joint sponsors of the flotation.

Anheuser Busch Inbev (BR:ABI), the brewer of everything from Budweiser to Stella Artois and Beck’s, has restarted the IPO process for its Asian business, according to The Wall Street Journal.
The news was enough to lift the stock 1.5% in early trading in Europe to its highest in over a month. That’s on a day when most markets were in cautious mood in the aftermath of the attacks on Saudi Arabia and ahead of the Federal Reserve’s two-day meeting.
By 5:15 AM ET (0915 GMT), the STOXX 600 was down less than 0.1%, as was the German DAX. The U.K. FTSE 100 was up 0.3%, largely a reflection of sterling's latest drop.
The Asian IPO is set to be a trimmed-down affair: after failing to agree with investors on valuation the first time around, it stripped out the mature Australian business and sold it to Japan’s Asahi for $11.3 billion.
What remains is a smaller, but faster-growing and more China-focused entity. According to the WSJ, the brewer is now targeting an overall valuation of $45.6 billion to $50.7 billion. The mid-point of that range is around 35 times next year’s estimated earnings, the paper adds.
The IPO volume could be as much as $4.84 billion. Even after the surgery to cut out the Australian ops, that could still leave the deal as the world’s second-biggest IPO this year after Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER). (Competition for that title from WeWork’s parent may be fading after the We Company reportedly delayed its prospective IPO for at least a month.)
Even the new valuation might seem ambitious to some. Prospective investors are being asked to bet on what is now a much higher-beta project where the prospects of faster sales growth have to be weighed against Chinese macroeconomic risk – specifically in the shape of foreign exchange risk. After four years of diligently-managed exchange rate stability, China has let the yuan slide by over 3% this year against the dollar. Where it might go to in the event of a fully-fledged trade war and a Chinese credit crunch is far from certain – even if Beijing does have a strong vested interest in preventing a further yuan depreciation in light of Chinese corporates high dollar indebtedness.
However, anything that reduces the company's debt burden is welcome to AB Inbev's management - and, apparently, its shareholders too."

48,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 17, 2019 08:13AM ET</span>","World to Become Hotter Than Expected, Updated French Climate Models Show","(Bloomberg) -- The world may become hotter than previously expected by the end of the century, according to a major study by some 100 of the top researchers in the field in France.
In the worst-case scenario, average global temperatures may rise 6 degrees to 7 degrees Celsius (10.8 degrees to 12.6 degrees Fahrenheit) by 2100, according to the work released by France’s National Center for Scientific Research CNRS, the atomic energy commission CEA and weather office Meteo-France.
That reading is about 1 degree Celsius hotter than previous projections. It’s also well above the 2-degree threshold endorsed by the United Nations. Beyond that level, storms are likely to become much more powerful and sea levels more than 1 meter higher.
The two updated models by the French researchers take a closer look at the regional effects of higher temperatures. They integrate the latest understanding of atmospheric physics and have higher resolution, CEA climate scientist Pascale Braconnot said in a press conference on Tuesday. All of the scenarios generated by the models predict “pronounced” and more severe global warming than the previous research completed in 2012, CNRS said in a statement.
“There’s a jump in quality in the result of the models for numerous indicators,” Braconnot said. “We have more confidence in the new version compared to the previous one.”
Updating the climate models required 500 million hours of calculations by supercomputers at Genci and Meteo-France, the weather office said in a statement. The research will contribute to part one of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s sixth assessment report, expected in 2021.
Only one of the updated climate models used by the researchers allowed for the global temperature increase to remain below 2 degrees Celsius by the end of the century.
The assumptions in that best-case scenario, called SSP1 1.9, include carbon neutrality by 2060 followed by a boost for carbon capture technology. That would also require lower population growth, a priority on sustainability and strong global cooperation to reduce pollution.
The worst-case scenario, called SSP5 8.5, assumes rapid economic growth driven by fossil fuels.
In the more pessimistic scenario, all summers in France by the end of the century will be hotter than the 2003 heatwave year, CNRS climate researcher Olivier Boucher said at the press conference.
Across Europe, heat waves will become longer and more intense, while the Arctic will be entirely ice-free during summer in the last two decades of this century.
“In 10,000 years, we haven’t explored anything as major as what we’re doing over a period of 100 years,” Braconnot said. The global temperature difference between the last ice age and the end of glaciation was 3 to 4 degrees Celsius, she said."

For the broker and a number of major fund managers it’s actually a blessing.
This month’s retreat in fixed income has fueled concerns about the possible risk to the equity bull run. Yet, so far, the stock market has defied the doomsayers, and the reason behind the jump in yields -- improved economic optimism -- has reassured the likes of  Eaton  (NYSE:ETN) Vance Management and Fidelity International that the rally can continue.
The flight from havens and crowded bond proxies has triggered a switch into equity sectors that are more sensitive to the economy. The broadening of the gains to include value and cyclical stocks will support the rally, said JPMorgan in a note to clients. In the past decade, equities rose every time bond yields spiked by at least 50 basis points, climbing by 6% on average, it said.
The cause for the shift in sentiment is key to understanding the equity market’s nonchalant attitude toward the bond market sell-off. The rise in yields happened amid optimism that the U.S.-China trade talks will continue, which is a positive signal for economic growth and as a consequence, for stocks.
“Government bond yields offer less of a signal for equity investors than they have in the past,” said Eddie Perkin, chief equity investment officer at Eaton Vance Management. “If bond yields are rising due to optimism about the economy, that should be good for equities, especially since a lot of recession fears had recently been priced into the equity market.”
If the yields continue to climb rapidly or the economic picture becomes overly rosy, fueling speculation about a halt to central bank rate cuts, things could “get scary” for stocks, according to Legal & General’s John Roe. But this appears unlikely, he said.
Modest investor positioning in stocks also supports the bulls. Despite the MSCI World Index posting a 17% return in 2019, investors have pulled $198 billion from global stocks, while $342 billion surged into bonds as traders sought havens amid trade-war-related concerns.
“Bond yields have moved too far year-to-date as we are not expecting a recession,” said Nick Peters, a multi-asset portfolio manager at Fidelity International, which oversees about $413 billion and favors equities. “As a result, we could see a sell-off in bonds without equities being impacted in the short term.”
Stocks are traditionally sensitive to sharp moves in debt, with the latest example occurring last month, when the inversion of the yield curve fueled a retreat from riskier assets. But the correlation between bonds and equities remains “resolutely” negative and higher yields shouldn’t pose a problem to stocks, according to JPMorgan.
“Higher yields usually go hand in hand with improving inflation and growth outlook,” said JPMorgan strategists led by Mislav Matejka. “This is usually a good combination for equities.”
This creates an environment for an equity rotation away from more defensive bond proxies and in favor of more volatile shares that are sensitive to economic growth. Financial and energy sectors have roared ahead in September, leaving the likes of real estate, healthcare and utilities behind.
The Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC). survey published on Tuesday showed that fund managers don’t expect this outperformance to last, with just 7% of surveyed investors forecasting that value equities will beat growth stocks over the next 12 months.
Eaton Vance, Wells Capital Management and GW&K Investment Management are among the funds that have picked up cyclical and value stocks this month. Just like bonds, growth and momentum stocks had gotten “too expensive” and this is a “healthy correction,” said Dan Miller, a director of equities at the $40-billion GW&K.
“If we do see growth expectations improve a little and inflation expectations firm a little, that could lead to an environment where yields rise and equity markets still tread water or help us touch new highs,” said Brian Jacobsen, a multi-asset strategist at Wells Capital Management."

52,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 17, 2019 07:41AM ET</span>",Size matters. Big U.S. farms get even bigger amid China trade war,"By Mark Weinraub
HAZELTON, N.D. (Reuters) - As the 2018 harvest approached, North Dakota farmer Mike Appert had a problem - too many soybeans and nowhere to put them. Selling was a bad option. Prices were near decade lows as U.S. President Donald Trump's trade war with China weighed heavily on the market. Temporary storage would only buy him a little bit of time, particularly in an area where cold weather can damage crops stored in plastic bags. 
So Appert, who farms 48,000 acres (19,425 hectares), cut a check for $800,000 to build eight new permanent steel bins. Thatallowed him to hold onto his bumper crop and wait for prices to recover. 
He sold half of the 456,000 bushels stored on his farm throughout the following summer, earning about $1 more per bushel and avoiding storage at nearby CHS elevators or an Archer Daniels Midland Co. (N:ADM) processor in the area.
But most farmers do not have $800,000 to spend on steel bins, and many are going under. The number of U.S. farms fell by 12,800 to 2.029 million in 2018, the smallest ever, as the trade war pushes more farmers into retirement or bankruptcy. 
Roger Hadley, who farms 1,000 acres in Indiana, was unable to plant any corn and soybeans this year after heavy rains added to farmers' woes.
He spent most of the summer trying to plant a combination of grasses, a so-called cover crop, so he could apply for government aid and try again next year. 
""The guys that got rich are getting richer,"" Hadley said. ""It has frustrated a lot of guys.""
In farming, size does matter. The farms left standing after the trade were will likely be some of the biggest in the business. Appert's operations are more than 100 times bigger than the average American farm and the advantages provided by that magnitude are becoming even more critical as the trade war stretches into a second year.
The declining number of U.S. farmers could hurt the world's top grain merchants such as ADM and  Bunge  (N:BG), who will have fewer suppliers. Additionally, farmers will have less need to rent space in the merchants' grain silos as big farmers like Appert have plentiful storage on their own farms.
ADM said it would continue changing to meet the needs of its customers. Bunge did not respond to an email seeking comment. 
By the end of 2018, the average U.S. farm size rose to 443 acres, a 12-year high and up from 441 million in 2017, according to the latest U.S. Department of Agriculture data. 
And the biggest farmers are growing their operations even more as retiring farmers choose to lease their land rather than selling it.
When land becomes available for lease, only the biggest farmers can readily shoulder the costs needed to expand.
The size of the loans smaller farmers would need to buy equipment, for example, are too big for applicants with little collateral, said Dave Kusler, president of the Bank of Hazelton in Hazelton, North Dakota. 
""It is almost impossible with what the costs are,"" Kuslersaid. ""In this area you can't make a living on 1,000 acres."" 
Critics say the Trump administration's policy of compensating growers for lost sales due to the trade war pays the bigger farm operations more, since payments are calculated by acres farmed. 
(For a graphic on Trump's trade war farm bailout: https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-TRADE/0100B0D90TN/USA-TRADE-CHINA:Soybeans.jpg)
The Environmental Working Group, a conservation organization, said in a recent study the top 1% of aid recipients received an average of more than $180,000 while the bottom 80% were paid less than $5,000 in aid. 
Appert said that big farmers receive bigger outright payments but less per acre than small farms because of a $500,000 cap per farm.
'BOOM, BOOM, BOOM'
Big farms can reap the full benefits of new high-tech equipment that boosts farm yields.
Doug Zink, who farms 35,000 acres near Carrington, North Dakota, said he likes to trade in his fleet of four combines and planters nearly every year to ensure that his equipment is under warranty, which saves thousands of dollars in maintenance costs and helps avoid breakdowns during key seeding and planting periods.
They also receive deep discounts - as much as $40,000 for some combine harvesters that can cost as much as $400,000 - allowing them to upgrade more often. 
Manufacturers are increasingly willing to cut such deals to keep clients as the number of customers falls. Deere & Co (N:DE) said that it will reduce production by 20% at its facilities in Illinois and Iowa in the second of half of the year. Rival agricultural machine makers AGCO Corp (N:AGCO) and CNH Industrial (N:CNHI) have also slashed production to keep inventory in line with retail demand.
Large farms also have the easiest access to capital, with bankers still eager to provide loans to growers with plenty of collateral. ""The ag trend is going to larger farms,"" Kusler, the bank president in Hazelton, North Dakota, said ""The loans get much larger.""
Appert had no problem getting a loan to finance expansion. 

""If you want to get a mortgage and buy a piece of land it is just boom, boom, boom,"" he said.

LONDON (Reuters) - Oil shed some of its gains on Tuesday as the United States raised the possibility of releasing crude reserves, while stocks inched lower as investors waited for this week's Federal Reserve meeting. 
Investors were noncommittal before the expected interest rate cut from the Fed on Wednesday and the next round of U.S.-China trade talks on Thursday.
U.S. stocks futures were lower, indicating an open in the red on Wall Street. 
European shares opened lower, with energy stocks giving up gains as crude prices eased. The pan-European STOXX 600 index dropped 0.2%. 
MSCI's All-Country World Index, which tracks shares across 47 countries, was down 0.1% on the day.
In Asia, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was down 0.76%. Chinese shares fell 1.68%. Hong Kong shares slumped 1.23%.
Brent crude oil, the international benchmark, fell 1.78% to $67.79 per barrel on Tuesday. On Monday, it surged as much as 14.6% for its biggest one-day percentage gain since at least 1988. 
U.S. West Texas Intermediate futures were down 1.70% to $61.85 per barrel following a 14.7% surge on Monday, the biggest one-day gain since December 2008.
Saturday's attack on Saudi oil facilities has halved the kingdom's oil output, creating the biggest disruption to global oil supplies in absolute terms since the overthrow of the Iranian Shah in 1979, International Energy Agency data show.
U.S. President Donald Trump has authorized the release of emergency crude stockpiles if needed, which could ease some upward pressure on crude futures.
Trump said on Monday it looked like Iran was behind the attacks but stressed that he did not want to go to war, striking a slightly less bellicose tone than his initial reaction.
Iran has rejected U.S. charges that it was behind the attacks. Tension between the two countries was already running high over Iran's suspected ambitions to assemble nuclear weapons. The strikes in Saudi Arabia are likely to raise regional tensions further.
SPARE CAPACITY
""Although Saudi Arabia's spare capacity and U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserves could plug some of the lost output, where oil trades in the near term will be influenced by how long it takes for Saudi production to fully recover,"" said Lukman Otunuga, research analyst at FXTM. 
""It is this concern over negative supply shocks amid geopolitical tensions which should keep oil prices buoyed in the short term."" 
The yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes slipped to 1.8223%. Euro zone government debt yields edged lower amid the geopolitical uncertainty stemming from the Saudi attack.
The dollar was flat against a basket of other currencies. 
The Fed is expected to cut interest rates at a policy meeting ending on Wednesday, although disagreement exists among policymakers.
Trump on Monday said on Twitter that the Fed should enact a ""big interest rate drop, stimulus"". However, historical precedent suggests the Fed is likely to cut the expected quarter of a point and go no further.
Futures contracts tied to the Fed's policy rate imply a 64.9% chance the U.S. central bank will cut its benchmark rate by a quarter of a point to a range of 1.75% to 2% on Wednesday.
Gold prices were higher by 0.04% at $1,498.52 per ounce. 

""To have a lasting impact on gold, much higher oil prices would be needed, i.e. well above $80 per barrel, in order to trigger a major inflationary shock, hitting the economy and slowing global growth,"" said Carsten Menke, commodity analyst at Julius Baer.

54,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 17, 2019 07:21AM ET</span>",Draghi’s QE Triumph Hinged on ECB Colleagues From Tiny Economies,"(Bloomberg) -- Mario Draghi’s controversial push to restart bond purchases counted on the support of European Central Bank policy makers who might never have expected to be so influential.
The president cited the backing of a “significant majority” and “very broad consensus” for the decision on Thursday. But around eight of the 25-member Governing Council opposed quantitative easing, including the Dutch, French and German central bank chiefs, meaning the addition of just a handful of others could have thwarted his plans.
That made the views of officials from the region’s smallest countries consequential. Among those supporting him were governors from the euro area’s two Mediterranean island economies, Malta and Cyprus, two of its Baltic members, Latvia and Lithuania, and possibly Luxembourg too. Those five make up 20% of the Governing Council -- but just 2% of the region’s population and 1.4% of its gross domestic product. Without them, his majority would have evaporated.
Seen in that context, the unprecedented resistance faced by Draghi highlights a stark geographical split. Support of governors mainly from southern Europe, and from small countries, allowed him to overcome resistance from colleagues whose economies form the heartland of the euro area, and more than half of it as measured by output and number of people.
“In every central bank that I know of, there’s a range of views at the moment about how do you deal with below-target inflation,” ECB Chief Economist Philip Lane said in London on Monday. “At the Fed or Bank of England, there’s not that many votes that are unanimous. There will be differences of views.”
In that sense, the ECB decision may mark the coming-of-age of an institution that is much younger than its global counterparts. It’s conceivable that the degree of opposition would have convinced former presidents Wim Duisenberg and Jean-Claude Trichet not to proceed. Last week’s outcome may set a precedent for future decisions on how sheer numbers in the room should carry the day.
That would complete Draghi’s shift away from the consensus-driven approach of his predecessors just as he prepares to hand over the reins to Christine Lagarde. She’s likely to preside over highly controversial decisions too, including whether to expand QE. Such a move might require an adjustment to the ECB’s self-imposed rules limiting bond purchases, which are intended as a safeguard against stepping into monetary financing.
Lagarde and Draghi can always cite the authority of being appointed by the collective decision of the region’s governments, an empowerment of legitimacy that national governors can’t match. But his claim of broad support from colleagues implicitly acknowledges that he can’t act alone, and that such backing is needed.
ECB policy makers -- comprising 19 governors and six Executive Board members -- all attend as individuals rather than as national representatives. Similarly, the institution doesn’t weight participation in accordance with population, unlike some European Union voting procedures.
“It’s very important to remember, everyone on the Governing Council is there as an individual,” Lane said. “Everyone there, in the Governing Council, is making an assessment of what is a good idea for the euro area.”
Draghi didn’t call a vote on QE because he judged that bulk of policy makers were behind him. Resorting to such a device is rare, in any case.
Under the formal rules, which rotate voting every month to streamline decisions, the French and Estonian governors -- both of whom were opposed to bond purchases -- couldn’t have cast ballots this time. But it wouldn’t really have changed the size of the swing needed either way."
55,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 17, 2019 07:11AM ET</span>",WeWork delays IPO after frosty investor response,"By Joshua Franklin and Anirban Sen
(Reuters) - WeWork owner The We Company has postponed its initial public offering (IPO), walking away from preparations to launch it this month after a lackluster response from investors to its plans.
The U.S. office-sharing startup was getting ready to launch an investor road show for its IPO this week before making the last-minute decision on Monday to stand down, people familiar with the matter said. 
The company has been under pressure to proceed with the stock market flotation to secure funding for its operations.
In the run-up to the launch of its IPO, We Company has faced concerns about its corporate governance standards, as well as the sustainability of its business model, which relies on a mix of long-term liabilities and short-term revenue, and how such a model would weather an economic downturn.
Reuters reported last week that We Company might seek a valuation in its IPO of between $10 billion and $12 billion, a dramatic discount to the $47 billion valuation it achieved in January.
""The We Company is looking forward to our upcoming IPO, which we expect to be completed by the end of the year. We want to thank all of our employees, members and partners for their ongoing commitment,"" the company said in a short statement.
Were We Company to have pressed on with the IPO at such a low valuation, it would have represented a major turning point in the growth over the last decade of the venture capital industry, which has led to the rise of startups such as  Uber Technologies Inc  (N:UBER),  Snap Inc  (N:SNAP) and Airbnb Inc.
It would have meant that We Company would be valued at less than the $12.8 billion in equity it has raised since it was founded in 2010, according to data provider Crunchbase. And it would have been a blow to its biggest backer, Japan's SoftBank Group Corp (T:9984), at a time when it is trying to amass $108 billion from investors for its second Vision Fund.
SoftBank was discussing supporting the IPO by snapping up shares worth between $750 million and $1 billion, the sources said. However, We Company decided on Monday that even with SoftBank's support, the IPO would have raised a little over than $2 billion, short of its target of at least $3 billion.
This target is tied to a $6 billion credit line We Company secured from banks last month, that calls for an IPO to take place by the end of the year and raise at least $3 billion, one of the sources said. 
Were the New York-based company to fail to meet this target by the end of the year, it would need to secure alternative funding.
The Wall Street Journal first reported on the potential IPO delay. 
The sources who spoke to Reuters requested anonymity because the matter is confidential. 
The last time SoftBank invested in We Company was in January at the $47 billion valuation, injecting $2 billion of cash. It had been pushing the company to delay its IPO.
JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) and  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS) had been tasked with leading We Company's IPO as underwriters. 
GOVERNANCE CHANGES
We Company's decision to delay its IPO indicates it did not feel confident that the corporate governance changes it unveiled on Friday, slightly loosening CEO and co-founder Adam Neumann's grip on the company, was enough to woo investors concerned about its lack of a path to profitability.
We Company had said it was making the changes ""in response to market feedback"". It said Neumann's superior voting shares will decrease to 10 votes per share from 20, though he will retain majority control of the company.
Neumann will also give the company any profit he receives from real estate deals he has entered in to with We Company. He will also limit his ability to sell shares in the second and third years after the IPO to no more than 10% of his stock.
No member of Neumann's family will be on the company's board and any successor will be selected by the board, scrapping a plan for his wife and co-founder, Rebekah Neumann, to help pick the successor.
The WeWork brand is strongly tied to Neumann, a freewheeling 40-year-old Israeli-born entrepreneur who has said that We Company's mission is ""to elevate the world's consciousness"". 

Rebekah Neumann serves as the chief brand officer.

(Reuters) - Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) on Tuesday said it would award Corning Inc $250 million from a $5 billion fund dedicated to U.S. advanced manufacturing.
Corning supplies glass to Apple for products such as the iPhone and Apple Watch. Since the first iPhones hit the market in 2007, the glass on every iPhone sold has been produced at Corning’s Harrodsburg, Kentucky, plant.
Apple and Corning did not disclose the terms of the deal. In the past, Apple has made long-term supply agreements https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apple-finisar/apple-grants-390-million-to-finisar-to-boost-laser-chip-production-idUSKBN1E71EA with its vendors in which it provides upfront cash to lock in supplies of parts and better prices. The supplier, in turn, gets capital to carry out research and development or upgrade factories.
With few exceptions, Apple devices are assembled in China, where the company's supply chain has become increasingly concentrated over the past five years. The clustering has put Apple at the center of the trade war between the United States and China.
Tariffs on many Apple products such as AirPods wireless headphones took effect on Sept. 1, with most analysts expecting Apple to absorb the cost of the levies if required to pay them. Apple has not disclosed any financial impacts specifically related to tariffs.
In the meantime, Apple has spent the past several years emphasizing its supplier base in the United States.
Apple announced its fund for U.S. suppliers in 2017, setting aside $1 billion and boosting the figure to $5 billion a year later. The company said it spent $60 billion with more than 9,000 U.S. suppliers in 2018.
Counting $200 million in 2017, Corning has now received $450 million from Apple's fund. Apple said in a statement that its spending with Corning supports 1,000 jobs at Corning, including about 400 manufacturing jobs at the plant in Kentucky.
""This award underscores Apple and Corning's shared belief in the vital role that ingenuity plays in creating industry-leading products, and the pride that both companies take in applying American innovation and advanced manufacturing to solve some of the world's toughest technology challenges,"" Apple Chief Operating Officer Jeff Williams (NYSE:WMB) said in a statement.
Apple has now awarded $1 billion from the fund. Other awards were $390 million to chipmaker Finisar Corp, which makes chips for Apple's facial recognition technology in Texas, and $10 million for a joint venture between  Alcoa  (NYSE:AA) Corp and Rio Tinto's aluminum business to develop a carbon-free aluminum smelting process."

KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysia has set up a panel to fast-track investments as it seeks to woo businesses affected by the U.S.-China trade dispute and it approved more than $500 million in new proposals this month, a government minister said.
An increasing number of U.S. and Chinese businesses have been moving manufacturing out of China to escape tit-for-tat tariffs imposed on each other's products.
Malaysia's new National Committee on Investment I (NCII) aims to encourage investment in Southeast Asia's third-biggest economy and it approved investments worth 2.2 billion ringgit ($526 million) in its first meeting, the minister said.
""If approvals took three months earlier, now it would take a month - from when the documentation is complete to when the committee will approve it,"" Ong Kian Ming, deputy minister in the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, told Reuters.
""It would try to expedite investments that are relocating because of the U.S.-China trade conflict,"" he said in a recent interview.
Vietnam has been widely seen as the biggest beneficiary of businesses relocating to escape the higher U.S. tariffs on goods produced in China, but Thailand has also introduced a package of incentives to attract relocations.
Foreign direct investment (FDI) to Malaysia nearly doubled to 50 billion ringgit ($12 billion) in the first half of this year, of which over half went to manufacturing. Ong said he was hopeful of an even bigger rise in the second half of the year.
The new committee is headed by the ministers of finance and international trade and industry and they have the authority approve incentives immediately. Ong declined to give details of the specific deals it had approved.
U.S. investment topped $5.62 billion in the first half of 2019 and Ong said he expected that to pick up further.
 Intel Corp  (O:INTC), Dell Technologies Inc (N:DELL) and On Semiconductor Corp (O:ON) are the lead players in Malaysia's well-established electrical & electronics (E&E) industry.
""We do see re-investments coming from existing U.S. companies and new E&E players coming to Malaysia. I know of at least one company that has expressed its very serious interest to come to Malaysia. This is a new factory that will be built,"" he said, without identifying the company.
Ong said the number of investment applications from China had risen in recent months and its FDI could rise in the last six months after dipping to 5.1 billion ringgit in the first half from 5.69 billion ringgit a year earlier."
61,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 17, 2019 06:18AM ET</span>",WeWork Postpones Long-Awaited Listing as Valuations Plummet,"(Bloomberg) -- WeWork pushed back its much-awaited initial public offering, and said it now expects to complete the listing by the end of this year as concerns mount over the company’s governance, valuation and business prospects.
Bloomberg News reported earlier that the offering is likely to be postponed until at least October. WeWork had planned to begin making its pitch to investors in a roadshow as soon as this week.
“The We Co. is looking forward to our upcoming IPO, which we expect to be completed by the end of the year,” the company said in a statement on Monday evening in New York. “We want to thank all of our employees, members and partners for their ongoing commitment.”
SoftBank Group Corp., the office-rental company’s biggest investor, had pressed WeWork to put off the stock offering amid doubts about the business, people familiar with the matter said previously.
In January, SoftBank made its last investment in WeWork, renamed the We Co., at a valuation of $47 billion. The company was more recently expected to be valued at only about $15 billion in a listing and perhaps even less, people familiar with the matter have said.
The decision to postpone the listing will at least temporarily sideline an important source of capital for the money-losing business and could threaten a $6 billion credit financing that was contingent on a successful offering. The facility requires the company to carry out its IPO by Dec. 31, Bloomberg News previously reported.
The biggest backers of SoftBank’s $100 billion Vision Fund are now reconsidering how much to commit to its next investment vehicle after the oversized bet on WeWork soured. Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund, which contributed $45 billion to the gargantuan fund, is now only planning to reinvest profits from that vehicle into its successor, according to people familiar with the talks.
Vision Fund
Abu Dhabi’s Mubadala Investment Co., which invested $15 billion in the Vision Fund, is considering paring its future commitment to below $10 billion, the people said, asking not to be identified in disclosing internal deliberations.
The delay also adds another sour note to a medley of high-profile but frequently disappointing IPOs this year. The offering was expected to have been the biggest after Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc.’s $8.1 billion listing and ahead of Avantor Inc.’s $3.3 billion IPO and the $2.3 billion offering by Uber’s ride-hailing rival  Lyft  Inc (NASDAQ:LYFT). Of those three, only Avantor is trading above its offer price.
WeWork’s likely delay was reported earlier by the Wall Street Journal.
WeWork has become an extreme example of the excesses afforded to technology entrepreneurs in the era of unicorns -- startups valued at $1 billion or more. Adam Neumann, WeWork’s co-founder and chief executive officer, was able to raise billions of dollars at astronomical valuations and spend freely, while retaining effective control over operations through special classes of stock.
In an effort to keep its IPO on track, WeWork last week took steps to limit Neumann’s control of the company after an IPO, as well as other measures to improve its corporate governance."

63,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 17, 2019 03:53AM ET</span>","With a backup to the backup, insulin makers say they're primed for Brexit","By Kate Holton and Paul Sandle
LONDON (Reuters) - For two men trained as scientists, the bosses of Britain's major insulin providers have had to become experts in ferry schedules, trucking laws and warehouse capacity as they seek to guarantee the supply of life-saving drugs through a chaotic Brexit.
With Britain set to leave the European Union within weeks, Pinder Sahota at the world's biggest insulin maker  Novo Nordisk  (CSE:NOVOb), and Sanofi's Hugo Fry have rebuilt operations to withstand the most turbulent of events. 
The two companies told Reuters they had spent millions of pounds, which they cannot recoup, stockpiling millions of packets of insulin - used to treat diabetes - inside Britain and building new shipping and air freight routes.
Their plans, formulated over three years, show the lengths companies across the continent are having to go to overhaul long-standing supply chains that may not survive Britain's biggest trade upheaval in half a century.
""There is nothing comparable to this,"" Novo Nordisk's UK General Manager Sahota told Reuters of the Danish company's preparation. ""It's unprecedented from a logistics point of view. We're preparing for the worst-case scenario, the most extreme.""
With two Brexit deadlines already been and gone, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has vowed to take Britain out of the EU with or without a deal by Oct. 31 - increasing the chance of a sudden departure that brings trade tariffs and customs checks with the continent for the first time in decades. 
The government's own planning shows that, in a worst-case scenario, lorries seeking to enter Europe at the French port of Calais could face delays of two-and-a-half days, creating supply disruptions that could last for months.
That poses a real risk for the pharmaceutical industry which imports 37 million packs of drugs from Europe a month. According to the government, three-quarters come via that route. 
While Britain's GSK and AstraZeneca are world leaders in respiratory and cardiovascular treatments, Britain's insulin is imported.
""In the case of pharmaceuticals, you can't just throw things onto a boat or a lorry, you have to test and validate these routes into the country,"" Fry told Reuters in his office to the west of London, adding they had backups to their backup plans. 
Both Sanofi (PA:SASY) and Novo Nordisk have reserved space on ferries going the longer route to eastern English ports to avoid the main Calais-Dover crossing if needed, and also air freight if required. 
""We anticipate that route is going to become congested so what we've done is open up other routes,"" said Sahota. ""So two other routes that we've opened up are Denmark to Immingham (in north-east England) and Netherlands to Immingham.""
SKY-HIGH STOCKPILES
Novo Nordisk, Britain's biggest insulin supplier, has tripled its warehouse capacity to hold 18 weeks' worth of stock - 3.8 million packs that piled high would stand 12 times the height of the London Shard skyscraper. 
Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) of the United States and France's Sanofi, the country's second and third-biggest suppliers, have similar stockpiles.
Frustration is growing that while they dedicate huge resources to such preparation, they are spending less time on their normal jobs.
""When we're doing this, we're not doing other stuff,"" Fry said. ""We're not working on projects that will bring our most innovative products to the market. 
""Although we are happy to do it, it is starting to weigh on our balance sheet, on our logistics, keeping all this additional stock in the country. It's not an ideal situation."" 
The companies are confident they will be able to guarantee the British supply of insulin to the around 1 million diabetes patients who need it. 
But some patients like Georgina from London, who was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes more than 30 years ago, have become increasingly alarmed as the chances have grown of Britain leaving the EU without a deal to govern their trading relationship.
""For me, I can't tell you how worried I am about that. It's life-threatening for me,"" she said, declining to give her last name. She added that she also worried about older patients she encountered at clinics.
The British government is organising a regular freight service reserved just for drugs as part of its preparations alongside industry for Brexit on Oct. 31. 
""We are doing everything we can to help ensure the supply of medicines and medical products remains uninterrupted, including insulin,"" said the department of health and social care. 
The two drug companies did not say how much their Brexit preparations had cost, beyond many millions of pounds. With fixed contracts with Britain's health service, they cannot raise prices. 
Both Fry and Sahota have had to delve into arcane areas of transport. 
As part of their planning, for example, they have had to factor in how many drivers are needed to avoid breaking legally mandated rest laws, how long refrigerated lorries can operate in one stretch, and what happens in the event of fuel shortages. 

""We're doing everything we can,"" said Fry. ""I know more about ferry crossings now than I ever thought I would.""

The Swedish lender fired its CEO and its chairman resigned in the wake of the allegations being investigated by authorities in Sweden, the Baltics and the United States.
The new chairman, former Swedish Prime Minister Goran Persson, has promised full transparency.
But until now the bank has refused requests from Sweden's Economic Crime Authority (ECA) to interview a lawyer who Swedbank employed to investigate its compliance with anti-money laundering regulations.
""Swedbank's board has decided to meet a request from the Swedish Economic Crime authority to waive attorney-client privilege regarding attorney Erling Grimstad's assignments for Swedbank,"" the bank said in a statement on Tuesday.
ECA prosecutor Thomas Langrot wrote to Swedbank's interim CEO Anders Karlsson and Chairman Goran Persson this month to repeat the request to interview Norwegian lawyer Grimstad.
Swedbank has handed over reports written by Grimstad to the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority, which is also conducting an investigation.
In its clearest admission of fault since the scandal broke early this year, Swedbank said its anti-money laundering processes had been and still were insufficient, both in Sweden and Estonia.
""The division of responsibilities within the bank has not been clear enough and the bank has not always complied with internal policies,"" it said.
The bank said it had appointed a chief compliance officer and would provide more information on its work to combat money laundering alongside its quarterly report on Oct. 23."

67,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 17, 2019 01:16AM ET</span>",U.S. value fund managers betting shift to value stocks won't last,"By David Randall
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The massive U.S. market rotation into value stocks over the last two weeks is finally giving value fund managers a reason to be hopeful after years of underperformance.
Yet portfolio managers from firms such as Hillman Funds, Artisan Partners and  Eaton  (NYSE:ETN) Vance say that they are taking the rally in value stocks - so called because they trade at cheaper valuations than the rapidly expanding companies in the growth stock category - to sell some of their best performers and move into companies that are further out of favor. The move is based on views that the market's shift to value stocks will not last.
Among the companies that value funds are unloading are energy stocks, which surged 2.2% on Monday after an attack on Saudi Arabian crude facilities knocked out 5% of the world's supply.
""I'm a little skeptical that this has legs,"" said Aaron Dunn, co-director of value equity at Eaton Vance, noting that a sell-side firm his fund works with told him that they were seeing few buy orders from long-only funds and getting more of their business from quantitative-based strategies. ""This is more of a momentum reversal and the valuations aren't that compelling anymore.""
Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) and JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) argue that the U.S. rotation into value - which has also been seen in Europe - may run further. Yet investors like Dunn argue that the move into value is fleeting.
Dunn said he continues to focus on companies like business jet company  Textron Inc  (N:TXT) and hot water heater manufacturer A.O. Smith Corp (N:AOS), which have posted weak results lately but have better long-term prospects.
MARKET SHIFT
Perceived improvement in U.S.-China trade negotiations and better-than-expected U.S. economic data helped ease investor concern about an impending recession, lifting bond yields and sparking the market rotation into value stocks, according to research from Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS). At the same time, the rotation has pushed momentum stocks like plant-based meat company  Beyond Meat Inc  (O:BYND) and restaurant chain  Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc  (N:CMG) into their worst two-week return since 2009.
""These catalysts released the potential energy created by investor crowding"" while also propping up beaten-down small-cap stocks, according to a note from the firm.
At the same time, the steep increase in the yield of the benchmark 10-year Treasury note - whose jump from 1.45% at the beginning of September to 1.85% on Monday was the largest two-week gain since November 2016 - is helping boost the shares of financial companies that reap higher profits from interest rates, said Jonathan Golub, chief U.S. equity strategist at  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Securities.
""This looks more like a reprieve for value than a longer-term trend,"" he said. ""The real question for value is, 'Do you believe that interest rates will continue to go higher when all indications are that the economy will remain sluggish for the remainder of the year?'""
Mark Hillman, whose 25% gain in his Hillman Fund puts it among the top-performing large-cap value funds tracked by Morningstar this year, said the recent market rotation is sending many value stocks closer to their fair market value.
He is focusing on companies that look like they remain significantly undervalued, such as retailer  Nordstrom Inc  (N:JWN) and food company Kraft Heinz Co (O:KHC).
""We still think there is plenty of opportunity in this space,"" he said.
Thomas Reynolds, a portfolio manager of the Artisan Value Equity fund, said the underperformance of large technology and communications companies suggests investors are moving out of the most-crowded trades.
""People have been looking at these huge tech companies with strong balance sheets almost as a safety play,"" he said.
Any shift away from that mindset could continue to help companies like brokerage firm E Trade Financial Corp (O:ETFC), which is up more than 9% since the start of the month, he said.
""There are lots of companies out there that the market has ignored because their stories have not been perfect,"" he said.
The surge in value stocks could help push the broad stock market to new highs as investor fears of an imminent recession ease, said Charles Lemonides, founder of hedge-fund ValueWorks LLC, who has been moving into shares of companies like  United Natural Foods  Inc (N:UNFI) and  Transocean  Ltd (S:RIGN).
The benchmark S&P 500 is about 1.2% below its record high of 3,027.98.
""The advance has finally broadened out and the old narrow leadership has come down in price,"" said Lemonides, adding that he believes the S&P 500 will soon trade above 3,300. ""As a group value stocks will likely be stable, and the exciting names will be 20 percent higher and still be below their old highs."""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Two  Prudential  (LON:PRU) subsidiaries have agreed to pay nearly $33 million to settle charges they failed to disclose conflicts of interest and made misleading disclosures regarding 94 insurance-dedicated mutual funds they advised, the U.S. securities regulator said on Monday.
The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) said it had censured AST Investment Services Inc and PGIM Investments LLC, requiring them to disgorge $27.6 million and pay a civil fine of $5 million. The subsidiaries did not admit or deny the SEC's findings, the SEC said. 
The SEC acknowledged that AST and PGIM self-reported their misconduct, cooperated with its investigation and had voluntarily reimbursed the funds more than $155 million. 
In 2006, Prudential reorganized its mutual fund business so it could receive certain tax benefits, the SEC said. 
This move benefited Prudential but the funds advised by the company's two subsidiaries wound up losing income from a temporary recall of securities the mutual funds had out on loan.
Neither Prudential nor the subsidiary disclose any potential conflict of interest to the affected mutual fund clients about the connection between the company reorganization and the recalls.
Monday's settlement comes as the SEC is seeking to stamp out undisclosed conflicts of interest among investment advisers and their clients.
""Investment advisers must be vigilant in monitoring for conflicts related to actions taken by affiliates, and must act consistently with their representations to their clients,"" said Dabney O’Riordan, co-chief of the SEC Enforcement Division's Asset Management Unit. 
""Here, AST and PI acted to benefit their parent company despite the costs those acts imposed on their clients.""

News of the possible job cuts came a day after the company, which supplies display screens supplier to Apple (O:AAPL), announced Chief Executive Han Sang-beom had stepped down following an emergency board meeting.
The company did not put a figure on how many of its around 23,000 South Korean production line workers it hoped would take up its offer.
LG Display has been struggling with a global supply glut in liquid-crystal displays (LCDs) used in television sets, which has pushed down prices.
The South Korean company is shifting its mainstay liquid LCD business toward next-generation organic light-emitting diode (OLED) panels, which cost massive investment, as the LCD panel industry is crowded with Chinese rivals. 
A company spokeswoman, Jean Lee, said the cuts were part of an emergency plan to increase cost efficiencies in panel production as well as other expenses.

LG Display said it planned to take voluntary redundancy applications from Korean workers who had been at the company five years or more over the next few weeks. The company has 59,000 employees globally, including in China.

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - When the sun comes up in Beijing on Oct. 1, the Chinese government will aim to celebrate its 70th birthday under a brilliant blue sky - and factory bosses hope they can get through it without blanket closures.
During previous big events in a capital long plagued by festering pollution, the government has pulled out all the stops to guarantee air quality - seeding clouds for rain to wash the pollution away, restricting traffic, and shutting factories, shops and construction sites.    
Beijing will close building sites, curb fireworks and restrict fuel sales ahead of the National Day celebrating the founding of the People's Republic of China. But government officials say the era of economically disruptive ""one-size-fits-all"" crackdowns is over, replaced by a more nuanced approach at a time when the country's economy is creaking under the pressure of its trade war with the United States.
Though there is still time for a clampdown, executives at major heavy industrial firms believe sweeping closures are not yet on the agenda - as long as routine smog controls continue to do the job. An independent survey last week showed Beijing is on track to drop out from the list of the world's top 200 most-polluted cities this year.
China's biggest cement producer, China National Building Materials Corp (HK:3323), is one that hasn't yet received any formal notification, and doesn't expect special measures. 
""I think that if there are measures they won't necessarily be connected with National Day,"" Cui Xingtai, vice-president of the state-run company with facilities across the country, told Reuters during a recent interview. ""In certain seasons, some places can introduce policies to alleviate the extent of air pollution.""
Elsewhere, officials with three small independent refineries in Shandong province, south of the capital, also told Reuters they were not anticipating stiffer cuts in production before October.
Provincial authorities do have the Oct. 1 anniversary in focus: Hebei, which surrounds Beijing, has launched an inspection of coal mines which it explicitly says is designed to prevent any accident ahead of the anniversary celebrations.
Meanwhile the province has imposed production curbs in Tangshan, China's biggest steelmaking city, after a rise in smog earlier this month. 
""The Tangshan plan didn't mention National Day but it's clearly a big part of the motivation,"" said Lauri Myllyvirta, senior energy analyst with Greenpeace. 
As Oct. 1 approaches, industry sources said production cuts could get tougher, especially in Tangshan and other cities close to Beijing, but comprehensive shutdowns were still unlikely.
The environment ministry said on Tuesday that mostly favorable weather would keep pollution in check over September, though concentrations of small floating particles known as PM2.5 were forecast to rise slightly in Beijing in the last 10 days of the month.
""There has been no official notice, though there's still time,"" said an industry consultant with ties to the Tangshan Iron and Steel Association who declined to be identified because he wasn't authorized to speak to media. ""Controls will definitely be stricter before National Day.""
Liu Qingxi, manager of a cement plant owned by  Anhui Conch  (SS:600585) in Tongling city, about 1,200 kilometers south of Beijing by road, told Reuters the company only expected to take action if air quality deteriorated significantly.
""We've not been told anything yet but if there are bad weather conditions they might ask us to stop production,"" he said."

(Reuters) - OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma LP filed for bankruptcy protection after reaching a partial deal to resolve more than 2,600 lawsuits alleging it helped fuel the U.S. opioid crisis.
Supporters of Purdue's plan to restructure under terms of a settlement the company values at more than $10 billion include 24 states and five U.S. territories, as well as lead lawyers for more than 2,000 cities, counties and other plaintiffs suing the company and, in some cases, its controlling Sackler family. 
On the other side are two dozen states that remain opposed or uncommitted to the proposed settlement, setting the stage for contentious legal battles over who bears responsibility for a public health crisis that has claimed the lives of nearly 400,000 people between 1999 and 2017, according to the latest U.S. data.
Purdue and the Sacklers have denied allegations in lawsuits alleging they aggressively marketed addictive prescription painkillers while misleading doctors and patients about their abuse and overdose risks. 
The following are among the key legal battles ahead, pitting states such as Massachusetts, New York and Connecticut against Purdue and the Sacklers. 
PURDUE
*Purdue will soon ask U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Robert Drain to halt all its lawsuits. The company is preparing for states to argue their lawsuits cannot be stopped because their legal actions were brought to enforce public health and safety laws - exempting them from the usual bankruptcy rules that would pause their complaints. 
Purdue Chairman Steve Miller in an interview on Sunday night said continued litigation in bankruptcy would deplete the company's assets. Purdue projected spending $263 million this year on legal and professional fees, with nearly half devoted to opioid litigation alone, according to bankruptcy-court records. The legal skirmishes begin with Purdue's first-day bankruptcy hearing on Tuesday in a White Plains, New York, federal court. 
*Purdue still faces U.S. Justice Department criminal and civil investigations over its handling of OxyContin. Any financial penalty emerging from those cases could eat into recoveries for cities, counties and states suing the company and the Sacklers. Purdue has responded to subpoenas and other investigative demands from federal prosecutors and is engaged in discussions with U.S. officials to resolve the probes, the company said in bankruptcy-court papers. 
THE SACKLERS
*Purdue also said it would seek to stop lawsuits against current and former owners and directors - a veiled reference to the Sacklers. Many states have vowed to continue pursuing the family, and have pushed them to guarantee more money toward a settlement. The Sacklers so far have not budged from a proposal to pay $3 billion over seven years and an additional $1.5 billion or more through an eventual sale of another business they own called Mundipharma. 
The Sacklers on Sunday night said they hope opposing states would ""shift their focus to the critical resources that the settlement provides to people and problems that need them."" 
*The Sacklers could attempt to use bankruptcy proceedings to largely shield themselves from future legal exposure and the possible financial liabilities associated with it. Settlements approved in bankruptcy court often come with legal releases. Some states are likely to fight that. 
Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey on Monday said Purdue's Chapter 11 proceedings ""should not be about billionaires looking to use the bankruptcy process as a vehicle to further shield their assets and escape accountability."" 
New York Attorney General Letitia James has subpoenaed Wall Street banks, Purdue corporate entities and family offices for records related to the Sackler's finances. On Monday, she said her office ""will not be deterred in its lawsuit against the Sackler family."" On Friday, she highlighted wire transfers made by former Purdue board member Mortimer D.A. Sackler, including some made through Swiss bank accounts. A Sackler representative said the decade-old transfers were legal and appropriate. 

""We will move aggressively in bankruptcy to disclose their hidden fortune and ensure their full wealth is now on the table,"" Connecticut Attorney General William Tong said in a statement on Monday.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Deputy-level U.S.-China trade talks are scheduled to start in Washington on Thursday, the U.S. Trade Representative's office said on Monday, paving the way for high-level talks in October aimed at resolving a bitter, 14-month trade war.
A USTR spokesman did not offer any further details about the deputy-level talks. 
Earlier, U.S. Chamber of Commerce Chief Executive Tom Donohue said U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer told business executives he was seeking a ""real agreement"" that addresses intellectual property and technology transfer issues first raised by the USTR two years ago.
Donohue, speaking at a news conference to urge congressional approval of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement, said Lighthizer ""did indicate that there was some movement in the direction of purchasing of (U.S.) agricultural products and other issues"".
But Lighthizer gave no indication the talks may produce an interim deal with a more limited scope, as suggested by some media reports, Donohue said.
The head of the biggest U.S. business lobbying group added it would be difficult to secure an agreement fully addressing U.S. demands for sweeping changes to China's intellectual property and technology transfer practices, market access and subsidy issues.
""While I'm optimistic about it, I'm also a dead-ass realist and this is not a simple problem,"" Donohue said of the new round of talks.
Leading the Chinese delegation in the deputy-level talks will be Vice Finance Minister Liao Min, the Chinese commerce ministry said on Tuesday.
The visit will pave the way for the China-U.S. high-level economic and trade consultations in Washington next month, the ministry added. 
Lighthizer and U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin are expected to meet with China's top negotiator, Vice Premier Liu He, in early October.
President Donald Trump last week delayed a tariff increase that had been scheduled for Oct. 1 on $250 billion worth of Chinese goods after China also delayed tariffs on some U.S. imports.
The world's two largest economies have not held in-person talks since late July toward resolving their 14-month trade war, which has roiled markets, disrupted supply chains and threatened global growth. 
Economic factors are weighing on both sides, said Stephen Kho, former acting chief counsel on China enforcement at USTR who is now a partner at Akin Gump law firm.

""Both sides are feeling the pain now. So an interim deal could be done, but if they're looking for a comprehensive deal ... that will be very hard,"" Kho said.

(Reuters) - Energy stocks spiked while most of Wall Street fell on Monday after weekend attacks on Saudi Arabia's oil facilities added to investors' concerns about geopolitical risk and a stumbling global economy.
The attacks on the world's biggest crude exporter sent oil prices up more than 20% before they eased, as various nations said they would tap emergency reserves to ensure stable supplies.
The S&P 500 energy index (SPNY), a gauge of one of the worst performing sectors so far this year, soared 3.3%, its largest one-day gain since January. Shares of  Apache Corp  (N:APA), Helmerich and Payne (N:HP) and  Cimarex Energy  (N:XEC) jumped between 12% and 17% and led gainers on the S&P 500.
The Saudi-led military coalition battling Yemen's Houthi movement said the attacks were carried out with Iranian weapons, raising the prospect of a global conflict involving the United States and Iran.
""The U.S. investor is waiting with bated breath about what the U.S. and its allies might do,"" said Jake Dollarhide, chief executive officer of Longbow Asset Management in Tulsa, Oklahoma.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - New Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) chief Stephen Dickson plans to fly to Seattle this week to fly ""newly configured"" Boeing 737 MAX software in a simulator and will visit with Boeing (N:BA) officials, the agency said Monday.
Boeing plans to revise the 737 MAX software to take input from both angle-of-attack sensors in the MCAS anti-stall system linked to two deadly crashes that led to a global grounding of the plane in March. But it is not clear when it will conduct a key certification test flight, a step needed before the FAA can return the plane to service.
The FAA confirmed that Dickson, who took over as administrator in mid-August, has no firm timeline for the grounded 737 MAX to resume flights or when Boeing will turn over final documentation. The FAA said Dickson also plans to visit with the FAA aircraft certification team in Seattle.
Separately, a spokeswoman for Representative Peter DeFazio, who chairs the House Transportation Committee, confirmed that Boeing had declined his invitation to testify at an upcoming House hearing.
""Boeing is working diligently and transparently with committees in both the House (of Representatives) and the Senate to ensure that proper information is being shared and we will continue to do so,"" the company said in an e-mailed statement.
Boeing's board is expected to consider changes proposed by a board committee later this week, people briefed on the matter said. Reuters reported in August that the committee review would find the company needs to reorganize its engineering reporting lines company-wide and ensure higher ranking officials, including its CEO, get faster feedback about potential safety concerns from lower levels of the company.
The changes are intended to boost the transparency of engineering decisions and accelerate efforts to share safety information as widely and swiftly as possible across Boeing's global businesses and factories, Reuters reported.
Boeing has said it plans to conduct a certification test flight in the ""September time frame"" but Boeing Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg did not give a specific date when asked last week.
Federal prosecutors aided by the FBI, the Department of Transportation's inspector general and several blue-ribbon panels are investigating the 737 MAX as well as how the FAA certifies new aircraft.

Major U.S. airlines have canceled flights into December as a result of the MAX grounding, including  American Airlines Group  Inc (O:AAL) and United Airlines (O:UAL), while Southwest Airlines Co (N:LUV) has canceled flights into early January.

DETROIT (Reuters) - An all-electric pickup truck and an advanced battery system will be part of the $7 billion that General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) has pledged to invest in the United States as parts of contract talks with the United Auto Workers.
The automaker and the union were continuing talks late on Monday to resolve a strike by 48,000 hourly workers that shut down GM's highly profitable U.S. operations.
GM said on Saturday it would make investments in eight facilities in four states, but did not specify timing, location or products other than the electric pickup and a battery cell plant.
GM plans to invest both in advanced propulsion systems for electric vehicles and in core products such as trucks and utility vehicles that generate much of its profit, the company said on Monday.
Some of that investment is earmarked for the production of electric vehicles in Michigan and battery cells in Ohio, sources said. 
GM also is expected to update plants in Michigan, Tennessee and Missouri to build redesigned versions of its midsize pickups and crossovers, according to a GM source. The company said it will invest in “additional new vehicle and propulsion programs,” but said nothing about opening new plants.
""With as much excess capacity as GM still has, the company won't be opening any new plants for the foreseeable future,"" said AutoForecast Solutions Vice President Sam Fiorani. 
GM has said it plans to introduce a stable of electric vehicles by 2023, but has not provided details. Sources have said those vehicles will feature an advanced battery system and a new vehicle structure that is flexible and modular, to accommodate different vehicle types and sizes.
Over the past three years, GM has spent an average $8.45 billion a year on capital expenditures. Most of that investment was made in North America, another GM source said. 
The $7 billion investment pledged to the UAW works out to less than $2 billion a year over the four-year life of the proposed contract. 
Reuters last week disclosed that GM plans to introduce a full-size electric pickup in 2022, citing officials familiar with the company's plans.
On Monday, a person familiar with GM's offer to the UAW said the company could produce the electric truck at the Detroit-Hamtramck plant that now has no future assignment.

GM could also build an electric vehicle battery plant near its shuttered assembly plant in Lordstown, Ohio.

The market pullback came after the major indexes had just enjoyed three-straight weeks of gains in a rally set off on hopes that the U.S.-China trade war could ease. Instead, tension in the Middle East reasserted itself as a concern because Saudi Arabia produces roughly 10% of the world's crude oil. 
The Trump Administration blamed the attack on Iran. The Iranians denied the charge. Combatants in Yemen, engaged in a war with the Saudis, claimed responsibility.

DETROIT (Reuters) - Negotiators for General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) and the United Auto Workers were continuing talks Monday afternoon to resolve a strike that shut down the automaker's highly profitable U.S. operations. 
The UAW on Sunday launched the first company-wide strike at GM in 12 years, saying negotiations toward a new national agreement covering about 48,000 hourly workers had hit an impasse.
Workers took to picket lines outside GM factories, waving signs declaring ""UAW On Strike."" During the walkout, UAW members will get $250 a week from the union's strike fund.
The UAW confirmed Monday morning that talks had resumed and GM said the talks were continuing more than five hours later. Lost production could cost GM up to $50 million a day in pretax profit, RBC Capital Markets estimated in a note Monday. GM could make up the lost production with overtime work after a settlement.
Moody's Investors Service said in a note Monday the critical issue is whether GM will ""secure the operating flexibility necessary"" to address challenges including higher hourly costs than foreign automakers, a potential severe downturn in U.S. auto sales and the need for automakers ""to begin transitioning to the production of more electric vehicles that will likely require fewer workers to assemble.""
Company and union officials say there are a number of issues to be resolved and that no immediate resolution on Monday is expected. 
Contract talks with GM have been overshadowed by a mushrooming U.S. federal corruption probe into top union officials. The investigation has raised questions about UAW president Gary Jones, who a source said was an unnamed official cited in a searing federal complaint last week detailing alleged embezzlement by union leaders.
The strike quickly became a political issue, as both U.S. President Donald Trump and Democrats who want to unseat him in 2020 weighed in. Trump and Democrats see the votes of UAW members in the Midwest as critical to victory.
Trump on Monday told reporters he hoped the strike was a short one after taking to Twitter to urge the UAW and GM to ""get together and make a deal!"" GM spokesman Tony Cervone said the automaker ""couldn't agree more"" with Trump's call. 
GM Chief Executive Mary Barra met with Trump ahead of the strike deadline. Trump has attacked GM for Barra's decision to stop building small cars at an assembly plant in Lordstown, Ohio. The state is pivotal to Trump's re-election.
The union wants to stop GM from closing Lordstown and an assembly plant in Detroit. The UAW has said workers deserve higher pay after years of record profits for GM in North America. 
GM argues the plant shutdowns are necessary responses to market shifts, and that UAW wages and benefits are expensive compared with competing non-union auto plants in southern U.S. states.
GM initially insisted the UAW dramatically boost its share of healthcare costs but largely dropped that demand, union and company officials said.
In a statement Sunday, GM outlined its offer to the union, saying the package included solutions for the Michigan and Ohio assembly plants currently lacking products, $7 billion in U.S. investment and a signing bonus of $8,000 per worker.
A person familiar with GM's offer said the company could produce a future electric pickup truck at the Detroit-Hamtramck plant that now has no future assignment. 
GM could also build an electric vehicle battery plant in Lordstown, and go through with the proposed sale of the plant to a group affiliated with electric vehicle start-up Workhorse Group Inc.
A new battery plant could give some UAW workers at Lordstown the chance to remain with GM.
The UAW’s top negotiator at GM said the company's proposal came just two hours before the strike deadline, and laid blame for the strike on the automaker. 
“Had we received this proposal earlier in the process, it may have been possible to reach a tentative agreement and avoid a strike,” UAW Vice President Terry Dittes wrote in a letter to GM on Sunday, according to a copy viewed by Reuters. 
GM shares closed down 4.3% on Monday. 
ECONOMY COULD FEEL IMPACT
A strike will very quickly shut down GM's operations across North America and could hurt the broader U.S. economy. Prolonged industrial action would also cause hardship for GM hourly workers on greatly reduced strike pay. Suppliers of parts and services to GM's U.S. operations could also suffer from a long shutdown, as could dealers and consumers.
GM's workers last went out on a brief two-day strike in 2007 during contract talks. A more painful strike occurred in Flint, Michigan, in 1998, lasting 54 days and costing the No. 1 U.S. automaker more than $2 billion. 
The UAW has framed the plant closures as a betrayal of workers who made concessions in 2009 to help GM through its government-led bankruptcy.
Some of those concessions are now matters of disagreement. The union wants to limit GM's use of temporary workers in its plants, and narrow the pay gap between new hires and veteran workers. 
The strike will test both the union and GM at a time when the U.S. auto industry is facing slowing sales and rising costs associated with launching electric vehicles and curbing emissions.
The impact of the strike on dealers and car shoppers will be delayed. GM started off the strike with healthy levels of inventory of some its key, high-margin vehicles. 

A prolonged strike could delay the planned introduction next spring of GM’s redesigned full-size SUVs in Arlington, Texas. Among the company’s most profitable vehicles, they include the Cadillac Escalade, the GMC Yukon and the Chevrolet Tahoe and Suburban.

(Reuters) - Lawyers for cities and counties suing drug companies over the opioid epidemic on Monday objected to a bid by pharmaceutical distributors and pharmacies to disqualify the federal judge overseeing the cases, saying it had no basis and came too late.
The plaintiffs' lawyers moved swiftly to fight the request companies including AmerisourceBergen Corp (N:ABC),  Cardinal Health  Inc (N:CAH) and McKesson Corp (N:MCK) had made on Saturday for U.S. District Judge Dan Polster in Cleveland, Ohio, to step aside from the litigation.
In Monday's brief, lawyers for the plaintiffs said the defendants had waived their ability to seek Polster's recusal, noting they were relying on statements he made more than a year ago to belatedly seek his disqualification.
""If these Defendants really thought recusal was necessary, they were required to raise the issue sooner - much sooner,"" the plaintiffs' lawyers wrote.
More than 2,500 lawsuits by state and local governments are pending nationally, accusing drug manufacturers of deceptively marketing opioids in ways that downplayed their risks, and drug distributors of failing to detect and halt suspicious orders.
The companies deny wrongdoing. Nearly 2,100 of the lawsuits are before Polster, while others are in state courts.
The companies had argued in Saturday's motion that Polster, who has long pushed for a settlement that could ""do something meaningful to abate this crisis,"" had made a series of public statements since 2018 that could cause a reasonable person to question his impartiality.
They said those statements, made in court hearings and media interviews, raised the prospect that he had improperly prejudged their liability ahead of the first trial on Oct. 21 involving two Ohio counties seeking $8 billion.
In Monday's brief, the plaintiffs' lawyers said the companies did not take action when Polster made those comments and actively participated in court-overseen settlement talks without objection.
Polster ""has at no time expressed improper or biased views about the liability of any defendant, much less views based on extra-judicial sources,"" the lawyers wrote.
The companies who joined Saturday's motion also include CVS Health Corp (N:CVS) and Walmart Inc (N:WMT). The defendants did not respond to requests for comment.
Opioids were involved in 400,000 overdose deaths from 1999 to 2017, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma, one of the lead defendants, filed for bankruptcy protection on Monday after reaching a tentative deal to resolve claims in the federal litigation and by 24 U.S. states."

Congressman Raul Grijalva, a Democrat who chairs the House Natural Resources Committee, is seeking to move the board's funding from the bankrupt U.S. commonwealth to the U.S. government, as well as to define essential services and order an audit of the island's debt as part of the PROMESA Act, according to Margarita Varela-Rosa, a staff member in the committee's Office of Insular Affairs.
The committee, which oversees U.S. territories, will discuss a draft of the proposed amendments on Oct. 22, she said.
Besides creating a seven-member oversight board, the act also allowed Puerto Rico to file a form of bankruptcy in 2017 to restructure about $120 billion of debt and pension obligations.
The board and the bankruptcy have both been controversial in Puerto Rico, where former Governor Ricardo Rossello battled with the board over spending priorities and potential pension cuts.
Varela-Rosa said one proposed amendment would designate pensions, along with education, healthcare and public safety as essential services. As for funding, the board's fiscal 2019 budget totaled $64.75 million.
Rossello, who resigned from office last month, was eventually replaced by Wanda Vazquez, who met with Grijalva at her San Juan office on Monday.
Grijalva also wants to legislatively address reconstruction efforts on the island in the wake of massive destruction caused by Hurricane Maria in 2017, according to Varela-Rosa. After hearing from residents during his latest trip to Puerto Rico, Grijalva is considering community-based oversight of federal and local efforts, she added."

The New York-based power company said in a statement on Monday that the Affordable Clean Energy (ACE) rule undermines efforts already under way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by investing in renewable energy, electric vehicle infrastructure and energy efficiency and other clean technologies.
The group of utilities, which calls itself the Power Companies Climate Coalition, have already invested heavily in adopting those technologies because their state governments passed laws requiring them to adopt large amounts of renewable energy such as wind and solar.
In addition to Con Ed, the coalition comprises  Exelon Corp  (N:EXC),  National Grid  (L:NG), PG&E Corp (N:PCG), Public Service Enterprise Group Inc (N:PEG), Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, Seattle City Light, Sacramento Municipal Utility District and New York Power Authority. Together, they serve over 23 million customers in 49 states.
A similar suit was filed by Democratic-led states and cities in August.
The utility group's petition was filed in the District of Columbia Circuit Court of Appeals on Sept. 6 but was not widely reported at the time.
In a statement released on the day it filed the petition, the coalition said the Environmental Protection Agency's ACE rule ""fails to acknowledge the ways in which they and others within the power sector have already reduced their carbon emissions while maintaining reliability.""
The rule, finalized in June of this year, is aimed at helping coal companies facing tough competition from renewable energy suppliers. It gives states three years to devise their own plans to cut emissions mainly by encouraging coal-fired power plants to improve efficiency.
Obama's Clean Power Plan aimed to slash power plant carbon emissions by more than a third from 2005 levels by 2030 by pushing utilities to drop coal. That regulation was never enacted because of lawsuits by Republican-led states."

Apache (NYSE:APA), one of the largest independent U.S. oil-and-gas producers, was up more than 15% Monday afternoon and is up 30% so far in September.
The gain has put the stock back in the black for 2019. As of Friday's close, the shares were off 7.3% for the year. Now, Houston-based Apache (NYSE:APA) is up about 7%.
Energy shares had a great first quarter as Saudi Arabia pushed a campaign to get major oil-producing countries to cut output to boost prices. But the prices – and the stocks -- slumped in the second quarter and into the third quarter because of the U.S.-China trade battle. 
The situation reversed itself after Saturday's drone attacks on the state-run Saudi Arabian Oil Co.’s (Aramco) Abqaiq plant – a key crude processing facility – and the Khurais complex, which houses the kingdom’s second-largest oilfield.
West Texas Intermediate crude was up 14.3% at $62.68 a barrel.
 Apache's outsized gain was due in part because its exposure in the Middle East is limited to production in Egypt, and the company had already been telling investors it will be boosting its Permian Basin production in Texas by a third in the fourth quarter to around 100,000 barrels of oil (and equivalents) per day.
Also, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) analysts rated Apache (NYSE:APA) among companies with ""the greatest 4Q19 potential operating cash flow percentage uplift."" Others included Hess (NYSE:HES), Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) and   Cimarex Energy   (NYSE:XEC).
Energy shares were among the few stock-market sectors showing gains.   Chevron   (NYSE:CVX) and   Exxon Mobil   (NYSE:XOM), up 2.6% and 2.2% respectively, were the top performers among the 30 Dow stocks. The Dow Industrials were off 0.47%.
Saudi Arabia produces about 10% of the world’s oil. The disruption could slash Saudi Arabia’s daily oil exports of 7.4 million barrels by as much as three-quarters. The New York Times said Monday the attacks could take roughly 5% of global supplies off the market, unless the Abqaiq facility in particular is quickly repaired."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - What banks and Wall Street dealers pay for overnight cash in the repurchase agreement market surged on Monday to the most expensive levels since early 2019 as the cash for lending fell due to payments on corporate taxes and the supply of Treasuries.
The overnight rate in the repurchase agreement (repo) market jumped to 4.10% from 2.29% late on Friday. That was the highest level since 6.5% recorded on Jan. 2.
""The amount was way higher than anyone had expected,"" said Tom Simons, senior money market strategist at Jefferies LLC.
Last week, the Treasury Department sold $78 billion in three-year, 10-year and 30-year debt securities, which are scheduled to settle on Monday.
Quarterly federal tax payments for U.S. companies are due on Monday.
On Friday, money market funds experienced $20.4 billion in outflows prior to the deadline on corporate tax payments and settlement on coupon-bearing Treasuries, according to Crane Data.
Peter Crane, president of Crane Data, said it is not usual to see this type of outflows from money funds ahead of quarterly tax payments.
Meanwhile, the surge in repo rates likely curbed bidding at the auctions of $45 billion in three-month Treasury bills (US3MT=RR) and $42 billion in six-month bills (US6MT=RR) on Monday due to higher borrowing costs for dealers, Jefferies' Simons said.
""To an extent, the bill auctions suffered because dealers weren't bidding for them,"" he said.
The bid-to-cover ratio, a measure of overall auction demand, at the three-month T-bill sale fell to its lowest in a month, resulting in an interest rate at the highest in three weeks.
The bid-to-cover ratio at the six-month auction was the lowest since Aug. 5 with its interest rate reaching the highest in six weeks.
Repo rates should retreat later this week on monthly interest payments from mortgage-backed securities to investors and a possible rate decrease from the Federal Reserve, Simons said.

PARIS/BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Shares in Airbus and French luxury goods exporters fell on Monday as the European Union acknowledged it may face U.S. tariffs in a long-running dispute over aircraft subsidies, part of an escalating tit-for-tat trade row.
The World Trade Organization has approved a U.S. request to impose tariffs on European goods in the latest chapter of a dispute over aircraft subsidies that could lead to European reprisals, two people familiar with the case said. 
The scope of the decision, which had been widely anticipated, is due to be announced in the week of Sept 30.
The EU's trade chief said the United States was likely to impose tariffs ""quite soon"".
The WTO has found that both Airbus and its U.S. rival Boeing (NYSE:BA) received billions of dollars of harmful subsidies in a pair of cases marking the world's largest ever corporate trade dispute.
The EU and United States are now drawing up potential tariffs after the Geneva body also found neither side had adhered fully to its findings. But Washington is first in line to turn this into actual tariffs because its case is running nine months ahead.
Washington has sought permission to impose tariffs up to 100% on European goods worth $11.2 billion a year. These include aircraft and aerospace parts from Airbus host nations - Britain, France, Germany and Spain - as well a range of goods including wine, cheese and luxury goods from across the EU.
Exports of Airbus commercial helicopters could also be hit.
The final amount will depend on WTO arbitrators who presented their findings internally last week.
Washington must then draw from a broader list of EU products with a trade value of $25 billion a year that it has tapped for possible inclusion in the final list of any punitive tariffs.
Airbus jets and parts are likely to be hit first, whatever the size of the approved countermeasures, trade sources said.
Shares in Airbus, which relies on a flow of parts to feed an assembly line in Alabama, and which also counts U.S. airlines among its major customers for aircraft assembled at its main plants in Europe, fell 3.2%.
Luxury goods group LVMH - whose products include Louis Vuitton handbags, Moet et Chandon champagne and Hennessy cognac - fell 3.5%. The United States represents just under a quarter of group revenue.
 Hermes International  (PA:HRMS) fell 1.5%.
Airbus Chief Executive Guillaume Faury said in an interview published on Monday that the planemaker would not see a big impact in 2019 but could not rule out disruption.
SHIFTING BLAME
The potential exchange of tariffs stems from complaints filed well before the current spate of global trade tensions, but is coming to a head just as global markets are taking fright at trade friction dominated by a U.S.-China trade war.
On the transatlantic front, tensions have been brewing since the U.S. imposed steel and aluminum tariffs last year, while the United States has also threatened to impose car tariffs.
Both sides in the aircraft dispute have attempted to deflect blame for any further escalation by accusing the other of ignoring attempts to head off a trade war through negotiation.
In June, two U.S. sources told Reuters the United States would likely be open to talks on an enforceable mechanism allowing Airbus to receive government funding on commercial terms while addressing disputed Washington-state tax breaks for Boeing.
U.S. officials later said the EU had failed to show any interest in talks.
The EU, however, said on Monday it was Washington that stood in the way of a negotiated settlement.
Trade chief Cecilia Malmstrom said the EU had asked the United States in July to hold off trade sanctions and seek an agreement.
""Our view is that we have enough tariffs in the world as it is ... The U.S. president likes to make deals so we have offered to try to make a deal to find a negotiated solution,"" EU Trade Commissioner Malmstrom told a briefing.
""So far, unfortunately, the U.S. has not said that they are willing to negotiate, at least not until they have imposed their tariffs, which they are likely to do quite soon,"" she said. 
The EU trade chief said any EU-U.S. agreement could serve as a template for others to follow to create a level playing field. 
""We also know other big players in the world, such as Russia and China but also others, are also subsidizing their civil aircraft industry,"" she said.

Western officials who have tried to explore a compromise in the past believe any new funding agreement must set an example for China, whose own rapid aerospace growth with state backing is viewed as a worrying threat by the two Western plane giants.

ATHENS (Reuters) - Greece is in talks with Canada's Eldorado Gold Corp to secure higher royalties from its mining development projects and new jobs, Energy Minister Kostis Hatzidakis said on Monday.
Vancouver-based miner Eldorado has two operating mines and two development projects in northern Greece and its planned investment is viewed as one of the biggest in the country in years.
The projects have, however, repeatedly stalled over licensing delays and environmental concerns.
They have become flagship schemes for Greece's new conservative government, which took office in July with a pledge to unblock foreign investments and help boost economic output crimped by a quarter through years of financial turmoil.
Early this month, the government issued installation permits for Eldorado's Skouries project.
""We want to move ahead with a contract which, on the one hand, will send a business-friendly message, and on the other hand, a contract that will secure more jobs, more royalties and clear environmental protection for the region in line with European standards,"" Hatzidakis told Reuters.
""There are negotiations right now. What we have told Eldorado Gold is that we don't want these negotiations to slow down, but it also depends on the proposals they will present. We cannot reach an agreement at any expense.""
One standoff between the previous leftist-led administration and Eldorado was over the company's plan to build a metallurgical plant to process ores mined in Skouries. The government had said that plan was deficient.
Eldorado is open to revisiting royalty rates in the country, Chief Executive George Burns said on Monday at an industry conference in Denver, Colorado. 
""The royalty scheme in Greece, I would say, is modestly in the middle of the range worldwide for countries, so we are open to discussions about that,"" he said in an interview.
He said the company is awaiting a permit for its dry-stack tailings and a separate approval for relocating antiquities at the project site. 
Eldorado will seek a strategic partner to help fund the remaining $680 million in development costs at Skouries while retaining the role of project operator, Burns said.
New Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis has said that the government could revise the contract to possibly include a new investment by Eldorado in another Greek region.
GAS UTILITY SALE
Mitsotakis has also been keen to speed up privatizations in the energy sector, including natural gas utility DEPA, which is 65% state-owned.
The previous government passed legislation that split DEPA operations, with the aim to sell a 50.1% stake in its commercial business and a minority stake in its distribution networks across Greece.
Hatzidakis said he would soon amend that law to allow for the sale of majority stakes both in DEPA's retail operations and its distribution grid.
""We have indications that there will be strong (investor) interest.""
Hatzidakis, 54, a former European Union parliament member, has been tasked to work on a rescue plan for state-owned Public Power Corp (PPC) which has been struggling with 2.7 billion euros ($2.99 billion) of unpaid bills from customers unable to pay during the country's financial crisis. 
Authorities increased electricity rates and reduced discounts offered to customers who paid on time in September in an attempt to plug a cash shortfall estimated at more than 900 million euros.
Hatzidakis also pledged that the state would settle subsidies owed to PPC in return for providing cheap electricity to vulnerable customers and remote islands. 
""It's about 200 million euros and will be paid in the coming months,"" he said.
Under its post-bailout commitment with its international lenders, Greece has agreed that PPC will sell power to its peers at below-cost prices to help open up the sector via the so-called NOME auctions. Hatzidakis says this has cost the utility about 600 million euros and the NOME auctions would be scrapped.
The government has been discussing with its lenders alternative structural measures for PPC and the energy market, which included the gradual decommissioning of coal-fired plants and the partial privatization of the power distribution grid, Hatzidakis said. 
""NOME will be scrapped and the auction which is scheduled for October will not take place,"" he said.

""The government needs to have finalised structural measures for the energy market and PPC by the end of October, mid-November.""

The company last week unveiled three iPhone models featuring upgraded processors and new camera functionality, including iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro and iPhone 11 Pro Max, priced between $699 and $1,099.
CNBC quoted TF International Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, known as a close follower of the Cupertino, California-based company's supply chains, as saying that demand for new iPhones is beating his expectations – and that much of it was due to Chinese consumers.
Greater China was the third biggest region in terms of sales in 2018 and after raising alarms after slack sales growth earlier this year, Apple has seen bumps in demand driven by discounting by Chinese online retailers.
Chinese e-commerce site JD.com on Saturday said on its official Weibo account that day one pre-sales for the iPhone 11 series jumped 480% versus the previous year, with the top three most popular products being the iPhone 11 Pro in midnight green, and the standard iPhone 11 in black and purple.
Chinese media outlet Yicai also said on Monday that they jumped 335% on Alibaba's Tmall platform on the first day of sales vs pre-sales for the iPhone XR last year, citing Tmall figures.
CNBC said that Kuo had boosted his forecast for iPhone 11 series shipments from between 65 million and 70 million units in 2019 to between 70 million and 75 million units.
While giving numbers that did not compare directly with Kuo's, analysts at two other brokerages also said that the initial orders were looking good.
Instinet, owned by Japanese bank Nomura, cited ""shipment"" checks for its conclusions, while Wedbush's Daniel Ives said he had conducted supplier checks throughout Asia including China.
""We are careful about extrapolating first weekend
data, though it is fair to say it is ahead of last year's launches,"" Instinet analysts wrote in a note.
""Should the early shipment time data hold and translate to unit volumes, Apple may be able to offset this year's average selling price reduction,"" they added.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Greg Ulmer, head of  Lockheed Martin  Corp's (N:LMT) F-35 fighter program, will temporarily lead the company's aeronautics division while its current chief, Michele Evans, undergoes treatment for a ""significant"" medical issue, Evans told employees on Monday.
Evans, 54, who took over as executive vice president of Lockheed's largest division in October 2018, is widely seen as a leading candidate to succeed Marillyn Hewson, 65, as chief executive of Lockheed, the No. 1 U.S. arms maker.
The surprise announcement about Evans' illness came at the start of the high-profile annual Air Force Association conference in Washington, and could raise questions about Lockheed's succession planning.
Evans was diagnosed with cancer several months ago but has continued to work while undergoing treatment, according to three sources familiar with the situation. 
Evans gave no details, but told employees about what she called ""a significant medical issue"" in a letter on Monday.
""While it's certainly been an unexpected shock for me and my family, the prognosis is excellent and the condition is curable,"" she wrote in the memo, a copy of which was viewed by Reuters.
She said she would remain engaged as much as possible, but Ulmer would serve as her delegate and acting executive vice president of the aeronautics division through late November, while she focused on her recovery.
Lockheed spokesman Joe LaMarca said the medical issue was discovered during Evans' annual executive physical and follow-up with medical personnel.
""Her prognosis is excellent, the condition is treatable, and a full recovery is expected,"" he said.
""Evans has been viewed as the leading internal candidate to succeed Marillyn Hewson, so people inside and outside the company will be following this story closely,"" said Loren Thompson, a defense consultant with close ties to Lockheed.
Evans worked at multiple positions across Lockheed throughout her 32 years in the weapons industry, and plays a leading role in the company's diversity initiatives.
Industry insiders and analysts say she is among the top candidates to succeed Hewson, given her age, strategic vision and broad range of experience across the company.
Lockheed last year changed its mandatory retirement age rules to exempt the CEO, allowing Hewson to stay on past this year. It has not named a chief operating officer to start the process of choosing a successor to Hewson, who last year topped Fortune magazine's U.S. list of most powerful women.
Aeronautics, the largest of the company's four divisions, reported a 15% increase in revenues to $11.13 billion in the first half of 2019, with operating profit up 13% to $1.18 billion in the same period.

With about 25,000 employees, Lockheed's aeronautics division builds the F-35 stealth fighter, the C-130J transport plane, and a variety of other military aircraft. It also includes the company's famed Skunk Works advanced development unit.

102,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 16, 2019 12:07PM ET</span>",GM's UAW workers to go on nationwide strike for first time in 12 years,"By Nick Carey and Ben Klayman
DETROIT (Reuters) - The United Auto Workers (UAW) said on Sunday that its roughly 48,000 hourly workers at General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) facilities would go on strike as of midnight Sunday after U.S. labor contract talks reached an impasse, the first nationwide strike at GM in 12 years.
""We do not take this lightly,"" Terry Dittes, the UAW vice president in charge of the union's relationship with GM, said at a press conference in downtown Detroit. ""This is our last resort.""
GM said in a statement that its offer to the UAW during talks included more than $7 billion in investments, 5,400 jobs - a majority of which would be new jobs - pay increases, improved benefits and a contract ratification bonus of $8,000.
""We have negotiated in good faith and with a sense of urgency,"" the automaker said.
Earlier on Sunday 850 maintenance workers at five GM facilities went on strike.
The union has been fighting to stop GM from closing auto assembly plants in Ohio and Michigan and arguing workers deserve higher pay after years of record profits for GM in North America.
GM argues the plant shutdowns are necessary responses to market shifts, and that UAW wages and benefits are expensive compared with competing non-union auto plants in southern U.S. states. In its statement, the automaker said its offer to the union included solutions for the Michigan and Ohio assembly plants that currently lack products.
Before the union's previous four-year contract with the No. 1 U.S. automaker expired at 11:59 p.m. local time on Saturday, Dittes said that ""significant differences"" remained between the two sides over wages, health care benefits, temporary employees, job security and profit sharing.
The union has framed the plant closures as a betrayal of workers who made concessions in 2009 to help the automaker through its government-led bankruptcy.
""General Motors needs to understand that we stood up for GM when they needed us,"" Ted Krumm, head of the union's bargaining committee in talks with GM, said at the press conference Sunday. These are profitable times... and we deserve a fair contract. We helped make this company what it is.""
The strike will test both the union and GM Chief Executive Mary Barra at a time when the U.S. auto industry is facing slowing sales and rising costs for launching electric vehicles and curbing emissions.
Kristin Dziczek, vice president of industry, labor and economics at the Ann Arbor, Michigan-based Center for Automotive Research (CAR), said the strike at GM's U.S. facilities will also shut its plants in Canada and Mexico because the automaker's supply chain is so integrated.
""That's going to have a big effect on the economy,"" she said.
GM starts off the strike with healthy levels of inventory of some its key, high-margin vehicles.
As of Sept. 1, the automaker had 96 days supply of its Chevrolet Silverado pickup truck, 59 days supply of its Chevrolet Equinox SUV and more than 100 days supply of the Cadillac Escalade.
If the strike is short, hourly workers should not suffer much. But strike pay provided by the UAW, which has been building up reserves in preparation for possible industrial action, is just $250 per week.
This is far below their normal wages and means that the longer the strike goes on, the harder it will be for GM's workers to pay their bills.
""The pain is deep on both sides,"" CAR's Dziczek said. ""(GM) will start to see costs immediately, but the costs (will) become prohibitive and drive them back to the table after a couple of weeks.""
GM's workers last went out on a brief two-day strike in 2007 during contract talks. A more painful strike occurred in Flint, Michigan, in 1998, lasting 54 days and costing the No. 1 U.S. automaker more than $2 billion.
Earlier on Sunday, the UAW said maintenance workers employed by GM contractor Aramark would strike at five GM plants in Michigan and Ohio.
The automaker has 12 vehicle assembly plants, 12 engine and power train facilities and a handful of stamping plants and other facilities around the United States.
The UAW said the Aramark workers have been in negotiations since March 2018, and the company and union are at odds over pay and benefits.
UAW spokesman Brian Rothenberg did not say whether talks have resumed.
On Friday, the UAW announced temporary contract extensions with Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCA) while it focused its attention on GM. The union had targeted GM as the first automaker with which it wanted to conclude contract talks.
This year's talks had been expected to be contentious but have been complicated by recent developments in a longstanding federal investigation into corruption at the union."
103,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 16, 2019 11:54AM ET</span>",Auto Union Digs In for GM Strike Over Pay and Benefits ,"(Bloomberg) -- The United Auto Workers union is leading its first strike against General Motors Co (NYSE:GM). in 12 years, digging in for a fight over jobs and benefits that could cost the carmaker dearly for an indefinite period.
The strike that took effect at midnight may cost GM about $50 million a day in earnings before interest and taxes due to lost production, Dan Levy, an analyst at  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN), said Sunday. The shares fell 3.2% in pre-market trading on Monday.
While GM touted an offer to invest in plants across the U.S. and boost wages and benefits, UAW leadership has been rocked by a corruption scandal and needs to show willingness to bring the fight to an automaker that’s been scaling back its workforce.
“The union is playing some hardball. It seems they are pretty far apart,” said Kristin Dziczek, vice president of the labor and economics group at the Center for Automotive Research. GM’s offer “still doesn’t address some of the union’s demands.”
GM has offered $7 billion of investment in eight U.S. plants and more than 5,400 additional jobs, most of which would be new hires. But the union said GM’s proposal fell short in key areas including health care, use of temporary workers and the length of time it takes for shorter-tenured members to get to top-scale pay.
The union is seeking pay raises for entry-level workers, who currently start at less than $20 an hour, and to get them to the peak wage of almost $30 an hour in three or four years, instead of the current period of eight years.
“Going into this bargaining season, our members have been very clear about what they will and will not accept from this contract,” UAW Vice President Terry Dittes said at a press conference on Sunday. “We are standing up for fair wages, we are standing up for affordable, quality health care. We are standing up for our share of the profits. We are standing up for job security for our members.”
Temporary employees and those working their way up the pay scale are doing the same work for less compensation, said Ted Krumm, the head of the union’s bargaining committee. “We are fighting for the future of the middle class,” he said.
GM’s Offer
GM countered that it made the union a generous offer to invest in factories in four states, including a new vehicle in the Detroit-Hamtramck sedan plant that had been slated to end production in January.
In Lordstown, Ohio, where GM has idled the factory that once had three shifts of workers making Chevrolet Cruze compact cars, the automaker plans to set up the first union-represented electric-car battery plant in the U.S. There are also four electric trucks coming that other UAW plants will build.
GM offered workers a signing bonus of $8,000 per member if they ratify the deal, plus wage gains or lump-sum payments in all four years of the contract. The carmaker says it’s offering to keep members’ health-care contributions the same as in the current contract.
“What GM is doing is highly unusual,” said Harley Shaiken, labor professor at the University of California at Berkeley. “It’s going over the head of the UAW leadership and seeking to address the members and the public more generally. That is a highly risky strategy. It tends to galvanize the membership in support of the leadership and complicates an already tough situation.”
Implicated President
Before the two sides held talks over the weekend, the UAW was distracted by federal corruption charges against leaders in a scandal implicating the union’s president, Gary Jones. While the UAW’s executive board met on Friday and discussed whether to remove him from the role, he has kept his job, a union spokesman said.
Jones didn’t attend the press conference but was quoted in the union’s statement that called the strike.
“We told UAW GM members that we would stand up for them and their future,” Jones said in the statement.
The walkout will be just the second national work stoppage at GM since a 67-day strike in 1970. GM did have a 54-day strike at a key plant in Flint, Michigan, in 1998 that effectively shut down most of its assembly plants.
The impact of the latest strike on the U.S. economy will be negligible compared with 49 years ago, when the 400,000 workers GM employed at the time represented about 1.2% of the national payroll. The automaker now has about one-tenth the number of union-represented U.S. employees.
Any deal the UAW reaches with GM would set a precedent for the jobs, wages, benefits that the union demands from Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co. and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV. The union hasn’t said which carmaker it will target next for bargaining over a new contract.
GM has been under attack by President Donald Trump for shrinking its U.S. workforce and idling plants in the key electoral battleground states of Michigan and Ohio. On Sunday, he sent a tweet calling for the carmaker and union to “make a deal.”"

The move follows Fitch Ratings' downgrade earlier this month on Hong Kong's long-term foreign-currency-issuer default rating to ""AA"" from ""AA+"".
""Moody's has previously noted that a downgrade could be triggered by a shift in the current equilibrium between the SAR's (Special Administrative Region's) economic proximity to and legal and regulatory distance from China,"" Moody's said in a statement.
""The decision to change Hong Kong's outlook to negative signals rising concern that this shift is happening, notwithstanding recent moves by Hong Kong's government to accommodate some of the demonstrators' demands.""
Hong Kong's financial secretary Paul Chan said the city's government disagrees with Moody's assessment and that the inference is ""not founded on facts"".
""In spite of the concern over the recent social incidents, Hong Kong's financial markets and its banking system have been functioning normally in the past few months. The Linked Exchange Rate System has been operating smoothly. Banks remain well capitalized with ample liquidity,"" he said in a statement.
The institutional features that grant Hong Kong greater political and economic autonomy — together with the city's intrinsic credit strengths — accounted for Hong Kong's higher rating than China, the agency said.
On Sunday, what began as a mostly peaceful protest descended into violence in some of the Chinese territory's busiest shopping and tourist districts. The demonstrations were the latest in over three months of sometimes violent protests.
Hong Kong's leader, Carrie Lam, told a group of businessmen in late August that her ""political room for maneuvering is very, very, very limited"", because the unrest has become a national security and sovereignty issue for China.
The longer the standoff continues, the greater the risk that Hong Kong's attractiveness as a global economic and financial center would be diminished, Moody's said. Dwindling capacity for the government to implement certain policies could ""undermine key drivers of its competitiveness and macroeconomic stability"".
Moody's affirmed HK's Aa2 rating, however, citing ""strong fiscal and external buffers, with a minimal government debt burden, large fiscal reserves and ample foreign exchange reserves"".
It said it would ""likely downgrade Hong Kong's rating"" if it concluded the protests, or measures taken by the Hong Kong government to resolve them, were likely to damage Hong Kong's medium-term economic prospects, or ""signify an erosion in the predictability and effectiveness of its governing, judicial and policymaking institutions"".
Gary Ng, an economist at Natixis in Hong Kong, said the rating action by the rating agencies was an early indicator and warning signal.
""I don't think there will be aggressive markets in the short run. The impact will come in the medium term. Some quasi-government agencies may need to pay higher funding costs should the third credit rating agency (S&P) downgrade Hong Kong.""
The Hong Kong dollar was little changed at 7.8201 per U.S. dollar. The currency is pegged to the dollar at a tight range of 7.75-7.85."

The company is expected to move forward with presentations to analysts and meetings with bankers as planned. However, Saudi energy officials and Aramco executives are debating a rescheduling of the IPO until after the company fully restores its production to normal levels.
Discussions of a change in the offering's timing have been confined to Saudi officials and Aramco executives, the report said.
Yemen's Houthi Group on Saturday claimed responsibility for the drone attacks on two Aramco's plants.
Aramco had planned to list 1% shares of the state oil plant on the Riyadh stock exchange before the end of this year and another 1% in 2020, Reuters reported last week.
Based on the indicated $2 trillion valuation that Saudi Aramco had hoped to achieve, a 1% float would be worth $20 billion.

""Our view is that we have enough tariffs in the world as it is... The U.S. president likes to make deals so we have offered to try to make a deal to find a negotiated solution,"" EU Trade Commissioner Malmstrom told a briefing.
The EU presented a proposal in July to discuss issues raised by the cases, including aid for program development, repayable launch investment and tax subsidies.
""So far, unfortunately, the U.S. has not said that they are willing to negotiate, at least not until they have imposed their tariffs, which they are likely to do quite soon,"" Malmstrom said.
The EU trade chief said any EU-U.S. agreement could serve as a template for others to follow to create a level playing field.
""We also know other big players in the world, such as Russia and China but also others, are also subsidizing their civil aircraft industry,"" she said.
The European Union has drawn up a list of U.S. imports, including aircraft, chemicals and food, worth $20 billion in readiness for a WTO decision likely to be early next year in the Boeing subsidy case.
Malmstrom expressed hope that the bloc would not have to use it."

MILAN (Reuters) - Oil prices hit four-month highs on Monday after attacks on crude facilities in Saudi Arabia fueled worries over the impact of an oil shock on economic growth, halting a positive run in world stocks and bolstering demand for safe-haven assets. 
Brent crude futures rose nearly 20% at one point in their biggest intra-day gain since the Gulf War in 1991, and U.S. futures jumped almost 16%, both hitting their highest level since May. But prices came off their peaks after U.S. President Donald Trump authorized the use of the country's emergency stockpile to ensure stable supply. 
By 1126 GMT, Brent futures were up 10% at $66.33 per barrel, while U.S. light crude was up 9.5% at $60.27.
The upheaval in the oil market and poor economic data from China pushed gold prices, the Japanese yen and Swiss franc higher and sent core euro zone bond yields lower, even though the broader fallout on markets was not dramatic.
""While the attacks present yet another headwind for a global economy that is already buffeted by deteriorating manufacturing activity and elevated trade tensions, we don't believe that this short-term disruption to oil production will trigger a global recession,"" said Mark Haefele, CIO at UBS Global Wealth Management.
""On the back of geopolitical and market uncertainties, thematic gold exposure is still advised alongside countercyclical positions such as Japanese yen longs,"" he added.
World stocks halted a four day winning streak to trade slightly lower, down 0.15% on the day. European shares fell 0.4% and Wall Street signaled a weak start, too, with futures for the S&P 500 off 0.4%. 
Monday's rapid spike in crude prices came at a time when central banks in the United States, Europe and Asia are easing monetary policy to fight a slowdown in the global economy amid a drawn-out trade war between Washington and Beijing. 
The U.S. Federal Reserve is due to hold its next policy meeting on Wednesday, at which it is widely expected to ease interest rates and signal its future policy path. 
Expectations of monetary policy stimulus have been helping offset immediate concerns over the economy, supporting equity prices. World stocks are trading just around 2% below the all-time peak they hit in January 2018.
Data from China earlier on Monday underscored a slowdown in the world's No. 2 economy, although that bolstered hopes of more stimulus policies from Beijing to underpin the economy. 
Industrial production in China grew at its weakest pace in 17-1/2 years, the data showed, amid rising U.S. trade pressure and softening domestic demand.
Citi strategist Dirk Willer said the impact of a sustained rise in oil prices would be more pronounced for Europe and China than for the United States, which is now a net crude exporter, even though U.S. consumers would be hit. 
""The U.S. may still be a relative winner. The size of the shock obviously will depend on how much oil is taken off the market,"" he said.
The weekend attack at Saudi Aramco's facilities shut down about 5% of the world's supply and while the company had not given a timeline for the resumption of full output, sources said a return to normal volumes ""may take months"".
GOLD SHINES, SAUDI BONDS HIT 
Trump also said on Sunday the United States was ""locked and loaded"" for a potential response to the attack on Saudi Arabia's oil facilities, after a senior U.S. administration official said Iran was to blame.
That inflamed fears about Middle East tensions and worsening relations between Teheran and Washington, powering safe-haven assets, with gold up 1% to $1,504 per ounce. 
Dollar-denominated bonds issued by Saudi Arabia's government and state-oil firm Saudi Aramco tumbled to multi-week following the attacks. 
""Markets had become too sanguine over the last few months about the geopolitical risks facing countries allied with the U.S. against Iran, with Saudi Arabia particularly vulnerable,"" said Patrick Wacker at UOB Asset Management. 
""While Saudi Arabia's sovereign fundamentals are still firm, bond prices will need to factor in higher geopolitical risk going forward,"" he added.
Appetite for safe haven assets pushed yen up 0.3% to $107.7, while currencies of oil-exporting countries such as the Norwegian crown, the Canadian dollar and the Russian rouble were also in demand.
The U.S. dollar was up 0.1% against a basket of currencies.
Elsewhere in bond markets, core longer-dated euro zone bond yields tumbled as the Saudi developments and the poor data from China helping boosted demand for safe-haven assets. Brexit uncertainty also weighed.
Germany's 10-year benchmark was down at -0.479%. Bund futures rose 0.3%, while futures for U.S. 10-year Treasury notes rose 0.4%.

""While there are no doubt short-term inflationary implications from an oil price shock, we would imagine that US rates will fall, given rising growth fears,"" Citi's Willer said.

114,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 16, 2019 08:01AM ET</span>",Out-of-whack Credit Suisse security puzzles volatility traders,"By Saqib Iqbal Ahmed
NEW YORK (Reuters) - A small, unexplained aberration in a highly specialized corner of the vast U.S. equity and derivatives market is causing a buzz among traders already on edge about a potential market pullback.
An exchange-traded note issued by  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Group AG, commonly known as TVIX, that tracks stock market volatility is trading at a premium of about 3% over what it should be priced based on its underlying securities. That premium is about twice the average for the past year.
While TVIX is not considered a bellwether for the stock market, at a time when investors are jittery about the health of the equities market any unexplained price moves serves to unnerve investors.
(Graphic: TVIX - trading at a premium, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/12/6111/6042/Pasted%20Image.jpg)
In the past, the TVIX premium has risen when stocks have fallen. So a persistent premium when equity markets are relatively strong has stumped specialized traders of volatility.
Normally, traders do not pay much heed to how the TVIX is behaving. But these are not usual times. The S&P 500 is flirting with all-time highs, despite signs that U.S. President Donald Trump's trade war with China and Britain’s planned exit from the European Union may be pushing the world into a recession.
To many traders it is only a matter of time before markets fall, and they want to see it coming before others do.
The TVIX is of the same genre as an ETN called XIV, which went bust in a matter of days in February 2018 after a spike in its premium. Holders of that security saw nearly $2 billion of their money go poof, a disappearing act that some traders say exacerbated a massive correction in the U.S. stock market. Both ETNs are issued by the Swiss bank Credit Suisse.
""Obviously XIV is very fresh in our minds since its demise,” said Ben Pinkleton, an independent trader in Greensboro, North Carolina, who owns 2,500 shares of TVIX.
Although XIV and TVIX have differences, Pinkleton added, ""You never want to be in that situation as a trader. So when questions are raised about TVIX you're going to be a little restless.""
THEORETICAL PRICE
Formally known as VelocityShares Daily 2x VIX Short-Term ETN, TVIX tracks twice the returns of the S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures Index, a measure of market volatility.
Its tendency to rise in price when stocks slip has made it a darling of traders looking for a way to guard against a slump in equity prices. It is now the largest VIX-linked exchange traded product, with about $850 million in assets. It is heavily traded, with some 42 million shares changing hands daily, according to Refinitiv data.
As its issuer, Credit Suisse publishes a theoretical price for the TVIX through the day so traders know what its value would be if it were doing a perfect job of tracking the S&P VIX futures index.
(Graphic: TVIX - market value, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/12/6110/6041/Pasted%20Image.jpg)
TECHNICAL PROBLEM?
The current aberration in the TVIX could be a technical problem that gets resolved without any incident, traders and analysts said.
One explanation of why the premium may have appeared lies in how Credit Suisse controls the supply of new shares, traders and analysts said.
When the TVIX trades at a premium to its theoretical value, large financial institutions short it. When the issuer releases new shares at the theoretical value, the financial institutions settle the short position and pocket the profit.
On occasion, however, the premium can balloon, especially if the issuer ceases to create new shares. In 2012, for example, the TVIX premium rose to 90% after Credit Suisse temporarily suspended further issuances of TVIX shares due to internal limits on the size of ETNs.
""The fact that a significant premium in TVIX has persisted implies that they (Credit Suisse) have not been issuing enough shares for whatever reason,"" said Matt Thompson, managing partner at Chicago-based investment adviser Thompson Capital Management, which specializing in investments using VIX instruments.
YELLOW FLAG
Seth Golden, chief market strategist for the advisory Finom Group, said Credit Suisse may not want to issue new shares if it is more expensive for it to do so. The bank buys derivatives such as swaps to hedge risks it takes on by creating new shares, which represent unsecured debt, and their price may have gone up, Golden said.
The price of the swaps, however, is not widely known.
Credit Suisse has not explained the premium so far. It declined to comment to Reuters on the trading price for TVIX or whether there was any change to the process of share creation.
Analysts and traders said that while Credit Suisse may not be issuing new shares, they did not know for sure and that has put already nervous traders more on edge.
""In general, a premium or a discount between the indicative value and the trading value is a yellow flag,"" said Vance Harwood, who runs the alternative investment website Six Figure Investing and is a consultant focused on volatility-linked products.
""It's an indication that you should look closer to see if there is a market disruption or this is just the variations in the cost of borrowing or cost of creating shares,"" he said."

The European Commission opened separate probes into so-called tax rulings that Belgian doled out to multinational companies from 2005 to 2014, it said in an emailed statement on Monday. The rulings ""may have given a selective advantage"" to the companies ""allowing them to pay substantially less tax.""
The other companies targeted include BASF (DE:BASFN),  BP  (LON:BP),   British American Tobacco   (LON:BATS), Atlas Copco (OTC:ATLKY) , Belgacom, Dow Corning,   Pfizer   (NYSE:PFE), Wabco (NYSE:WBC), Celio International, and Bridgestone (T:5108).
The announcement comes a day before Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) fights another tax battle with the EU at the same court, hoping it can also overturn an order to pay back billions of euros. Starting new probes in a case the EU thought it had wrapped up in 2016 shows the determination of Margrethe Vestager, the EU’s antitrust chief, to push on with a corporate crackdown. She’s been tasked with drafting new digital tax rules if global reforms don’t make progress.
The EU’s General Court threw out the initial tax investigation in February, saying regulators had failed to show the 39 firms were part of a specific tax program. The new investigations avoid that issue by probing each deal individually. The commission says the “excessive profit” rulings resulted in exempting the companies’ accounting profit from tax by more than 50% and sometimes up to 90%."

The iPhone maker can tell the EU General Court in Luxembourg that it’s the world’s biggest taxpayer. But that’s not enough for EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager who said in a 2016 ruling that Apple’s tax deals with Ireland allowed the company to pay far less than other businesses. The court must now weigh whether regulators were right to levy a record 13 billion-euro ($14.4 billion) tax bill.
Apple’s haggling over tax comes after its market valuation hit $1.02 trillion last week on the back of a new aggressive pricing strategy that may stoke demand for some smartphones and watches. The company’s huge revenue -- and those of other technology firms -- have attracted close scrutiny in Europe, focusing on complicated company structures for transferring profits generated from intellectual property.
A court ruling, likely to take months, could empower or halt Vestager’s tax probes, which are now centering on fiscal deals done by Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG). She’s also been tasked with coming up with a “fair European tax” by the end of 2020 if global efforts to reform digital taxation don’t make progress.
“Politically, this will have very big consequences,” said Sven Giegold, a Green member of the European Parliament. “If Apple wins this case, the calls for tax harmonization in Europe will take on a different dynamic, you can count on that.”
Vestager showed her determination to fight the tax cases to the end by opening new probes into 39 companies’ tax deals with Belgium on Monday. The move addresses criticism by the same court handling the Apple challenge. A February judgment threw out her 2016 order for them to pay back about 800 million euros.
Apple’s fury at the EU’s 2016 order saw Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook blasting the EU move as “total political crap.” The company’s legal challenge claims the EU wrongly targeted profits that should be taxed in the U.S. and “retroactively changed the rules” on how global authorities calculate what’s owed to them.
The U.S. Treasury weighed in too, saying the EU was making itself a “supra-national tax authority” that could threaten global tax reform efforts. President Donald Trump hasn’t been silent either, saying Vestager “hates the United States” because “she’s suing all our companies.”
“There is a lot at stake given the high-profile nature of the case, as well as the concerns that have been raised from the U.S. Treasury that the investigations risk undermining the international tax system,” said Nicole Robins, a partner at economics consultancy Oxera in Brussels.
Apple declined to comment ahead of the hearing, referring to previous statements. The European Commission also declined to comment. Ireland said it “profoundly” disagreed with the EU’s findings.
Richard Murphy, a professor at London’s City University, said the EU’s case “is about making clear that no company should be beyond the geographic limits of tax law.”
“Selective attempts to get round the law -- which is what tax avoidance is -- are unacceptable when companies seek the protection and support of that same law” in the rest of their business,” Murphy said.
Vestager has also fined Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) some $9 billion. She’s ordered Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) to pay back taxes -- a mere 250 million euros -- and is probing Nike's (NYSE:NKE) tax affairs and looking into Google’s taxation in Ireland.
The first hints of how the Apple case may turn out will come from a pair of rulings scheduled for Sept. 24.
The General Court will rule on whether the EU was right to demand unpaid taxes from Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) and a Fiat Chrysler (NYSE:FCAU) unit. Those judgments could set an important precedent on how far the EU can question tax decisions national governments make on how companies should be treated.
“It’s very clear that the largest companies in the world -- the frightful five I call them -- are hardly paying taxes,” said Paul Tang, a socialist lawmaker at the European Parliament. “Cases like these, Amazon in Luxembourg or Apple in Ireland, started to build public and political pressure” for tax reform in Europe.
The legal battles may go on for a few years more. The General Court rulings can be appealed once more to the EU’s highest tribunal, the EU Court of Justice. Meanwhile, Apple’s back taxes -- 14.3 billion euros including interest -- sit in an escrow account and can’t be paid to Ireland until the final legal challenges are exhausted.
For Alex Cobham, chief executive of the Tax Justice Network campaign group, the issue is already in the past and “it’s not even the biggest tax scandal that Apple has” after reports on other structures it may use. Tax reforms under discussion “will ensure much closer alignment of taxable profits and the real economic activity” generated by them.
The cases are: T-892/16, Apple Sales International and Apple Operations Europe v. Commission, T-778/16, Ireland v. Commission."
120,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 16, 2019 06:12AM ET</span>","Political turmoil, price freeze cast shadow on Argentina's Vaca Muerta","By Cassandra Garrison
BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - In late August, amid a sharp plunge in the Argentine peso, global suppliers to oil giant YPF received an unwelcome surprise in their inbox. A four-page notice that dollar contracts would be paid at a set exchange rate, far weaker than the market rate.
In the unsigned, undated document, obtained by Reuters, state-controlled YPF set the exchange rate at 45.19 pesos per dollar for 90 days, about a quarter below the current price, saying it faced an ""unprecedented"" challenge amid government fuel price caps and a brewing financial crisis.
The move rattled suppliers and global energy firms and will likely lead to a slowing of operations in the country's huge Vaca Muerta shale play, where foreign companies were lured by promises of stability under business-friendly President Mauricio Macri.
Now they are getting worried. Macri was sorely beaten in a primary election last month by left-leaning Peronist rival Alberto Fernandez who is now the favorite to win a presidential election next month. The country is also grappling with newly-imposed capital controls and a mounting debt crisis.
""They talk about how Vaca Muerta is the goose that lays the golden egg. Well, the goose is over the chopping block right now,"" a senior executive at an energy company that holds contracts with YPF who received the letter told Reuters.
Vaca Muerta, which covers an area about the size of Belgium in the rugged southern region of Patagonia, is thought to contain one of the world's largest reserves of unconventional oil and gas. It remains largely untapped.
Martina Gallardo-Barreyro, an assistant vice president and analyst for Moody's who specializes in the Latin America oil and gas sector, said a government fuel price freeze and the YPF's subsequent currency change implied a definite slowdown for Vaca Muerta operations, though the full extent is still unknown. 
""Projects that are on the limit of becoming not economically viable will be postponed. Projects will be postponed to keep cash. This is what happens. When you don't have a clear view of what is going to happen in your revenues and the cost of funding, it's very difficult circumstances,"" she said.
""The fact that this is happening, it's astonishing that we are talking about this,"" Gallardo-Barreyro said.   
Argentina needs foreign companies to help it explore and exploit Vaca Muerta, which is hopes will create a shale boom to rival that of the United States and lift the country out of seemingly endemic economic crises.
The executive, who declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the matter, said the currency maneuver by YPF would mean a loss of ""millions and millions of dollars per month"" for his company.
U.S. energy firms involved in Argentina including  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM) and Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) are watching the economic and policy situation closely, though they did not comment directly on the exchange rate freeze or confirm whether they planned to cut back on business in Argentina.
 Halliburton Co  Chief Executive Jeffrey Miller in early September cited ""political and fiscal headwinds in Argentina"" as among conditions restraining the company’s improved outlook for this quarter. Halliburton opened Argentina's first sand storage and loading facility in 2014 to help develop shale assets.
 Chevron  Corp (NYSE:CVX) spokesman Ray Fohr said a ""stable and predictable business environment is essential to draw investment capital on the scale that is needed to ensure growth and expansion for Vaca Muerta."" The company earlier this year laid out plans to drill between 60 and 70 wells in Vaca Muerta.
FINANCIAL TURMOIL
YPF's move came after Argentina's peso currency plunged sharply following the primary election defeat for Macri, who has been pushing to attract energy investment into the country.
In response, the government said it would hold down fuel prices to protect hard-hit consumers already grappling with a deep recession and inflation running above 50%.
Soon after, in the letter sent to overseas suppliers and partners, YPF said the ""critical"" situation was ""totally unforeseen and alien"". The sharp peso fall and the government price freeze was raising the firm's costs and hitting sales.
""This situation forces us to review the entire supply chain,"" YPF said.
YPF, in a statement to Reuters, said the notice's ""sole purpose is to maintain financially sustainable operations"" while the price freeze was in effect. The firm added that it had adjusted the agreed rate since to 46.69 pesos per dollar after Macri introduced currency controls to help stabilize the peso. On Friday, the peso closed at 56.15 to the dollar.
Fernandez, the strong favorite to win the Oct. 27 election, has given mixed signals about his intentions for Vaca Muerta, spooking some he could revert to interventionist policies of his running mate, ex-President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner.
""There's no point in having oil if in order to extract it you have to let multinationals come and take it away,"" Fernandez said during a recent trip to Madrid.
In a television interview a few days later, Fernandez played down his comments, saying he had no issue with multinational firms, though it would be better for Argentina to develop its own technologies to extract its mineral wealth.
Fernandez also met with miners in late August, saying his team had been working on a plan to create a legal framework that provides certainty for investments in Vaca Muerta and the country's lithium mining sector.
Kezia McKeague, a director in the Latin America practice at Washington-based consultants McLarty Associates who advises U.S. firms investing in Argentina's energy sector, was more positive on the moderate Peronist front-runner.
She has met with some of Fernandez' advisers and was present at the meeting with mining companies in Buenos Aires last month.
""Despite some mixed signals, Alberto Fernandez and his advisors have made clear that private investment is essential to developing Argentina's non-conventional reserves,"" McKeague said. ""And to bringing needed dollars into the economy.""

Bailey said some shares would face dual, conflicting obligations because of the overlap between U.K. and EU rules. “It is therefore easy to conclude that for those shares, market liquidity would be damaged to no good end,” he said in prepared remarks published Monday.
Bailey’s speech at Bloomberg’s London office came with Brexit negotiations at an impasse, as Prime Minister Boris Johnson sticks to his pledge that Britain will leave the EU “do or die” on Oct. 31 despite widespread opposition in the U.K. parliament. The lingering possibility of a chaotic divorce has led financial regulators in recent weeks to step up contingency plans to limit disruption in markets and ensure banking, investment and trading continues between the U.K. and EU.
While regulators say the biggest threats to finance are contained, headaches remain for 16 trillion pounds ($19.9 trillion) in uncleared derivatives contracts, cross-border access for stock exchanges and the exchange of data between firms in the EU and U.K. Bailey said more work was needed on plans for all these issues.
“At the FCA, we will take a pragmatic approach to issues as they arise. We will use forbearance generously but appropriately, to maintain market integrity and protect consumers and market uses,” he said.
The FCA, Bank of England and European authorities have all redoubled their efforts to encourage financial firms to make sure their own plans are in order. Just last week, the FCA warned firms against complacency and encouraged companies to seek any temporary permissions needed as soon as possible.
After the original March deadline for Brexit was delayed, financial firms slowed their preparations and refrained from moving assets and staff to new hubs in the EU from London. “Brexit fatigue” took hold of finance, European regulators said in a report last week that warned the industry against complacency about the no-deal possibility.
In the event of a no-deal exit, the FCA would take a pragmatic approach toward enforcing U.K. rules in a bid to help calm markets, Bailey said in a Bloomberg TV interview on Monday.
“To not forbear would be to damage our objectives, and our objectives are integrity and the operation of markets,” Bailey said. “Clearly the authorities, the FCA, central banks, other regulatory authorities will have a very big role to play to step in there and deal with it as most appropriate and as best they could,” he said. “We would not stand on the sidelines.”

122,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 16, 2019 05:48AM ET</span>",Wall Street’s Pay Slump Since the Crisis Is Led by Goldman Sachs,"(Bloomberg) --  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). Chief Executive Officer David Solomon was paid $23 million last year, a third of what his predecessor received in 2007. Other Goldman employees haven’t fared much better.
Compensation per employee is down by 61% at the Wall Street firm when adjusted for nominal wage growth in the period, according to company filings and calculations by Bloomberg. Goldman had the sharpest pay decline among a dozen of the largest U.S. and European banks, followed by  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Group AG at 46%. The group had an average reduction of 14%.
Thanks in part to tax cuts and strong consumer spending, the biggest U.S. banks are more profitable than ever, and European lenders are recovering. That hasn’t translated, however, into better pay for traders and investment bankers. And financial companies joining the shift to automation that’s also reshaping other industries may mean the pre-crisis period will forever be the high water mark for outsize salaries in banking.
Pay cuts have been most dramatic at relatively small Wall Street firms that focus on investment banking, securities trading and wealth management and lack the large retail operations of rivals. It’s not only the bonuses that have declined since the 2008 crisis, but falling compensation reflects a shift from risky trading to consumer banking and wealth management. Banks also have raced to adopt high-end technology, changing their mix of employees in the process.
“Business has transformed over the past decade,” said Richard Lipstein, managing director in the financial-services practice at recruiting firm Gilbert Tweed International. “Traders have been the worst hit as trading isn’t what it used to be. Now jobs are in technology and retail. You may add more employees, but those are not as high-paying as traders.”
Goldman Sachs, once the symbol of cutthroat trading, has ventured into consumer services, credit cards and transaction banking. Credit Suisse has focused more on wealth management, while moving support functions to lower-cost locations like Poland and India to cut costs.
A 36% drop in compensation at  Deutsche Bank  AG (DE:DBKGn) when adjusted for rising European wages was partly due to the 2010 acquisition of domestic retail bank Deutsche Postbank AG and the addition of 20,000 tellers, mortgage bankers and other lower-paid personnel. Deutsche Bank’s traders and bankers, once highly compensated, have seen their pay diminish over the past 12 years as well. The pay calculations take into account the nominal wage increase for the region where each bank is headquartered, which ranged from 17% to 30%.
An equities dealer who joined the company just before the financial crisis said his total compensation was about half of what it was in 2007 by the time he left at the end of last year, before Deutsche Bank announced it would close the division. The dealer asked not to be identified to avoid hurting his relationship with his current employer.
Cut in Half
His experience reflects the typical fate of sales and trading staff on Wall Street, according to Julian Bell, a managing director at Sheffield Haworth, a recruitment firm specializing in banks. Average compensation for mid-level employees in that business has been cut in half, to a range of $400,000 to $800,000, data compiled by Sheffield Haworth show.
Investment bankers had their pay reduced by about a third, with a mid-level banker now getting $600,000 to $950,000, Bell said. Compensation for managing directors has fallen roughly 30%, to an average of $1.5 million to $2 million.
“There’s still fierce competition for investment bankers because the advisory boutiques have grabbed a lot of market share and can hijack top talent from the big banks,” said Bell, who heads the investment-banking practice. “So the full-service banks still have to pay more than they’d like to for their bankers. The same isn’t true for traders as trading revenue and profitability have shrunk and you still need big balance sheets to be successful.”
Cash Bonuses
Another change since the crisis is in the makeup of compensation. Big earners used to get relatively small salaries and much larger cash bonuses. Salaries have gone up, while cash bonuses have shrunk. The European Union even passed legislation that restricted the size of a banker’s bonus relative to salary. And bonuses in Europe and the U.S. are now mostly in the form of deferred stock awards, with the aim of aligning an employee’s long-term interests with the well-being of his or her firm.
At Goldman Sachs, the $27 million cash bonus accounted for almost half of the CEO’s compensation in 2007. Last year, it was $5.7 million, or about a quarter. Deferred compensation also prevents top earners from leaving easily.
“I’m forever talking to bank executives who want to get out, but they can’t walk away from their stock that hasn’t vested,” said John Burr, managing partner at executive-search firm Westcott Black Partners. “And other financial firms are looking to hire talent from the banks, but they balk at buying senior people’s deferred comp.”
At a few of the largest banks, per-worker compensation has risen in the past decade, with the biggest increases at Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC). and  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Plc. Barclays has been shrinking its retail footprint globally, including a 2017 exit from Africa that eliminated 40,000 lower-paid positions. Also, the British pound’s 20% decline against the dollar and several other currencies over the past 10 years has increased payroll costs in the U.S. and Asia, which account for more than a third of the bank’s headcount.
Bank of America closed more than 1,000 branches around the U.S. and cut some 80,000 jobs after the crisis. It’s also reduced back-office jobs that could be replaced with technology, while hiring pricier client-facing employees, contributing to higher per-employee compensation. And Bank of America gave employees special bonuses following the Trump administration’s corporate-tax cut, and increased its minimum hourly pay.
 Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co., which is focused mostly on consumer banking and has a relatively small investment-banking arm, has been adding compliance staff after a series of scandals related to the handling of its customers in recent years. Those positions are higher-paid than tellers or other branch personnel.
“Retail banking still requires a local presence,” said Jeanne Branthover, managing partner at recruitment firm DHR International. “People still like to go to the branch, so the banks still have tellers and wealth managers in branches, and some banks are expanding again. Pay was never as significant for the branch staff, but it’s been holding up too, rising along with average wages.”"

Investing.com -- Oil and gas stocks surged and airlines and other cyclicals suffered Monday as the world was forced to rip up its oil price forecasts in the wake of the attack on Saudi Arabia’s oil facilities at the weekend.
By 5 AM ET,   BP   (LON:BP) and Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) had shot to the top of the U.K. FTSE 100, rising 3.8% and 2.8% respectively, while there were more spectacular gains for pure upstream plays such as   Tullow Oil   (LON:TLW) and Lundin Petroleum, which rose 8.9% and 6.7%.
Europe’s other majors, Equinor (OL:EQNR),  Total  (PA:TOTF),   ENI   (MI:ENI) and Repsol (MC:REP), all rose between 4.3% and 1.5%.
Another big gainer was Norway’s  Seadrill  (OL:SDRL), which had appeared to be skidding toward a second insolvency process as oil prices wilted in August. It rose 7.0% by 4:30 AM ET and is now up 60% from its low at the start of September.
Oil and gas contractors fared less well, reflecting the fact that while a windfall is guaranteed to anyone producing oil right now, it’s still not clear whether the sudden rise will last long enough to incentivize more investment in alternative supply. Analysts at Rystad Energy predicted last week that the oilfield services sector was headed for a recession next year, after three years of expansion (although chief sectoral analyst Audun Martinsen still sees the sector returning to growth from 2021).
By 5 AM,   Technip   (PA:FTI) was up 3.7%, while   Saipem   (MI:SPMI) was up 2.0% and Petrofac (LON:PFC) was up 2.1%
As far as initial reactions are concerned, airlines provided the mirror image to the oil sector’s gains. The sector has been struggling with overcapacity and weaker demand in any case, and is not well-positioned to withstand a lasting oil price shock.
  Air France KLM   (PA:AIRFxb) was the biggest faller, losing 4.0%, while discount flyer Wizz Air (LON:WIZZ) fell 2.8% and Lufthansa (DE:LHAG) fell 2.6%.   Norwegian Air Shuttle ASA   (OL:NWC) was the outlier, rising 6.4% amid progress on restructuring two of its biggest bonds.
Overall, markets took the news from the Middle East badly, and sentiment was hurt further by weak economic data out of China, where retail sales and fixed asset investment growth fell short of expectations and industrial production grew at the slowest pace since 2002, according to data compiled by Investing.com
The benchmark Stoxx 600 was down 0.6%, while the German DAX fell by 0.7% and the Italian FTSE MIB by 1.2%. Outperformers included the FTSE 100, which lost only 0.1%, and, of course, the Russian RTS, which rose 1.3% on the prospect of the oil windfall."

Britain is due to leave the EU on Oct. 31, but has yet to agree a divorce settlement with the bloc.
Brussels has said that if there is a 'no-deal' Brexit, investment firms in the bloc must trade euro-denominated shares in the EU; many are currently heavily traded in London.
Financial Conduct Authority CEO Andrew Bailey said some of this overlap must be avoided. ""It is therefore easy to conclude that for those shares, market liquidity would be damaged to no good end,"" Bailey said in a speech at Bloomberg.
He reiterated comments from the Bank of England that extensive preparations for a no-deal Brexit would not mean that all disruption in markets can be avoided.
Brussels has said that EU customers could continue using clearing houses for derivatives in London until March next year if there is a no-deal Brexit.
This date was reflected Britain's original plan to leave the EU last March. Bailey said Brussels would need to grant an extension soon if there is a no-deal Brexit.

There is no reason to ""sacrifice open financial markets"" and many reasons to preserve them, Bailey said.

LG Display, a supplier to Apple (O:AAPL), said in a statement that Chief Executive Han Sang-beom offered to step down over mounting losses.
LG Display has been struggling with a global supply glut in liquid-crystal displays (LCDs) used in television sets, which has pushed down prices. Like many other global tech firms, it is also dealing with uncertainties caused by a Sino-U.S. trade dispute involving import tariffs on tech goods and services.
The display maker said in a statement it held an emergency board meeting to accept Han's resignation and appointed Jeong, the current chief operation officer and chief finance officer at LG Chem.
The appointment of a new CEO is subject to the approval of shareholders at a meeting scheduled next March.
In the second quarter, LG Display said its operating loss widened to 369 billion won ($313.02 million) from 228 billion won a year earlier, hit by declining prices of its main product, 50-inch liquid-crystal displays (LCDs).
""The global supply and demand balance in the display industry is still off as government-backed Chinese display makers are pouring out panels, leading to drop the display prices,"" said Park Sung-soon, an analyst at Cape Investment & Securities.
LG Display's cross-town rival Samsung (KS:005930) Display said in August it is considering suspending one of its LCD production lines in South Korea due to a supply glut."
126,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 16, 2019 04:10AM ET</span>","Start-ups to grab $280 billion in banking payments revenues by 2025, study says","By Tommy Wilkes
LONDON (Reuters) - Banks are set to miss out on as much as $280 billion in revenue from their payments operations by 2025, as new start-ups muscle in and more of the business of sending money to individuals and companies becomes instant and free, according to a new report.
The global payments business, which covers anything from card payments to wiring money overseas, is dominated by banks and this year was worth around $1.5 trillion, professional services firm Accenture (NYSE:ACN) said in a report published on Monday. 
That is expected to grow to $2 trillion globally by 2025 but banks are likely to lose out on $280 billion, or 15% of their global payments revenues, Accenture estimates.
Banks face rising competition from tech start-ups like Silicon Valley payment providers Stripe and Square (NYSE:SQ), as well as technology platform PayPal, and the likes of London-based TransferWise that offer foreign exchange payments to retail and small business customers with lower fees.
More payments are becoming instant - removing the need for credit cards that earn banks revenue - and they will increasingly be made directly to the end merchant using new technology, Accenture said. More competition also means a squeeze on margins and accelerates the trend toward free payments.
""Rather than being at the forefront of the new wave of the booming payments market, banks are feeling the heat from new competition and seeing their margins squeezed,"" said Gareth Wilson, head of Accenture's global payments team. 
""We face an inevitable world of instant, invisible and free payments, which spells trouble for banks that don't want to be relegated to the plumbing of payments."" 
Accenture said it had examined trends in how consumers pay and projected changes in the future behavior of payments providers, technology and regulation to arrive at its forecasts on the likely loss of revenue for banks.
It estimated that free payments would put 8% of banks' payment revenue at risk. A further 3.9% is at risk from non-bank rivals offering ""invisible payments"", while instant payments could take another 2.7% of revenues.
More than two-thirds of banking executives surveyed by Accenture agreed that payments were becoming free.
""The digital boom will mean banks have to fundamentally change the way they think about their revenue composition,"" said Alan McIntyre, who leads Accenture's banking practice.

""Channels that once made the banks billions of dollars will cease to exist,"" McIntyre said, adding that lenders needed to build new digital business models, with ""one-click payments the new norm.""

Saudi Aramco's longer-dated bonds bore the brunt of the falls with the 2049 issue dropping nearly 3 cents in the dollar to touch their lowest since early August, data from Tradeweb showed.
The government sovereign bonds also came under pressure, with longer-dated issues falling between 1-2 cents.
""Markets had become too sanguine over the last few months about the geopolitical risks facing countries allied with the US against Iran, with Saudi Arabia particularly vulnerable,"" said Patrick Wacker at UOB Asset Management.
""While Saudi Arabia’s sovereign fundamentals are still firm, bond prices will need to factor in higher geopolitical risk going forward.""
On Monday, Saudi stocks (TASI) gained 0.5%, with analysts pointing to support from state institutions as well as higher oil prices supporting firms. Yet the gains only partly mitigated a 1% drop on Sunday, with the index down 0.4% since the start of the year.
Blue chip Saudi Basic Industries Corp (SABIC) (SE:2010) gained 0.6% after tumbling nearly 3% on Sunday when the company said it had curtailed feedback supplies by about 49% following the attacks.
""The critical issues for Saudi Arabia and the global oil market are the extent of the damage and the time required to restore Aramco's oil and gas supply,"" said Monica Malik, chief economist at Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank, adding the short-term impact could be partly mitigated by the kingdom drawing down strategic oil reserves.
""We estimate that Saudi Arabia's fiscal deficit could widen by some 0.9-1.0% of GDP under the scenario mentioned above, though oil revenue would see some support from the higher oil price as production and exports gradually normalize.”
The International Monetary Fund estimates Saudi Arabia could hit a fiscal deficit of 6.5% of GDP compared with 5.9% in 2018, as higher government expenditure is likely to curb the upside of stronger non-oil economic growth."

AMS launched its 38.50 euro per share offer for the company earlier this month, beating a rival offer from private equity investors Bain Capital and  Carlyle Group  (O:CG) by 10%.
""Osram's executive board and the majority of its supervisory board recommend... that Osram shareholders accept the offer,"" the German group said in a statement.
Osram had initially backed the finance investors' offer, who had agreed to maintain Osram as an independent company with its current management and to support its strategic direction.
However, ""the financial attractiveness of the (AMS) offer was to be weighted higher than points of criticism.""
AMS, best known for supplying Apple (O:AAPL) with sensors for its latest iPhones, wants to focus a combined business strongly on the auto industry and supply manufacturers with sensors and lighting solutions for self-driving cars.
AMS said on Monday that feedback from investors on a global roadshow had been positive.
""Based on extensive interaction with investors in Europe, the U.S. and Asia, AMS sees strong support for its strategic vision including Osram, which is reinforcing AMS' conviction for the offer,"" the Austrian group said. Capitalising on the positive momentum, it would lower the acceptance threshold of its offer to 62.5% from the previous 70%.
The biggest Osram shareholders AMS aims to convince are Allianz Global Investors (DE:ALVG) with 9.4% of the stock, UBS (S:UBSG) with 6.2% and  Barclays  (L:BARC) with 5.5%, according to latest filings.
Osram's supervisory board decision to recommend AMS's offer was not unanimous. Employee representatives fear that AMS could break up the company. Osram's management and supervisory board are worried about the long-term business prospects.
AMS has to take on billions of debt to finance the takeover, and Osram said paying off the funds could become difficult. AMS depended largely on a group of key customers, and that entailed the risk ""that the financial situation of the combined group may become very strained"" if key customers switched to other technological solutions or place less orders.
Osram also voiced doubts whether the Austrian sensor specialist, whose number of staff is about a third of that of the German group, will be able to stem such a complex takeover.
""There is a risk that AMS may not be able to successfully organise the integration and to realise at the same time the publicly announced synergies in the intended short period of time,"" it said."

CAIRO (Reuters) - Egyptian transport technology start-up Swvl will expand into two cities in Pakistan in the next two weeks and begin operations in Nigeria's commercial capital Lagos before the end of the year, its chief executive told Reuters.
The firm, which operates buses along fixed routes and allows customers to reserve and pay for them using an app, will also expand into Manila in the first half of next year, its co-founder and CEO Mostafa Kandil told Reuters.
""We will enter Lagos before the end of the year, and our eyes are on Dar es Salaam and Abidjan,"" he said. The firm is also planning to launch in other South East Asian markets, he added.
Kandil said the company is seeking to raise more than $100 million in a financing round in the first half of next year, and is targeting a $1 billion valuation in the next five years.
Since its launch in April 2017 Swvl has secured the biggest round of funding for a tech start-up in Egypt.
""We were a company worth about $2 million two years ago and our paid-up capital is now $80 million,"" he said.
Kandil said he hoped Swvl would eventually go public, but did not say on which stock exchange. He said he would in the longer term also consider a buyout offer from the likes of ride-hailing giant Uber (N:UBER).
Kandil, 25, said the company has been losing money, but expects to turn a profit in two to three years.
""This year we have entered about seven new cities and next year we are targeting another 10 to 20 new big cities,"" Kandil said.
The Cairo-based firm, which is due to move its headquarters to Dubai in November, launched in Nairobi about six months ago and began operations in Lahore in July.
""We aim to reach one million trips a day in Egypt over the next five years,"" said Kandil.
He and two other young Egyptian co-founders, Mahmoud Nouh and Ahmed Sabbah, own more than 30% of the company, he said.
The rest is held by 17 investment funds, including U.S.-based Autotech Ventures, Sweden's Vostok New Ventures, Oman's sovereign wealth fund, the UAE's BECO Capital and China's MSA Capital.
The Swvl app, which has fixed bus routes, uses the passenger's location and destination to determine the shortest possible trip time based on the nearest bus stop.

It caused Saudi Arabia to halve its oil output and may cut the valuation of Aramco’s milestone deal.
The giant oil producer has accelerated preparations for a share sale that could happen as soon as November in Riyadh. Dozens of bankers from  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C). to JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co. met last week to work on the deal, with analyst presentations scheduled for Sept. 22, people familiar with the matter have said.
“Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman will push the company to demonstrate that it can effectively tackle terrorism or war challenges,” analysts led by Ayham Kamel, head of Middle East and North Africa research at the Eurasia Group, said in a report. “The attacks could complicate Aramco’s IPO plans.”
In an attack blamed by the U.S. on Iran, a swarm of drones laden with explosives set the world’s biggest crude-processing plant ablaze. Floating a minority stake of the oil giant, officially known as Saudi Arabian Oil Co., is part of Prince Mohammed’s efforts to modernize and diversify the economy.
The attacks underscored geopolitical tensions in the region. Iran denied responsibility, which was instead claimed by Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen.
Oil prices surged by the most on record to more than $71 a barrel after the strike removed about 5% of global supplies. The main Saudi stock index Sunday fell as much as 3.1%, leading losses in the Gulf.
Back in 2017, investors suspected that Saudi government-related funds swooped in to support the market after the imprisonment of local billionaires at the Ritz-Carlton in Riyadh. That also happened amid the international crisis following columnist Jamal Khashoggi’s murder at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul.
Here’s more from analysts and investors:
Eurasia
“The latest attack on Aramco facilities will have only a limited impact on interest in Aramco shares as the first stage of the IPO will be local. The international component of the sale would be more sensitive to geopolitical risks”Current valuation estimates for Aramco and its assets might not fully account for geopolitical risksNOTE: Prince Mohammed, the architect of the IPO, has said he expects Aramco to be valued at over $2 trillion, but analysts see $1.5 trillion as more realisticAl Dhabi Capital, Mohammed Ali Yasin
“I think this attack may delay the IPO even on the local exchange, and could affect the valuation negatively, as the investors have seen a live demonstration of the risk levels of the future revenues and business of the company. That was very low prior to this weekend attack”“Aramco has one main source of revenue, oil. That is its strength, but now it is becoming its biggest weakness if it gets disrupted”United Securities, Joice Mathew
This “will force investors to go back to the drawing board and re-evaluate their risk models on Aramco”“Even though this is a rare event, which could be potentially categorized as 4 or 6 sigma levels, the geopolitical risk premium on Aramco’s valuation model would show a sharp increase”“As far as the pricing is concerned, my view is that there may not be much of an impact if the government is contemplating a 1% listing on the Tadawul. I think the government has the power and ability to influence the decisions of anchor investors there”Tellimer, Hasnain Malik

NEW YORK (Reuters) - OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma LP filed for bankruptcy protection Sunday night, succumbing to pressure from more than 2,600 lawsuits alleging the company helped fuel the deadly U.S. opioid epidemic.
Purdue's board met Sunday evening to approve the long-expected bankruptcy filing, which the company is pursuing to restructure under terms of a proposal to settle the widespread litigation. 
Purdue, which filed for Chapter 11 protection in a federal bankruptcy court in White Plains, New York, reached a tentative deal to resolve lawsuits with 24 states and five U.S. territories, as well as lead lawyers for more than 2,000 cities, counties and other plaintiffs, the company said.
Two dozen states remain opposed or uncommitted to the proposed settlement, setting the stage for contentious legal battles over who bears responsibility for a public health crisis that has claimed the lives of nearly 400,000 people between 1999 and 2017, according to the latest U.S. data.
Thousands of cities and counties, along with nearly every state, have sued Purdue and, in some cases, its controlling Sackler family. The lawsuits, seeking billions of dollars in damages, claim the company and family aggressively marketed prescription painkillers while misleading doctors and patients about their addiction and overdose risks. 
Purdue and the Sacklers have denied the allegations. 
Opposing states, including Massachusetts, New York and Connecticut, want the Sacklers to guarantee more of their own money will go toward a settlement, and have questioned Purdue's calculations valuing the overall deal at more than $10 billion.
The Sacklers, who would cede control of Purdue in the proposed settlement, have offered $3 billion in cash and an additional $1.5 billion or more through the eventual sale of another company they own, called Mundipharma, according to the company and people familiar with the terms. The Sacklers have declined to revise their offer.
""This is the fork in the road. There are only two ways to go from here,"" said Purdue Chairman Steve Miller in an interview with Reuters.
Miller said Purdue plans to argue to opposing states that fighting the proposed settlement will likely result in protracted litigation, increasing legal fees and depleting value that could be steered to U.S. communities reeling from opioid abuse. He described bankruptcy proceedings as the ""best hope for finalizing and implementing a global resolution to this litigation."" 
In a statement, members of the Sackler family controlling Purdue said they hoped those opposing the current settlement offer would eventually change their minds. 
""It is our hope the bankruptcy reorganization process that is now underway will end our ownership of Purdue and ensure its assets are dedicated for the public benefit,"" the family said. 
The outcome of Purdue's attempted bankruptcy reorganization and settlement negotiations will help determine how much money U.S. communities receive from the company and the Sacklers to address harm from opioids. A reorganization and settlement would ultimately need to be approved by a U.S. bankruptcy judge. 
States suing the Sacklers, including several over the past week, allege the family improperly reaped billions of dollars from opioid sales despite knowledge of their harmful effects. The Sacklers, some of whom previously served on the Purdue's board and are well-known wealthy philanthropists, have denied the allegations. 
Purdue's proposed settlement envisions it becoming a trust that would contribute to U.S. communities, at little or no cost, tens of millions of doses of drugs the company developed to combat opioid overdoses and addiction, the company said.
Purdue values the drugs at $4.45 billion over a decade, the people familiar with the matter said. Under the proposal's terms, the restructured Purdue would be permanently bound by so-called injunctive relief, which includes restrictions on the promotion and sale of opioids. 
States opposing the settlement offer have vowed to fight attempts by Purdue and the Sacklers to use bankruptcy proceedings to contain the litigation.
On Friday, New York Attorney General Letitia James said she uncovered roughly $1 billion in wire transfers ""between the Sacklers, entities they control and different financial institutions, including those that have funneled funds into Swiss bank accounts.""
The information, in records an unnamed financial institution produced in response to a subpoena from James's office, detailed financial transfers involving former Purdue board member Mortimer D.A. Sackler, according to court documents her office filed. 
He allegedly used shell companies ""to shift Purdue money through accounts around the world and then conceal it in at least two separate multimillion-dollar real estate investments back here in New York, sanitized (until now) of any readily-detectable connections to the Sackler family,"" a lawyer in James' office said in one of the court filings.
""There is nothing newsworthy about these decade-old transfers, which were perfectly legal and appropriate in every respect,"" a spokesman for Mortimer D.A. Sackler said in a statement. 
""This is a cynical attempt by a hostile AG's office to generate defamatory headlines to try to torpedo a mutually beneficial settlement that is supported by so many other states and would result in billions of dollars going to communities and individuals across the country that need help,"" the statement added. 
Purdue, meanwhile, plans to ask a bankruptcy judge to halt active litigation so it can negotiate a final settlement, the people said. But the company is preparing for states to argue their lawsuits cannot be halted by a Chapter 11 filing because their legal actions were brought to enforce public health and safety laws - exempting them from the usual bankruptcy rules that would stop their complaints.
Another thorny legal question involves the Sacklers and under what circumstances Purdue could use bankruptcy law in an attempt to also halt lawsuits against them. 

Those legal skirmishes could take some time to develop, as Purdue initially must seek court approval to continue paying employees and address routine operating expenses.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) said on Monday it had agreed to pay up to A$127 million ($87.3 million) to settle lawsuits brought on behalf of thousands of Australian customers caught up in its global diesel emissions cheating scandal.
The German automaker said it would pay about A$1,400 each to owners of affected Volkswagen, Audi and Skoda EA189 diesel vehicles who opted into the lawsuit.
""This is a significant step toward fully resolving the diesel lawsuits in Australia,"" a Sydney-based Volkswagen spokesman said in an emailed statement.
As part of the settlement, which was agreed on a ""no-admissions basis"", Volkswagen will pay the legal costs of the claimants who filed several class-action lawsuits.
""This is an important step in providing a measure of justice and redress to the thousands of Australian motorists who claim they were financially impacted by the diesel emissions issue,"" principal lawyer at Maurice Blackburn, Julian Schimmel said.
The settlement is subject to court approval.
The settlement follows revelations in 2015 that Volkswagen was using an illegal engine-control software to cheat pollution tests. The company has already paid billions of dollars in legal costs around the world.
The Australian consumer watchdog in 2016 also sued the German carmaker alleging it intentionally sold more than 57,000 vehicles with software which deceived buyers about levels of toxic emissions. [https://reut.rs/2maOJl8]
Volkswagen said it expected to settle that lawsuit shortly.
In the United States, Volkswagen has already agreed to pay more than $25 billion in claims from owners, environmental regulators, states and dealers and offered to buy back about 500,000 polluting U.S. vehicles.
In May, the group said it had set aside 5.5 billion euros ($6.1 billion) in contingent liabilities of which 3.4 billion euros had been earmarked to cover potential lawsuits.

LONDON (Reuters) - Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HK:0388) is embarking on a three-week charm offensive with  London Stock Exchange  (L:LSE) investors as the Asian trading house tries to salvage its proposed $39 billion takeover offer.
LSE's board is refusing to engage with HKEX after emphatically rejecting its approach on Friday. The LSE described HKEX's offer as fundamentally flawed, saying it would not meet its strategic objectives and came with a high risk of being blocked by regulators.
LSE has said it wants to stick with its plan of buying data and trading company Refinitiv for $27 billion.
But HKEX has vowed to press on, and has set up meetings with a series of LSE's top investors over the next few weeks, according to two people familiar with the matter, raising the chances that it could make a hostile offer. 
One top-25 investor told Reuters they had a meeting booked with HKEX later this month and that there could be a hostile approach. Others said they were keen to hear more rather than dismissing the deal immediately in favor of the Refinitiv tie-up. 
""We would expect there to be some synergy (in the HKEX deal) both in terms of corporate overheads and technology,"" said James Bevan, chief investment officer at CCLA. He added that while he was broadly supportive of the Refinitiv deal, he had some concerns about the data firm's growth strategy.
HKEX has until Oct. 9 to make a firm offer or walk away. 
HKEX declined to comment on the deal beyond its statement on Friday that it would continue to engage with LSE shareholders and that its offer was in their best interests.
LSE did not respond to a request for comment on Sunday.
REGULATORY RISK
A source close to HKEX said the Asian trading house was confident some LSE investors were interested in their offer and that it had a chance of success. They pointed out that around 15 of the top 20 LSE shareholders also had stakes in HKEX.
But the past decade has seen a series of attempts at cross-border exchange deals fail, thwarted by regulators and politicians even when both companies have favored the deal. 
HKEX says it has had ""constructive"" initial discussions with regulators and policymakers. However, regulatory sources in Britain and Italy - where LSE owns Borsa Italiana - said they had yet to hold substantive talks with HKEX on the deal. 
HKEX will be counting on its lead banker - Moelis's Caroline Silver - to help it pull off what would be a major coup if it succeeds. 
One of the most prominent exchange bankers, Silver worked on LSE's takeover of Borsa Italiana in 2007 when at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), and represented London Metal Exchange when HKEX bought it in 2012.

""Her modus is quite simple: she knows everybody in the exchange and financial infrastructure world, she understands the markets ... and she runs a very disciplined process,"" said Martin Abbott, London Metal Exchange's former chief executive.

DETROIT (Reuters) - The United Auto Workers (UAW) said on Sunday that its roughly 48,000 hourly workers at General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) facilities would go on strike as of midnight Sunday after labor contract talks reached an impasse over wide-ranging issues from wages to health care benefits and temporary workers.
""We do not take this lightly,"" Terry Dittes, the UAW vice president in charge of the union's relationship with GM, said at a press conference in downtown Detroit. ""This is our last resort.""
Earlier on Sunday 850 maintenance workers at five GM facilities walked off the job on strike.
The union has been fighting to stop GM from closing auto assembly plants in Ohio and Michigan and arguing that workers deserve higher pay after years of record profits for GM in North America.
GM officials have said the plant shutdowns are necessary responses to market shifts, and that UAW wages and benefits are expensive compared with competing non-union auto plants in the southern United States.
Before the union's previous four-year contract with the No. 1 U.S. automaker expired at midnight on Sunday, Dittes said that ""significant differences"" remained between the two sides over wages, health care benefits, temporary employees, job security and profit sharing.
""We are standing up for fair wages, we are standing up for affordable, quality health care,"" Dittes said on Sunday. ""We are standing up for our share of the profits.""
A broad strike by the union would be the first such action at GM in 12 years and would test both the union and GM Chief Executive Mary Barra at a time when the U.S. auto industry is facing a slowdown in sales, and rising costs for launching electric vehicles and curbing emissions.
GM starts off the strike with healthy levels of inventory of some its key, high-margin vehicles.
As of Sept. 1, the automaker had 96 days supply of its Chevrolet Silverado pickup truck, 59 days supply of its Chevrolet Equinox SUV and more than 100 days supply of the Cadillac Escalade.
If the strike is short, hourly workers should not suffer much. But strike pay provided by the UAW, which has been building up reserves in preparation for possible industrial action, is just $250 per week.
This is far below their normal wages and means that the longer the strike goes on, the harder it will be for GM's workers to pay their bills.
Earlier on Sunday, the UAW said maintenance workers employed by GM contractor Aramark would strike at five GM plants in Michigan and Ohio.
The automaker has 12 vehicle assembly plants, 12 engine and power train facilities and a handful of stamping plants and other facilities around the United States.
The UAW said the Aramark workers have been in negotiations since March 2018, and the company and union are at odds over pay and benefits.
GM did immediately respond to a request for comment, but said last Saturday it was ""prepared to negotiate around the clock.""
A UAW spokesman did not say whether talks have resumed.
On Friday, the UAW announced temporary contract extensions with Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCA) while it focused its attention on GM. The union had targeted GM as the first automaker with which it wanted to conclude contract talks.
This year's talks had been expected to be contentious but have been complicated by recent developments in a longstanding federal investigation into corruption at the union.
The probe has raised questions about UAW President Gary Jones, who was identified as an unnamed official mentioned in a searing federal complaint this week detailing alleged embezzlement by union leaders.
Jones has not been charged and denies any wrongdoing. He remained in office after a meeting of union leaders Friday.
Jones did not attend the union's press conference on Sunday morning.
The spreading probe raises questions about the union's options and its leaders' standing with rank-and-file members.
GM's workers last went out on a brief two-day strike in 2007 during contract talks. A more painful strike occurred in Flint, Michigan, in 1998, lasting 54 days and costing the No. 1 U.S. automaker more than $2 billion."

Police investigating the deadly collapse of a bridge in Genoa last year said on Friday they had found evidence that safety reports for some viaducts had been falsified and placed under house arrest three employees of firms owned by Atlantia.
In a sharply worded statement, Edizione Srl, which holds 30.25% of Atlantia, said it had full respect for the latest investigation and was following the case closely.
""Edizione ... will without hesitation and immediately take all necessary action ... to safeguard the credibility, reputation and good name of its shareholders and subsidiaries,"" the Benetton holding said.
Italian newspapers said the Edizione statement represented a sharp change of tone from previous comments, when they had always defended their managers. La Repubblica said the position of Atlantia CEO Giovanni Castellucci was ""very difficult"".
The board of Edizione is due to meet on Monday. A spokesman for the holding said the meeting had already been scheduled and declined to comment further. Atlantia declined to comment.
Atlantia, which controls Italian motorway toll firm Autostrade per l'Italia, has come under scrutiny since the collapse last year of a Genoa road bridge that killed 43 people.
Il Sole 24 ore and Corriere della Sera newspapers reported that Autostrade could be sold or spun-off, but the Edizione spokesman denied the reports. ""This is not an option that can be considered,"" he said.
The three people placed under house arrest on Friday are employed by Autostrade and maintenance company SPEA Engineering, the police said.
The board of SPEA offered to resign at the weekend over the scandal, while Autostrade, which is due to hold an extraordinary board meeting on Monday, said on Saturday it was suspending two of its employees as a precautionary measure.
The new investigation comes against the backdrop of heavy political pressure on Atlantia, with the ruling coalition party, the 5-Star Movement, demanding that Autostrade be stripped of its lucrative motorway concession because of the Genoa disaster.
5-Star leader Luigi Di Maio reiterated the demand on Saturday. ""We are moving ahead with our desire to revoke Atlantia's road network,"" Di Maio told reporters.
On Friday, Atlantia said it would launch an immediate audit to verify whether the companies and people targeted by the latest probe had followed internal procedures correctly."

""We do not take this lightly,"" Terry Dittes, the UAW vice president in charge of the union's relationship with GM, said at a press conference in downtown Detroit. ""This is our last resort.""
GM said in a statement that its offer to the UAW during talks included more than $7 billion in investments, 5,400 jobs - a majority of which would be new jobs - pay increases, improved benefits and a contract ratification bonus of $8,000. 
""We have negotiated in good faith and with a sense of urgency,"" the automaker said. 
Earlier on Sunday 850 maintenance workers at five GM facilities went on strike.
The union has been fighting to stop GM from closing auto assembly plants in Ohio and Michigan and arguing workers deserve higher pay after years of record profits for GM in North America.

The union has framed the plant closures as a betrayal of workers who made concessions in 2009 to help the automaker through its government-led bankruptcy.
""General Motors needs to understand that we stood up for GM when they needed us,"" Ted Krumm, head of the union's bargaining committee in talks with GM, said at the press conference Sunday. These are profitable times... and we deserve a fair contract. We helped make this company what it is.""
The strike will test both the union and GM Chief Executive Mary Barra at a time when the U.S. auto industry is facing slowing sales and rising costs for launching electric vehicles and curbing emissions.
Kristin Dziczek, vice president of industry, labor and economics at the Ann Arbor, Michigan-based Center for Automotive Research (CAR), said the strike at GM's U.S. facilities will also shut its plants in Canada and Mexico because the automaker's supply chain is so integrated.
""That's going to have a big effect on the economy,"" she said. 
GM starts off the strike with healthy levels of inventory of some its key, high-margin vehicles. 
As of Sept. 1, the automaker had 96 days supply of its Chevrolet Silverado pickup truck, 59 days supply of its Chevrolet Equinox SUV and more than 100 days supply of the Cadillac Escalade.

""The pain is deep on both sides,"" CAR's Dziczek said. ""(GM) will start to see costs immediately, but the costs (will) become prohibitive and drive them back to the table after a couple of weeks."" 
GM's workers last went out on a brief two-day strike in 2007 during contract talks. A more painful strike occurred in Flint, Michigan, in 1998, lasting 54 days and costing the No. 1 U.S. automaker more than $2 billion.
Earlier on Sunday, the UAW said maintenance workers employed by GM contractor Aramark would strike at five GM plants in Michigan and Ohio. 
The automaker has 12 vehicle assembly plants, 12 engine and power train facilities and a handful of stamping plants and other facilities around the United States.
The UAW said the Aramark workers have been in negotiations since March 2018, and the company and union are at odds over pay and benefits. 
UAW spokesman Brian Rothenberg did not say whether talks have resumed. 
On Friday, the UAW announced temporary contract extensions with Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCA) while it focused its attention on GM. The union had targeted GM as the first automaker with which it wanted to conclude contract talks.
This year's talks had been expected to be contentious but have been complicated by recent developments in a longstanding federal investigation into corruption at the union.

DETROIT (Reuters) - Leaders of the United Auto Workers (UAW) turned up the pressure on General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) on Sunday, ordering 850 maintenance workers at five GM facilities to walk off the job ahead of a meeting in Detroit on whether to call a wider strike.
After the union's four-year contract with GM expired without agreement on a new pact, the UAW said early Sunday that maintenance workers employed by Aramark would strike at five GM plants in Michigan and Ohio.
The UAW said the Aramark workers have been in negotiations since March 2018, and the company and union are at odds over pay and benefits. At GM's Flint, Michigan, assembly plant, which just launched a new heavy-duty pickup, UAW Local 598 leaders told members employed directly by GM they should report to work, crossing picket lines set up by fellow Local 598 members who work for Aramark. But union members could choose not to cross those lines.
The Flint heavy-duty pickup is vital to GM's profits. The UAW could call local strikes that target plants critical to production of large pickups and sport utility vehicles as an alternative to a company-wide strike that would more quickly drain union strike funds.
UAW leaders are expected to meet later this morning to decide what action to take and have called a press conference for 10 a.m. (1400 GMT) Sunday in Detroit.
UAW leaders signaled they remain far from a settlement with GM on a range of issues, including the future of four U.S. factories the company has indicated it will close.
""We still have many outstanding issues remaining, including significant differences (with GM)... on wages, health care benefits, temporary employees, job security and profit sharing,"" Terry Dittes, the UAW vice president who handles relations with GM, wrote in a letter to union officials issued late Saturday before the contract expired.
GM responded in a statement.
""We continue to work hard on solutions to some very difficult challenges,"" GM said. ""We are prepared to negotiate around the clock.""
On Friday, the UAW announced temporary contract extensions with Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCA) while it focused its attention on GM. The union had targeted GM as the first automaker with which it wanted to conclude contract talks.
Sources briefed on the matter this week said GM may seek a temporary extension of the contract.
This year's talks had been expected to be contentious but have been complicated by recent developments in a longstanding federal investigation into corruption at the union. The probe has raised questions about UAW President Gary Jones, who was identified as an unnamed official mentioned in a searing federal complaint this week detailing alleged embezzlement by union leaders.
Jones has not been charged and denies any wrongdoing. He remained in office after a meeting of union leaders Friday.
The spreading probe raises questions about the union's options and its leaders' standing with rank-and-file members. Last month, more than 96% of GM's hourly workers voted to authorize a strike if necessary, meaning if no deal is reached Jones could call for a walkout without further approval.
GM's workers last went out on a brief two-day strike in 2007 during contract talks. A more painful strike occurred in Flint, Michigan, in 1998, lasting 54 days and costing the No. 1 U.S. automaker more than $2 billion.
But the recent strike authorization vote was held before the dramatic events of the last few weeks, which included a late August FBI raid on Jones' home and other locations as part of the corruption probe."

DUBAI/RIYADH (Reuters) - Saudi stocks fell sharply on Sunday, after attacks on two plants at the heart of the kingdom's oil industry a day earlier knocked out more than half of Saudi crude output.
Sunday's decline extended a losing spree for Saudi stocks, which in recent weeks have been hit by expensive valuations, weak oil prices and concerns about the economic outlook.
The drone attacks were carried out by Yemen's Houthi group, its military spokesman said on Al Masirah TV.
The index (TASI) opened down 2.3% but later pared some losses.
At 0914 GMT, the Saudi market was down 1.3%. The index has lost all its gains this year and is down about 18% from its 2019 high of 9,403 points seen in early May.
The index's earlier gains were fueled by Saudi Arabia's entry into the MSCI and FTSE Russell's emerging market indices, but analysts said that effect had faded in recent weeks.
Saudi Basic Industries (SABIC) (SE:2010), the kingdom's biggest petrochemicals firm, was down 2.4% after it said it had curtailed feedback supplies by about 49% following the attacks.
Aramco has agreed to buy a 70% stake in SABIC from the state Public Investment Fund in a $69.1 billion deal that is awaiting regulatory approvals.
Other petrochemical companies such as Yanbu National Petrochemicals Co (SE:2290) and Kayan (SE:2350) also announced significant reductions in feedstock supplies.
""The stock market has been affected, especially the petchem sector, (as) the efficiency of some major companies will be about 50% in the coming 10 days,"" said Mazen al-Sudairi, head of research at Al Rajhi Capital.
Other Gulf markets also reacted negatively to the attacks, with Kuwait's premier index (BKP) down 0.4% and Dubai stocks (DFMGI) falling 0.5%, although they recovered from sharper intraday losses.
The attacks come at a bad time for Saudi Arabia, which is preparing for the listing of oil giant Saudi Aramco on the Tadawul bourse in Riyadh later this year.
The attacks are unlikely to change plans for Aramco’s long-awaited initial public offering but may affect the valuation, risk consultancy Eurasia Group said in a note.
""The latest attack on Aramco facilities will have only a limited impact on interest in Aramco shares as the first stage of the IPO will be local. The international component of the sale would be more sensitive to geopolitical risks,"" it said.
Aramco has hired nine banks as joint global coordinators to lead its IPO, slated to be the world's largest, Reuters reported, citing two sources."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Adam Neumann showed he can capitalize on troubled times a decade ago, tapping into demand for workspace by those forced out of jobs in the aftermath of the financial crisis to grow WeWork into a global brand commanding a $47 billion valuation.
Yet his plans to take WeWork's corporate parent the We Company public have backfired, as his company becomes the poster child for a bubble in venture capital fundraising that has pushed some start-ups to unsustainable valuations.
The We Company is contemplating slashing its valuation to as low as $10 billion from the $47 billion billing clinched in a private fundraising round in January backed by Japan's SoftBank Group Corp, people familiar with the matter said on Friday.
The sharp drop comes amid investor criticism of widening losses and Neumann's firm grip on the company.
Neumann, 40, is under pressure to proceed with the initial public offering (IPO) to raise cash to keep WeWork's operations going. The New York-based company rents workspace to clients under short-term contracts, even though it pays rent for them itself under long-term leases.
It is by far the biggest crisis Neumann has faced in his career, after arriving in New York at the age of 22 following service in the Israeli military.
He failed in several ventures before selling his first co-working firm, Green Door, for $300,000 with business partner Miguel McKelvey a decade ago. Neumann and McKelvey used the proceeds from that sale to start WeWork, with its first customers coming to the lower Manhattan site just off Chinatown in February 2010, after seeing ads in Craigslist.
Community was a driving force behind the new venture, launched at a time when millions who had lost jobs during the 2008 financial crisis were looking for flexible work space.
""It quickly became apparent that people were ready for a new approach to work, not just their workspace,"" Neumann said in a blog post in 2016, marking the launch in Berlin of WeWork's 100th site.
Neumann's parents divorced when he was a boy and he moved 13 times as a child and adolescent, living awhile in Indianapolis where his mother, an oncologist, finished her medical residency. He has called his childhood challenging because of the moves.
They returned to Israel where he lived in kibbutz Nir Am, near the Gaza Strip, and later served in the Israeli military, which he says taught him to be something greater than himself.
Neumann's experience on a kibbutz and McKelvey's growing up in a five-mother commune in Oregon have been cited as a reason the pair hit it off. McKelvey is an architect with the title of chief culture officer at WeWork.
Neumann, now a billionaire as the majority owner of We Company, also has said he thought money was the goal in life until he met his wife Rebekah, a cousin of actress Gwyneth Paltrow.
Formerly called chief brand director, Rebekah Neumann is referred to as a co-founder of WeWork. She is also a filmmaker and introduced Neumann to Kabbalah, a form of Jewish mysticism that has attracted celebrity followers. They have five children.
ELEVATING WORLD'S CONSCIOUSNESS
The early success of the shared workspace validated the global community Neumann envisioned where people can achieve more together than alone, or in the words of the company's famous mantra: ""to make a life, not just a living.""
Neumann arrived in New York in 2001 where he lived with his sister Adi, an Israeli model, and started a handful of businesses that failed, including women's shoes and a line of baby clothes with knee pads called Krawlers.
""When I came to New York I was angry about my history,"" Neumann told a luncheon at the New York Stock Exchange in June 2017, adding he learned that you don't deserve anything. ""I became happy. My past helped make who I am today,"" he said.
Neumann, described as key to setting WeWork's strategic direction and execution priorities in the IPO filing, can come off as a bit zany. In the 2016 blog post he said the future of cities would require a healthy mix of 70% magic and 30% logic.
The We Company also said in the filing that its mission is to elevate the world's consciousness and that as a community company it is committed to maximum global impact, a vision Neumann endorses."

DUBAI (Reuters) - The head of the United Arab Emirates' General Civil Aviation Authority said on Sunday he was not optimistic that the Boeing (N:BA) 737 MAX would return to operations this year and that the first quarter of 2020 was more likely. 
The 737 MAX has been grounded since March while Boeing updates flight control software at the center of two fatal crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia that together killed 346 people within a span of five months. 
 Boeing Co  is targeting regulator approval for the fixes in October, though the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration has said it does not have a firm time for the aircraft to be flying again. 
The GCAA will conduct its own assessment to allow the MAX to return to UAE airspace, rather than follow the FAA, Director General Said Mohammed al-Suwaidi told reporters in Dubai.
He said the GCAA would look at the FAA decision and that the UAE regulator had so far not seen details of Boeing's fixes. 
The FAA has traditionally taken the lead on certifying Boeing jets, though other regulators have indicated they would conduct their own analysis. 
UAE airline flydubai is one of the largest MAX customers, having ordered 250 of the fast-selling narrow-body jets.

It has not said when it expects the aircraft to be operational again. American Airlines (O:AAL) has canceled flights through Dec. 3, United Airlines (O:UAL) until Dec. 19 and Southwest Airlines Co (N:LUV) into early January.

The companies argued in a court filing that U.S. District Judge Dan Polster, who is hearing the case in a federal court in Cleveland, Ohio, had made statements in court indicating that he was not impartial in the case and improperly pushed the companies to settle without going to trial.
The companies said that Judge Polster had also made improper public comments about the case, including to reporters.
Opioids were involved in 400,000 overdose deaths from 1999 to 2017, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
In the filing, the companies noted that plaintiffs had sought $8 billion. Defendants in the case include McKesson Corp (N:MCK), AmerisourceBergen Corp (N:ABC),  Walgreen Co  (NASDAQ:WBA) and Walmart Inc (N:WMT).
""Defendants do not bring this motion lightly. Taken as a whole and viewed objectively, the record clearly demonstrates that recusal is necessary,"" the companies said in a court filing on Saturday.
In particular, the companies said that on Jan. 9, 2018, in the first hearing, Polster said that the country was in the grips of an ""opioid crisis,"" adding ""150 Americans are going to die today, just today, while we're meeting.""
""(E)veryone shares some of the responsibility, and no one has done enough to abate it,"" he said, including ""the manufacturers, the distributors, the pharmacies, the doctors, the federal government and state government, local governments (and) hospitals.
""My objective is to do something meaningful to abate this crisis,"" he said at the hearing, according to the filing.
The request for recusal comes days after Judge Polster approved the substance of a proposal by lawyers representing cities and counties suing drug companies over the U.S. opioid epidemic that would bring every state and municipality in the country into their settlement talks.
The proposal, part of litigation consolidating about 2,000 lawsuits against opioid manufacturers, retailers and others seeking damages for the epidemic, calls for creating a class of up to 3,000 counties and 30,000 cities, towns and villages that could vote on whether to accept any settlement the plaintiffs reach with the defendants.
Any proposed settlement would need to win support of at least 75 percent of class members to be approved."

The Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung cited a person with knowledge of the appointment as saying Duesmann will start as Audi chief on April 1.
It said BMW's board would discuss Duesmann's planned departure to Audi in the near future.
Wolfsburg-based VW is on the lookout for clean-engine expertise as it struggles to overcome an emissions scandal that originated in Audi's engine development department.
Audi's current CEO and VW board member Rupert Stadler was forced to step down temporarily after his arrest in June as part of an ongoing emissions investigation. VW is seeking to replenish its senior leadership while Stadler remains in custody.
VW had said in July that Duesmann will take up his new position as soon as he is able to do so. He will be the second high-profile defection from rival German carmaker BMW after the poaching of Herbert Diess in July 2015.
Duesmann's BMW contract runs until Sept. 30, 2019, and it would also have a non-compete clause that BMW board members are required to sign.
BMW had said that Duesmann had informed its chairman that he would not make himself available for an extension of his contract because of personal reasons."
155,By Investing.com,"<span>Sep 14, 2019 04:17AM ET</span>",3 Things Under the Radar This Week,"1. Shale Production Momentum to Continue
U.S. crude oil production remained at a very strong 12.4 million barrels per day last week, the Energy Information Administration said in its weekly report.
That’s up about 1.5 million bpd from the same period a year ago, with shale oil adding to strong U.S. output.
And shale supply will continue to rise, hitting 14.5 million bpd by 2030, according to research firm Rystad Energy.
“In the past decade, crude oil coming from shale patches such as the Permian in the U.S. has grown from a negligible contributor to an upstream behemoth, reshaping the industry and the oil market,” Rystad said in a note this week.
The 14.5 million bpd level is based on Rystad’s base-case price scenario of an average price for WTI of $55 per barrel in 2019, $54 in 2020 and 2021, and $57 in 2022.
At a flat $45 per barrel scenario, the firm sees a 2030 peak of 11.5 million bpd.
“Based on our analysis, the oil price would need to be as low as $42 per barrel WTI going forward for the 2030 U.S. (light tight oil) supply to be as low as EIA presents in their reference case,” Rystad product manager Sonia Mladá Passos said.
2. Value Stocks Reigned Supreme, but Sustained Rally Uncertain
Rotation, Rotation, Rotation.
Investors’ go-to plan to stay ahead of the boom and bust in markets saw value stocks make the list of fashionable investments this week, while high-swinging growth stocks got the boot.
The iShares Edge MSCI USA Value Factor ETF (NYSE:VLUE) jumped 4% for the week, while the iShares Edge MSCI USA Momentum Factor (NYSE:MTUM) dropped 2% this week.
In the hunt for value, investors scooped up the cheapest stocks boasting the lowest price-to-earnings ratios like JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) or Deere (NYSE:DE), while casting aside more expensive names like PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) and Adobe Systems (NASDAQ:ADBE).
With stocks ending the week within touching distance of all-time highs, the change in fortunes for value against momentum stocks suggests that investors may be growing nervous about frothy valuations, particularly in high-flying tech names, which have largely driven the broader market higher.
But calls for value stocks to put together a sustained run higher and steal momentum’s crown may be somewhat farfetched, as some doubted whether beaten-down value names in sectors such as energy and financials would need to show meaningful growth to keep prying investment dollars away from momentum stocks in sectors such as tech.
""This (value) trade can work for a while, but it is hard to see it lasting for a while unless those groups [(ike financials, energy and retail) really perform fundamentally,” Kari Firestone, Aureus Asset Management CEO, told CNBC.
3. What percent?
President Donald Trump continued to rail against his own Federal Reserve this week, calling them “boneheads” for not cutting rates to zero (or below).
But over in Africa, Zimbabwe’s central bank went the other way – big time.
The Zimbabwe central bank hiked its overnight borrowing rate to 70% from 50% as its currency plummeted on the heels of runaway inflation.
As the country faces a dearth of foreign investment following its introduction of the new Zimbabwe dollar in the middle of the year, its annual inflation rate has jumped into triple digits.
The inflation rate was officially 176% in June, lower than only Venezuela, according to Reuters. But analysts said the actual rate could be much higher now, particularly factoring in black market transactions.
The hope is the huge rate hike will stem the tide. 
“Since the abolishment of the multicurrency system and re-introduction of the Zimbabwe dollar in June 2019 as well as the upward reviewing of the Bank policy rate, the inflation pressures are expected to dissipate,” Central Bank Governor John Mangudya said in a monetary policy statement this month. “Both the annual and monthly inflation are expected to moderate over time.”"

Iger departed Apple's board the same day the company revealed new details about Apple TV+, a $4.99-per-month service that will launch on Nov. 1. Apple is spending billions in Hollywood to secure original programming for the service.
The monthly subscription price for Apple TV+ undercuts Disney, which earlier this year announced its own streaming service that will feature its iconic children's content and cost $6.99 per month. The Disney+ service will debut on Nov. 12.
Apple and Disney have long had a unique relationship among major American companies, dating back to when Apple co-founder Steve Jobs became a Disney director and major shareholder when the entertainment giant bought Pixar, the digital animation studio majority owned by Jobs. Iger became an Apple director shortly after Jobs' death in 2011.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A federal appeals court on Friday revived a lawsuit against Fox News Network over its reporting on Seth Rich, a former Democratic National Committee employee whose unsolved murder sparked uncorroborated right-wing conspiracy theories.
The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan said Rich's parents, Joel and Mary Rich, could sue Fox News for causing emotional distress by publishing a May 16, 2017, article claiming their son had leaked DNC emails to WikiLeaks, implying that the leaks were related to his death.
Fox News, a unit of Fox Corp, retracted the article a week later, saying it fell short of its standards, but some leading conservatives and on-air guests discussed it for months.
The leaked emails suggested that DNC officials favored Hillary Clinton over Bernie Sanders in the 2016 Democratic presidential nominating campaign.
Circuit Judge Guido Calabresi wrote that the Riches ""sufficiently pleaded extreme and outrageous conduct"" by the defendants, including reporter Malia Zimmerman, who wrote the retracted article, and Fox News guest Ed Butowsky.
The 3-0 decision overturned an August 2018 dismissal by U.S. District Judge George Daniels in Manhattan, and returned the case to him.
Seth Rich, 27, was shot and killed in July 2016 near his Washington home, in what police there consider a botched robbery.
Fox News said in a statement on Friday that it offered the Rich family its ""deepest condolences for their loss,"" but believed legal proceedings would show it did not engage in conduct that supported the Riches' claims.
Asked about the decision, Butowsky, who is representing himself, said by phone: ""That's the craziest thing in the world. It has already been proven that the things they accused in the lawsuit never occurred.""
The Riches said in a statement that they looked forward to seeking justice, including at a possible trial.
""We would not wish what we have experienced upon any other parent,"" they added.
The couple, from Omaha, Nebraska, had said the campaign against them included their hiring, at Butowsky's suggestion, a private detective to investigate their son's death.
Zimmerman later cited the detective's findings in a discussion of Seth Rich's alleged contacts with WikiLeaks.
Calabresi said the reporter then lent credibility to those findings by emphasizing the detective's connection to the Riches.
""We have no trouble concluding that - taking their allegations as true - the Riches plausibly alleged what amounted to a campaign of emotional torture,"" Calabresi wrote.
The Riches claimed to suffer symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder and social anxiety disorder, and Mary Rich said she no longer feels comfortable in public.
Friday's decision also lets the Riches sue for alleged interference with their contract with the detective, and try to revive a negligent supervision claim against Fox News.
The case is Rich et al v Fox News Network LLC et al, 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 18-2321."

The government's growth forecast is part of its 2020 budget blueprint unveiled last weekend, which also slightly loosened a primary surplus target as the government aimed to balance big welfare promises with the reality of a stagnant economy.
""It's probable that our updated growth projections will be more conservative,"" S&P Global Ratings said in a statement, referring to the agency's upcoming forecast for the third quarter. 
S&P added that the government's estimates for financing requirements and a 2020 primary budget surplus are in line with its own expectations. But it said it sees a risk that the government's oil output forecast of 1.9 million barrels per day will not be met next year.
Current oil output, the vast majority of which is produced by state-owned Pemex, averages about 1.7 million barrels per day.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Apple Inc struck out at a  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS) analyst on Friday in a relatively rare public dust-up between a blue chip Wall Street firm and its client.
The disagreement came after Goldman Sachs analyst Rod Hall criticized Apple's accounting methods for the tech giant's new TV+ product, saying in a research note that it may result in lower gross margins and profits.
In response, Apple said it does ""not expect the introduction of Apple TV+, including the accounting treatment for the service, to have a material impact on our financial results.""
A Goldman spokeswoman declined to comment or to make the analyst available for interview. Apple also declined to comment on the Goldman relationship beyond its comment on the note.
While research departments at large Wall Street banks have Chinese walls separating them from other functions, the rare public dispute is an awkward moment between the two companies.
Goldman Sachs has underwritten more bond issuances for Apple in the last decade than any other investment bank, worth some $44 billion, according to financial data provider Refinitiv.
Goldman Sachs also advised Apple on mergers and acquisitions as recently as two months ago, guiding it through its $1 billion deal to acquire the majority of Intel's smartphone modem business, according to Refinitiv.
And just last month, the two worked together to launch both companies' first credit card -- the Apple Card.
Every bank formally separates its equity research and investment bank divisions because of laws passed in the early 2000s that aimed to protect the independence of the equity analysts from investment bankers, who are often covering the same companies with different agendas.
Corporate clients usually respect the independence of the research division. When they don't, it gets a lot of attention.
In May last year, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Chief Executive Elon Musk refused to answer questions from analysts about the company's capital requirements, calling the questions ""boring"" and ""not cool"" during a conference call to discuss Tesla's performance. He later criticized several analysts directly for negative calls.
At the beginning of its fiscal year, Apple changed where it accounts for the value and costs of free services - like Apple Maps - and moved it into its services segment. Previously this was accounted for under the individual products.
In his note, Goldman's Hall said Apple was likely to treat TV+ subscriptions in a similar way, by accounting for it as a discounted bundle of a free service paired with a hardware purchase. Hall said that would result in Apple investors seeing lower average selling prices for iPhones and other Apple devices but faster growth in the company's services segment.
Many Apple investors have come to focus on growth in the services segment as the global smart phone market has stagnated, with Apple shares (NASDAQ:AAPL) rising this year despite year over year declines in iPhone sales for its most recent two quarters."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Music publishers have asked a federal judge to let them double their lawsuit against Peloton Interactive Inc to $300 million, saying the maker of stationary bicycles has streamed more than 2,000 workout videos used without permission.
The National Music Publishers' Association, a trade group, said on Friday that since suing Peloton in March for copyright infringement, publishers have found a trove of additional songs that the New York-based company knowingly and recklessly offered to customers without first getting required licenses.
These allegedly included songs from Adele, Beyonce, Ariana Grande, John Legend, Maroon 5, Meek Mill and Taylor Swift, as well as classics such as The Beatles' ""I Saw Her Standing There,"" Ray Charles' ""Georgia On My Mind"" and The Who's ""I Can See For Miles."" Publishers want to add 1,324 songs to their lawsuit, the trade group said.
""Peloton fully understood what the copyright law required, having entered licenses with certain other copyright holders, while trampling the rights of plaintiffs by using their musical works for free and without permission,"" the publishers said in a proposed amended complaint filed late on Thursday.
U.S. District Judge Denise Cote in Manhattan must grant approval before publishers can pursue their expanded case.
The proposed complaint was filed two days after Peloton said it planned to raise up to $1.33 billion in an initial public offering, by offering 46 million shares priced between $26 and $29 each.
Peloton said its platform could have been developed only through ""close collaboration"" with major labels and music publishers, among others.
""We will continue to defend ourselves against claims made in this matter and look forward to pursuing our counterclaims,"" the company said in an emailed statement.
In a Friday court filing, Peloton's lawyers asked Cote to schedule a conference to address the publishers' and NMPA's alleged failure to turn over documents relevant to its case, saying the parties had reached an ""impasse.""
Founded in 2012, Peloton sells stationary bicycles starting at $2,245, in packages requiring memberships to access live and on-demand classes from home. Unlimited access costs $39 a month.

The case is Downtown Music Publishing LLC et al v Peloton Interactive Inc, U.S. District Court, Southern (NYSE:SO) District of New York, No. 19-02426.

161,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 13, 2019 06:43PM ET</span>","With rate cut likely, market wonders how low Fed will go","By Lewis Krauskopf
NEW YORK (Reuters) - With U.S.-China trade tensions roiling markets, investors are counting on support for stocks coming from a Federal Reserve willing to keep cutting interest rates to help the U.S. economy avoid a severe downturn.
A quarter-point rate reduction is widely expected when the Fed issues its next policy statement on Wednesday, which would be the central bank's second such cut after lowering rates in July for the first time since 2008. That puts the greater focus on clues about how much further the Fed will go.
“If the Fed gives forward guidance that suggests less than what the market is thinking, then you will probably see markets sell off,"" said Jamie Cox, managing partner of Harris Financial Group in Richmond, Virginia. ""So long as the Fed plays along with what markets are pricing in...I think markets will be very stable.”
The Fed's 180-degree pivot from tightening monetary policy last year to easing it has helped drive the stock market's overall strong performance in 2019. The benchmark S&P 500 (SPX) has climbed 20% this year and is near all-time highs.
The central bank in July cited signs of a global slowdown, simmering U.S.-China trade tensions and a desire to boost too-low inflation as it lowered borrowing costs.
Markets are pricing in a near 90% probability that the Fed will shave another quarter point from its current overnight lending rate of 2.00% to 2.25%, according to the CME Group's FedWatch tool. There is a roughly 65% probability that the Fed makes at least one more quarter-point cut by the end of the year, according to FedWatch.
""The market is going to want to see a focus that we have a cut and there is likely more coming,"" said Keith Lerner, chief market strategist at SunTrust Advisory Services in Atlanta. ""They want to know that the Fed is vigilant and will act aggressively if needed.""
That raises the importance of the newest set of policymakers' rate-path projections - the so-called dot plot - that will be released along with the rate decision. UBS economists said in a note they expect that will shift lower overall for 2019, but project only two cuts total for the year, which could irk both investors and a U.S. president eager for a more aggressive posture.
President Donald Trump has frequently criticized the Fed for not cutting rates more swiftly and significantly, with the Fed chair he appointed, Jerome Powell, the primary target of his ire.
The European Central Bank's decision on Thursday to cut interest rates and restart a larger stimulus program could further pressure the Fed to cut rates, as the ECB's move stands to weaken the euro against the dollar and thereby drive up the price of U.S. exports - an issue that especially vexes Trump.
Powell, who will give a news conference after the central bank issues its statement, has made comments in the past that have shaken the market, including in July, when he said the bank's rate cut might not be the start of a lengthy easing campaign to shore up the economy.
""Every meeting has the ability for Jay Powell to say something that upsets markets a little bit,” said Arthur Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities Corp.
Powell ""has had enough practice to know that he does not want to move markets or make news,” he added.
Of the past eight easing cycles since 1981, four have been ""insurance"" cycles, when economic problems loom but the economy is not in a recession, while four were pre-recession cycles, according to research from Allianz (DE:ALVG) Global Investors.
One year into an easing cycle, the S&P 500 rose an average of 20.4% during insurance cycles, while the index fell an average of 10.2% during pre-recession cycles, according to Allianz.
""Historically, what they’re doing now, which is cutting rates in an economy that is not in a recession and not really in any imminent risk of a recession, has been positive for the stock market,"" said Mona Mahajan, U.S. investment strategist at Allianz.
The stock market overall has typically responded well to a second rate cut, which Wednesday's would be, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) rising an average of 20.3% one year later, according to Ned Davis Research. The weakest performance has come when the Fed tried and failed to prevent a recession.
The probability of a recession in the next 12 months is nearly 38%, its highest in about a decade, according to the New York Fed's recession indicator, which is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve. Last month, yields on two-year U.S. bonds exceeded those on 10-year notes, an inversion of the yield curve that is seen as an omen of recession.
An escalation in the U.S.-China tariff war is contributing to economic uncertainty and is top among concerns for stock investors. Late last month, a key speech from Powell was upstaged when Trump issued tweets that heightened trade tensions.
“I do think it’s important that the Fed helps ease financial conditions and helps reduce the probability of recession,"" SunTrust's Lerner said. ""If the tariff fight ratchets up more, then what the Fed does, the effect will be less."""
162,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 13, 2019 06:21PM ET</span>",Explainer: One possible culprit in vaping lung illnesses - 'Dank Vapes',"By Chris Kirkham and Jeffrey Dastin
(Reuters) - As U.S health officials scramble to identify the root cause of hundreds of severe lung illnesses tied to vaping, one possible culprit identified so far is a line of illicit marijuana vape products sold under the brand names ""Dank Vapes"" and ""Chronic Carts.""
A study published last week in the New England Journal of Medicine found that more than half of patients with the lung illness - 24 of 41 - who were extensively interviewed in Wisconsin and Illinois reported having used the ""Dank Vapes"" brand.
The New York State Department of Health identified ""Dank Vapes"" and ""Chronic Carts"" as products containing Vitamin E acetate, a thickening agent in THC oil that has been a key focus in its investigation into the illnesses. THC is the psychoactive compound in cannabis.
While Vitamin E acetate is often applied to skin or used as a dietary supplement, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has warned against inhalation because ""data is limited about its effects"" on the lungs. The agency has advised consumers to avoid vaping THC oils or using devices bought outside of stores.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which is investigating 380 confirmed or probable cases of lung illnesses tied to vaping, said the condition has not definitively been linked to a specific product or ingredient, including Vitamin E acetate.
The CDC advises against using any e-cigarette or vaping products, since most of the patients interviewed used both THC and nicotine liquids, while 20 percent used only nicotine.
Leading makers of nicotine e-cigarettes, including Juul Labs Inc,  British American Tobacco  Plc (L:BATS) and Imperial Brands Plc (L:IMB), said this week their products do not contain Vitamin E compounds or THC.
AVAILABLE ONLINE
Packaging using the ""Dank Vapes"" name until recently was available on Amazon, according to caches of the product links, and a Reuters review shows they are still widely available elsewhere on the Internet.
Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) said it took down vape paraphernalia this week in line with its policies, though the company did not specify the exact products it removed.  It said THC and e-cigarettes were not, and are not, offered on its platform.
One merchant that appeared to sell packaging for Dank Vapes and another brand on Amazon was known as Cart Essentials, according to the cached links, which are now defunct.
Cart Essentials had 39 ratings this year, almost all of them five stars. The merchant did not immediately respond to a request for comment sent via Amazon's platform, and Reuters could not determine who was behind the company.
WHAT IS IT?
Marijuana extracts used in vaping ""pens"" have been one of the fastest-growing segments of the cannabis industry in recent years. It is an easy way to use the product, can be concealed, and users can better control how much they take in, said David Downs, California bureau chief for cannabis website Leafly.com.
The category grew from 2% of the legal market in 2014 to 16% last year, according to BDS Analytics, an industry tracker.
The ""Dank Vapes"" brand is an illicit product that uses diluted THC oil, Downs said.
Drug dealers, looking to make as much money as possible,  cut THC oil with Vitamin E acetate to dilute it but make it still appear pure to consumers, Downs said. ""It can cut THC oil while keeping it thick.""
It is difficult to determine whether ""Dank Vapes"" is an actual company or a brand used by multiple operators. No one responded to calls and emails sent to numbers and addresses listed on a website, dankvapes.org.
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo directed the state health department earlier this week to subpoena three companies he said market Vitamin E acetate to vape oil manufacturers. The three companies are Honey Cut Labs LLC in Santa Monica, California; Floraplex Terpenes in Ypsilanti, Michigan; and Mass Terpenes in Amherst, Massachusetts. 
Cuomo's office in a statement said the thickeners were being marketed as a ""cheaper, safer alternative that does not negatively impact flavoring or odor"" and ""can be used to cut vape products to any level of THC.""
Honey Cut and Mass Terpenes could not be reached for comment. Floraplex said in a statement it will ""work with all appropriate governmental agencies in a transparent and constructive way,"" and continue its ""distribution of quality products.""
The mass-terpenes.com website had a message to customers saying it was ""alarmed"" by reports that Vitamin E acetate had been linked to serious lung problems and will ""cooperate fully"" with state and federal health authorities. It added that the company has taken steps to ensure the website has no products containing Vitamin E acetate.
DISTINCT FROM AN 'E-CIGARETTE’  
Illicit THC vaping pens or similar devices are distinct from e-cigarettes, such as those made by Juul Labs, which vaporize a nicotine-filled liquid.
Nicotine, the addictive ingredient in cigarettes and other tobacco products, can cause serious problems for brain development in adolescents. The liquid generally also contains propylene glycol, vegetable glycerin and flavorings.
Juul says that research it sponsored found that smokers who switched to its product for a few days had far less exposure to certain harmful compounds in cigarettes. But the long-term health effects of inhaling aerosol with these ingredients remain largely unknown, and studies have indicated potential risks for cardiovascular disease and lung health.
While e-cigarettes are marketed as a means to help smokers quit or cut down, U.S health officials are concerned they are drawing a new generation into nicotine addiction."
163,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 13, 2019 06:08PM ET</span>",Exclusive: WeWork considers dramatic valuation cut in IPO,"By Joshua Franklin, Anirban Sen and Jessica DiNapoli
(Reuters) - WeWork owner The We Company may seek a valuation in its upcoming initial public offering of between $10 billion and $12 billion, a dramatic discount to the $47 billion valuation it achieved in January, people familiar with the matter said on Friday.
Were the We Company to press on with the IPO at such a low valuation, it would represent a major turning point in the venture capital industry's growth over the last decade, which has led to the rise of startups such as Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc,  Snap Inc  (NYSE:SNAP) and Airbnb Inc.
It would mean that the We Company would be at valued less than the $12.8 billion in equity it has raised since it was founded in 2010, according to data provider Crunchbase. And it would be a blow to its biggest backer, Japan's SoftBank Group Corp, at a time it is trying to amass $108 billion from investors for its second Vision Fund. 
The sources cautioned that no decision has been made and asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential. WeWork and SoftBank did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The We Company is under pressure to proceed with the IPO, despite the big valuation drop, to secure funding for its operations. It rents out workspace to clients under short-term contracts, even though it pays rent for them itself under long-term leases.
Investors have expressed concerns about the U.S. office-sharing start-up's business model, which relies on a mix of long-term liabilities and short-term revenue, raising questions about how it would weather an economic downturn. 
The We Company's deliberations indicate it does not feel confident that the corporate governance changes it unveiled on Friday, slightly loosening CEO and co-founder Adam Neumann's grip on the company, will be enough to woo investors concerned about its lack of a path to profitability.
The WeWork brand is strongly tied to Neumann, a flamboyant, freewheeling 40-year-old Israel-born entrepreneur who has said that the We Company's mission is ""to elevate the world's consciousness."" His wife, Rebekah Neumann, serves as the chief brand officer and is a powerful figure inside the company.
The We Company's corporate governance changes are largely symbolic, aimed at showing the We Company is listening to investors after being forced to slash its IPO price expectations, corporate governance experts said. Last month, it was considering an IPO valuation of around $20 billion.
""That change is seemingly cosmetic in nature,"" said Charles Elson, a professor of corporate governance at the University of Delaware, referring to the We Company's announcement it will reduce Neumann's voting power. ""He will still control the composition of the board.""
The office space sharing startup said it was making the changes ""in response to market feedback."" It said Neumann's superior voting shares will decrease to 10 votes per share from 20, though he will retain majority control of the company. 
Neumann will also give the company any profit he receives from real estate deals he has entered in to with We Company. He will also limit his ability to sell shares in the second and third years after the IPO to no more than 10% of his stock.
No member of Neumann's family will be on the company's board and any successor will be selected by the board, scrapping a plan for his wife and co-founder, Rebekah Neumann, to help pick the successor.
The We Company also disclosed it will list shares on the Nasdaq Stock Exchange. It plans to complete the IPO this month, and its IPO investor roadshow could launch as early as next week, Reuters has reported. 
This is the second effort to repair damage done to the company's image among investors. Earlier this month, it added a new member, Frances Frei, to its all-male board and said Neumann would return a $5.9 million payment for use of the trademarked word ""We."" 
""For all the attention being given to 'governance reform' at the We Company, entrenchment through unequal voting rights remains firmly in place,"" said Glenn Davis, director of research at the Council of Institutional Investors.
TUSSLE WITH SOFTBANK
SoftBank chief Masayoshi Son has been pushing Neumann to delay the We Company's IPO, but has so far failed to persuade him, Reuters has previously reported.
Were the We Company to delay its IPO, it would have to find debt financing to replace a $6 billion loan package it clinched from banks last month. This debt deal is contingent on the We Company raising at least $3 billion in its IPO.
Talks were ongoing on Friday between Neumann and Son about whether SoftBank would participate in the We Company's IPO, with no decision yet taken, one of the sources said. The Wall Street Journal reported earlier on Friday that SoftBank was considering spending at least $750 million to buy shares in the IPO. 

The last time SoftBank invested in the We Company was in January at a $47 billion valuation, injecting $2 billion of cash in the New York-based startup.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A New Jersey-based brokerage will pay $13 million to settle charges that it failed to supervise employee conduct during telephone trades and made false or misleading statements to a regulator, the U.S. Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) said on Friday.
Tullett Prebon Americas, Inc. did not admit to or deny the regulator's charges, the CFTC said, but agreed to pay the fine and to implement new software to monitor trades brokered by its trading desk.
It also agreed to enhance its review of ""voice-brokering,"" including a random review process.
The Tullett brokers' practice involved receiving bids and offers from customers who then communicate those bids and offers to other Tullett customers, the CFTC said.
While the firm had measures in place to discourage the miscommunication of trades, in 2011 an employee raised concerns to Tullett's compliance team about certain brokers who were violating the measure, which the firm ignored, the CFTC said.
The case comes as financial regulators seek to crack down on manipulative behavior within firms it oversees.
""The CFTC is devoted to ensuring price transparency and competition in all markets, whether electronically traded futures contracts or voice-brokered swaps,"" said James McDonald, the CFTC's enforcement director.
Tullett agreed to pay an $11 million civil monetary penalty and to cease and desist from violating CFTC regulations, the agency said. It will also pay a $2 million civil monetary penalty for making false or misleading statements to the regulator during its investigation."

The market's performance suggested some confidence. The S&P 500 finished down 0.07%. The Dow was up 0.14% for its eighth-straight gain. The Nasdaq Composite was off 0.22%, with the Nasdaq 100 Index down 0.31%. And losses trimmed by the close.
Meanwhile, September is proving a good month for stocks overall, potentially the best September since 2010. The S&P 500 is up 2.77%, with the Dow up 3.1% and the Nasdaq 2.69%. 
With the close, the averages were near all-time highs. The S&P 500 was off 0.68% from its all-time high of 3,027.98, reached July 26. The Dow off 0.65% and the Nasdaq 1.95% away.
Weakness in big tech stocks, including chipmaker Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) pulled both Nasdaq indexes modestly lower. And about half the Nasdaq-100 stocks were higher.
Apple regained some ground after challenging a Goldman Sachs assertion that Apple's pricing plans for its Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) TV+ service could hurt earnings. No, Apple said in a comment sent to CNBC, it won't affect results at all.
But bank stocks generally had a strong day. JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) rose nearly 2% and hit a 52-week high of $120.40.   Morgan Stanley   (NYSE:MS) jumped 1.9%. Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) finished up 1.69%.   Citigroup   (NYSE:C) was up 1.57%, and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) added 0.53%.
The fuel was rising interest rates. The 10-Year Treasury yield rose to 1.899% on Friday, up from 1.791% on Thursday and an intraday low of 1.452% on Sept. 4. The yield is still down 29% from Dec. 31.
The catalyst that's helped stocks this month is still in place: a thawing in the trade tensions between the United States and China. The U.S. agreed to delay imposition of new tariffs for two weeks. China said it would buy soybeans and pork products and not impose scheduled tariffs on those U.S. products. Officials from both countries are set to meet in Washington next month.
But a new question mark will challenge markets next week. Will the Federal Reserve cut interest rates after its two-day meeting? The decision will be announced Wednesday afternoon.
Because of this week's interest-rate rise, most analysts expect the Fed to cut its federal funds rate to 1.75% to 2% from 2% to 2.25%. But Investing.com's Fed Rate Monitor Tool put the odds on Friday for that at 78.5%, down from 90% Thursday and a week ago.
President Donald Trump, worried in part about the 2020 election, wants the Fed to cut rates substantially, perhaps even to zero. 
Meanwhile, gold and oil prices slipped on Friday and ended the week lower. 
The week saw the major averages rise roughly 1% across the board. 
Despite lower oil prices,   Cimarex Energy   (NYSE:XEC) and   Pioneer Natural Resources   (NYSE:PXD), plus Freeport-McMoran Copper & Gold (NYSE:FCX) and DuPont (NYSE:DD), were among the top S&P 500 performers.

166,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 13, 2019 05:36PM ET</span>",First peanut allergy therapy gets backing from U.S. regulators' expert advisers,"By Tamara Mathias and Saumya Joseph
(Reuters) - A U.S. Food and Drug Administration advisory panel on Friday recommended approving the first therapy for peanut allergies, which affect over 1.6 million children in the United States, despite raising concerns about the risk of severe allergic reactions it poses to young patients.
The body of independent advisers voted 7-2 in favor of effectiveness and 8-1 backing safety of the therapy Palforzia, developed by  Aimmune Therapeutics Inc  (O:AIMT). The verdict of the panel is traditionally an influential factor in the agency's final decision.
Peanut allergies are the leading cause of death from food-induced allergic reactions in the United States but a lack of approved preventive treatments has left patients and caregivers desperate for options.
Palforzia, previously known as AR101, is an oral immunotherapy consisting of fixed doses of powdered peanut that is sprinkled over food daily.
While it does not aim to cure peanut allergy, the treatment's clinical trials have shown that patients consuming small doses of the substance to which they are allergic become desensitized over time, reducing the likelihood or severity of a reaction to it.
Aimmune says extended therapy will result in patients tolerating at least one peanut's worth of the protein which causes the anaphylactic reaction, protecting them from accidental consumption of the food.
Industry projections suggest that, if a number of treatments in development are approved, by 2027 the U.S. peanut allergy therapy market could be worth $3.9 billion, with Aimmune capturing about two-thirds of that market, according to research firm GlobalData.
Patient advocacy groups have been keenly awaiting an FDA greenlight, which would offer the hope of relief to parents living in constant fear of their children being accidentally exposed.
While some allergy specialists in the United States provide non-approved versions of oral immununotherapy, analysts say Aimmune's more precisely dosed oral drug could bring in more than $1 billion in annual sales at its peak.
""It would be comforting for our community to have this option,"" Kenneth Mendez, who heads patient group Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America, told Reuters ahead of the panel meeting.
However, some experts worry that the treatment might give patients a false sense of security and trigger risky behavior. Others say it puts patients at unnecessary risk, because the very nature of the drug poses a risk of an allergic reaction.
Dr. Robert Wood, director of pediatric allergy and immunology at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, says he believes the excitement will be tempered when patients realize what being on therapy involves.
""I will offer the treatment to all patients and recommend it to no one,"" he said.
FDA representative Sofia Chaudhry told the panel on Friday that the agency was still deciding on what safety restrictions or ""REMS"" requirements to place on the drug.
""We do take a very conservative approach,"" she said.
If approved, Palforzia is expected to have a black box warning, the FDA's harshest, and strict restrictions requiring the therapy to be administered in a certified facility.
Aimmune's closest rival, France's  DBV Technologies  SA (O:DBVT), is developing a patch for peanut-allergic patients aged 4 to 11. The company last month resubmitted an application to the FDA for its stick-on patch therapy called Viaskin Peanut.
Aimmune hopes to win approval for use of Palforzia in patients aged 4 to 17 and said it is considering a list price range of between $3,000 and $20,000 a year.
""I think we'll be lower than in the middle (of that range),"" Chief Executive Officer Jayson Dallas told Reuters in an interview ahead of the meeting.
""Insurers will cover this. We've spoken to the insurers so far who cover about 70% of the lives of patients with peanut allergies.""
Earlier this year, pharmacy benefits manager CVS Health Corp (N:CVS) put out a blog on its website about new treatments, saying it was considering what type of patient access policy to put in place.
The FDA is expected to make a decision on approval early next year."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The S&P 500 ended the day down slightly on Friday but less than 1% below its all-time high as a drop in Apple stock countered cooling U.S.-China trade tensions. 
Tariff-vulnerable industrials helped keep the blue-chip Dow in positive territory, which has now gained in eight straight sessions, its longest winning streak since May 2018.
All three major U.S. stock indexes posted their third straight weekly gains, capping a week that saw signs of a potential thaw in the trade war between the world's two largest economies, which has gripped markets for months.
Apple Inc (O:AAPL) was the biggest drag on the major stock averages, falling 1.9% after Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) cut its price target for the iPhone maker's shares.
Beijing announced it would exempt some U.S. agricultural products from additional tariffs after President Donald Trump suggested he could be open to an interim deal, the latest conciliatory gestures by both sides of the trade war ahead of next month's negotiations in Washington.
""Apple is holding back the averages,"" said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities in New York. ""Another factor is we have a huge rally in (Treasury) yields, the 10-year is up substantially. Those two factors are holding back the market and dampening the enthusiasm that some kind of cosmetic trade deal is on its way.""
However, rising Treasury yields did boost interest-rate sensitive financials (SPSY), which gained 0.8%.
On the economic front, U.S. retail sales increased in August at twice the rate analysts expected, according to the Commerce Department, suggesting that strong consumer spending will continue to support the longest-ever U.S. economic expansion.
""The consumer is pretty cheerful,"" Cardillo added. ""Going into the holiday season the consumer is likely to continue to spend, and that bodes well as far as the consumer-led economy is concerned."" 
Ebbing trade jitters and upbeat retail sales data helped U.S. Treasury yields reach multi-week highs, providing an attractive alternative to risk-averse investors.
Market participants now look to the U.S. Federal Reserve, which is widely expected to cut interest rates by 25 basis points at the conclusion of its monetary policy meeting next week.

RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro telephoned Economy Minister Paulo Guedes from hospital this week to express his opposition to the creation of a new ""CPMF"" financial transactions tax, Guedes said on Friday.
In a wide-ranging interview with foreign journalists in Rio de Janeiro, however, Guedes again defended the idea, saying transaction taxes would allow for reductions in other levies such as income tax and value-added tax.
Guedes also said the government's economic reforms could help the economy to grow by 2.5% next year, privatizations this year will reach the 80 billion reais ($20 bln) goal, and the process of asset sales will be accelerated next year.
The implementation of a new version of the unpopular CPMF tax, which was abolished in 2007, has in recent weeks emerged as the central and most controversial element of the government's ambitious plans to reform the country's complex tax system.
A key economy ministry official involved in drafting the proposals was fired this week over the issue. Guedes on Friday repeated his support for the idea, yet acknowledged the president does not back it at all.
""We were in the process of modeling a financial transaction tax, but the president was always against it and asked not to,"" Guedes told foreign media in Rio de Janeiro, adding that Bolsonaro called from hospital in Sao Paulo, where he is recovering from a hernia operation.
Guedes confirmed that he and his team were working on a CPMF rate of 0.4% on transactions. But appearing irritated, he said the numbers should not have been made public, a reference to special federal revenue service secretary Marcos Cintra's dismissal this week.
Guedes said tax reform drive will include a new ""value-added tax"" at the federal level, which states and municipalities can opt into, and said he and Bolsonaro were ""100%"" together on the need to maintain the government's spending cap rule, which limits public spending increases to the rate of inflation."

An even bigger struggle looms.
The settlement with insurance carriers and investors puts to rest a dispute with a group holding about 85% of insurance claims PG&E faces from deadly blazes in 2017 and 2018. The coalition, which includes Seth Klarman’s Baupost Group LLC, had sought to wrest control of PG&E’s bankruptcy by presenting its own reorganization plan.
PG&E shares climbed as much as 10% on news of the agreement, which still needs approval from the bankruptcy court.
While the move is a step forward for PG&E, the utility faces an even more crucial negotiation with thousands of wildfire victims who lost homes, businesses or loved ones and claim they’re owed about $40 billion. PG&E has proposed capping those payouts at $8.4 billion. A spokesman for the fire victims blasted the utility’s settlement with insurance companies.
“This is just a blatant move on their part to help wealthy hedge funds and Wall Street,” Patrick McCallum, co-chair of Up From the Ashes, a wildfire victims group. “They are more worried about their stock price and the hedge funds that hold their stock than the victims.”
The claims for individual fire victims are pending in state and federal and court. They could take months to resolve.
A PG&E spokeswoman said the settlement is “another step” toward honoring its commitments to those affected by wildfires. “We remain committed to working with the individual plaintiffs to fairly and reasonably resolve their claims and will continue to work to do so,’’ PG&E spokeswoman Lynsey Paulo said.
PG&E filed for Chapter 11 in January, facing billions of dollars in liabilities from wildfires blamed on the company’s equipment that devastated parts of Northern California in 2017 and 2018. They killed more than 100 people and destroyed tens of thousands of structures.
The $11 billion PG&E is agreeing to pay the insurance companies includes liabilities from the deadly 2017 Tubbs Fire that raged in California Wine Country, a utility spokeswoman said. The total settlement exceeds the $8.5 billion PG&E proposed for insurance claims in the reorganization plan it filed this week. The company now plans to file a revised plan with the bankruptcy court.
The deal is apt to strengthen PG&E’s control over its bankruptcy, said Negisa Balluku, a Bloomberg Intelligence litigation analyst. “The settlement, however, leaves open questions of wildfire victim recoveries,” she said in a research note.
What Bloomberg Intelligence Says
“PG&E’s newly announced $11 billion settlement with a group of insurance subrogation claimants, which includes Baupost Group, likely bolsters the utility’s grip on the reorganization process.”-- Negisa Balluku, litigation analystClick here to view the research
The group of insurance carriers and investors claim that PG&E owes them a total of $20 billion. In a statement, the group said that it “hopes this compromise will pave the way for a plan of reorganization that allows PG&E to fairly compensate all victims and emerge from Chapter 11 by the June 2020 legislative deadline.”
Baupost stands to gain at least $570 million from the settlement. In November, the firm bought $1 billion in legal claims insurers held against PG&E, paying about 35 cents on the dollar, people familiar with the matter said. The settlement Friday implies a payout of roughly 55 cents on the dollar for Baupost, which is also PG&E’s third-largest shareholder.
The agreement is PG&E’s second major settlement of wildfire claims. In June, the company reached a $1 billion deal with 18 towns and other local governments to settle claims from blazes in 2015, 2017 and 2018."

The San Francisco-based solar developer is paying as much as 60% more for solar panels it’s using in the U.S., compared with costs for projects in other parts of the world, Smith said. The prices at which it can deliver electricity to utilities “could be lower without those tariff prices,” he said Friday in an interview at Bloomberg‘s offices in Washington.
And it’s not just the tariffs that were imposed on solar panels in 2018, he said. Duties on steel and inverters are also boosting installation costs. All that has become a drag on the U.S. solar industry, according to Smith. Lightsource is partly owned by  BP  (LON:BP) Plc.
“There’s going to be 10,000, 12,000 megawatts of solar built in the U.S. in 2019,” he said. “It could have been more without those tariffs.”
Smith stressed that even with the tariffs, solar is still an attractive, low-cost option for utilities and corporate buyers inking deals to buy it. “Solar energy is still being viewed in a lot of markets as the cheapest source of energy supply, and you win projects on that basis,” he said."

Parts of Florida remain on a tropical storm watch and will probably get heavy rain in any case. The system has maximum sustained winds near 30 mph (48 kilometers), just under tropical storm levels, and is barely moving at 1 mph, according to an 11 a.m. New York time report by the National Hurricane Center.
The system, located 289 miles east southeast of Grand Bahama Island, is forecast to strengthen within 48 hours, and a storm watch is intact from the Jupiter Inlet in Florida to the Flagler-Volusia county line. While the latest forecast sees Florida once again spared after a close miss by Dorian, forecasters say the path remains subject to change.
“The models have trended toward an out-to-sea solution and that seems to be the most viable solution,” said Jim Rouiller, chief meteorologist at the Energy Weather Group outside Philadelphia. “But there is always a ‘what if.’ If the timing is off with this trough then a more northward track could resume.”
Rouiller sees a low-pressure trough moving across the Northeast nudging the system out into the Atlantic.
For two days, the system has been sitting over the part of the Bahamas hit hardest by Dorian.
The island nation is still struggling to recover from that storm, which stalled over the Bahamas as a Category 5 hurricane with 180-mph winds. At least 50 people are confirmed dead from Dorian, hundreds are missing and the Abaco islands and Grand Bahama are devastated.
If the disturbance gets better organized and gains strength, it will be called Humberto, becoming the eighth storm named across the Atlantic in a season that’s been slightly more active than the average.
On Wednesday, the health minister for the Bahamas, Duane Sands, said teams of dog handlers from the U.S., Canada and Belgium are uncovering more and more dead bodies among the debris. In a nation where 80% of the land is less than 32 feet (10 meters) above sea level, people were confronted by “20 feet of ocean in their backyard,” Sands said.
The six-month Atlantic season reached its statistical peak on Sept. 10, with its most active phase lasting until early October. The season ends on Nov. 30."

It was a large payment, $185 million in principal alone, but the company, a real-estate firm called IRSA, had plenty of cash to cover it.When it turned over the money to the firm processing the payment, though, things got complicated. Under the new currency rules imposed by the government to try to staunch dollar outflows and stabilize the peso, the cash couldn’t be sent to creditors’ overseas accounts. As the payment was coming due Sept. 9, the firm, Clearstream, began releasing a series of statements confirming the money was, at least temporarily, frozen.All of which has added another layer of confusion and worry to markets in a country already paralyzed by a financial crisis that has the government on the cusp of default for the third time in the past 20 years. Among the most pressing questions traders and investors were grappling with Friday was whether this blocked payment was a technical glitch that the government would resolve soon or a more permanent feature of the controls that would imperil payments by other companies and the government itself in coming weeks.
For the time being, most observers seemed willing to wait the situation out, expecting that Argentine officials will quickly tweak the rules so as to avoid corporate bond defaults.
“Argentina doesn’t want an accidental default” and will fix the problem, said Siobhan Morden, the head of Latin America fixed income strategy at Amherst Pierpont Securities in New York.
An IRSA spokesman declined to comment.
Read More on Argentina’s History of Defaults
At this stage, it appears this snag in the payment chain will affect dollar bonds governed by local laws rather than foreign-law bonds where payments are made directly abroad. Companies, provinces and the federal government often sell both types of notes -- those that are subject to New York law and those under domestic regulations.
A central bank official, who asked not to be identified, said the capital controls announced this month do indeed limit these sorts of local transactions. Non-resident holders of local-law bonds need to be paid locally, and rules limiting overseas dollar transfers to $1,000 a month apply to them, the person said.
Amos Poncini, who holds the IRSA bond as a fund manager at CBH Compagnie Bancaire Helvetique SA in Geneva, said he feels burned by the delayed payout and said it reflects poorly on Argentina as a whole.
“Investors will fly away from there,” he wrote in an email.
IRSA depositary receipts dropped 4.8% to $5.60 in New York trading Friday, while its $71 million of notes due in July 2020 were little changed at about 86.8 cents on the dollar. Securities from oil producer YPF due in 2021 fell 2.1 cents to 82.7 cents on the dollar, while the government’s century bonds due in 2117 fell 1.8 cents to 41.7 cents on the dollar.
Of course the bond payment hiccup is only the latest in the list of recent disasters for Argentine investors. Assets have tumbled since an Aug. 11 primary vote showed the opposition was likely to unseat the business-friendly President Mauricio Macri in October elections. The peso has weakened almost 20% since the ballot, prices for the century bond fell by almost half and the Merval stock index lost 46% in dollar terms.
Capital controls are blunt instruments and frequently need to be revised as authorities discover surprise implications and loopholes, according to Dirk Willer, an analyst at  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C). Officials want to preserve the country’s foreign reserves, but likely want companies to be able to repay debts, he said.
“This is likely an unintended consequence of the controls and will likely be revised,” Willer wrote in a note to clients.

(Reuters) - Insurers of a fire-damaged Philadelphia refinery have indicated they would make a $50 million initial advance payment in connection with a June blaze that led to the plant’s closure, court documents showed.
The infusion of funds would buy cash-strapped Philadelphia Energy Solutions more time to navigate a Chapter 11 bankruptcy, which it filed for in late July, before being forced to liquidate.
PES entered bankruptcy exactly a month after a June 21 fire and series of blasts destroyed an alkylation unit at its massive refinery complex. Shortly after the blaze, the company requested an advance payment on $1.25 billion in property damage and business interruption insurance coverage, but it was denied.
In a court filing late on Thursday, attorneys for the company and its lenders said certain insurers “have expressed willingness to make an initial advance payment of $50 million” against property damage insurance proceeds connected to the fire.
The group is expected to make a formal entry of the stipulation and order involving the insurance payments on Friday, ahead of a Sept. 19 bankruptcy hearing, the court documents said. 
The refiner shut its last crude unit in late July and laid off nearly all of its 1,100 workers. A skeleton crew of about 80 union employees have been kept on for an indefinite period of time to continue winding down the plant and oversee cleanup from the June fire and explosions, which are still under investigation.
The company’s bankruptcy case hinges on receiving insurance proceeds for up to $1 billion for property damage and as much as $250 million for loss of business after the fire, according to earlier filings with the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware.
Without the payouts, PES could be forced into Chapter 7 liquidation."

SEATTLE/CHICAGO/PARIS (Reuters) - As  Boeing Co  (N:BA) sets its sights on winning approval to fly its 737 MAX within weeks, following a six-month safety ban, engineers around the world are rolling out plans for one of the biggest logistical operations in civil aviation history.
Inside Boeing's 737 factory at Renton, Washington, south of Seattle, workers have pre-assembled dedicated tool kits for technicians tasked with installing software updates and readying over 500 jets that have sat idle for months, insiders said.
Across the globe, Boeing teams are hammering out delivery schedules - and financial terms - with airline customers who have been forced to cancel flights, cut routes and fly aging jetliners while they await the MAX's return.
Although regulators must still approve the jets for flight, Boeing and airline staff and executives say the world's largest planemaker is weeks into an elaborate blueprint for production, maintenance and delivery that one source said involves 1,500 engineers - as many as it takes to design a small new jet.
Another likened the logistics to a nation ""going to war.""
Boeing Commercial Airplanes Chief Engineer John Hamilton called the previously unreported mobilization more like an elaborate ""ballet,"" which includes synchronizing 680 suppliers of everything from carbon brakes to pilot seatbelts.
Boeing will have to juggle the delivery of two different MAX categories: some 250 produced since the ban, parked at various facilities in tail-to-nose configurations that conjure the puzzle game Tetris; and those that will roll off the production line post-approval.
Airlines will mostly handle a third category involving the return to service of 387 aircraft flown before the grounding, though Boeing has already deployed teams around the world to help companies get ready for that process.
Boeing's fastest-selling jet was grounded in March after flight-control software was found to have played a role in two separate crashes that killed 346 people within five months.
The ban sent shockwaves through aviation, cutting Boeing's profit and margins, with a cost to Boeing so far estimated at $8 billion.
Redeploying hundreds of idle 737 MAX aircraft, which bring in an estimated 40% of Boeing's pre-tax profit, smoothly is crucial for the health of America's top corporate exporter and the country's wider manufacturing sector, whose recent loss of momentum has taken a further knock from the crisis.
Boeing receives much of its cash upon delivery and Fitch Ratings and Moody's have warned its ""stable"" outlook may be at risk, as its plane deliveries fall 72% this year.
Preparations for a return to service are finely tuned to the company's present assumption that the 737 MAX will resume commercial flights in the October-December timeframe, Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg told Reuters in August.
But the timeline is in the hands of divided regulators around the world who must approve Boeing's proposed software fix for 737 MAX flight controls and new training materials. European regulators plan their own test flights on the changes. 
""We don't control that timeline,"" Muilenburg said. ""We are going to work with the regulators and we are making progress towards that timeline. But if that return to service date changes, it affects everything else.""
Boeing has told suppliers that it expects the plane to be flying in early November, a senior industry source said.
LOGISTICAL GAME PLAN
Once regulators certify the MAX for flight, Boeing will have to mobilize hundreds of mechanics and pilots to bring the roughly 250 stored aircraft out of hibernation.
Airlines estimate the process - which includes installing new software, changing fluids and cycling the engines - will take 100 to 150 hours per jet, and months in total for Boeing.
In one example highlighting the minute risks that could upend months of planning, a team of employees is analyzing years of data on December snowfall at an airport in rural Moses Lake, Washington - where Boeing has parked some 100 jets - to predict demand for aircraft anti-freeze and runway performance.
The maintenance process will be followed several days of test flights as part of a standard customer acceptance period, but another challenge is finding enough pilots to work through the backlog.
As a result, Boeing is exploring a deal for temporary pilots with Isle of Man-based aircrew and training provider CCL Aviation to supplement its staff pilots, one person with knowledge of the matter said.
""Given the backlog of stored aircraft, that customer acceptance process could drag out,"" said Southwest Airlines Co (N:LUV) Chief Revenue Officer Andrew Watterson.
UNCERTAIN AVIATION MARKET
It's not clear which customers will receive deliveries first. Much will depend on how quickly other global regulators who have promised their own scrutiny follow the U.S. lead.
Some, like United Airlines (O:UAL), have said they want the jets as soon as possible, but others may use the opportunity to adjust deliveries. While airlines had been eager to add the fuel-saving models ahead of the peak northern hemisphere summer, fewer tend to add capacity in the quieter month of November.
The eventual MAX return will also test an increasingly fragile aviation market. Traffic growth has slipped since the grounding partly as a result of global trade tensions, according to the International Air Transport Association. 
Muilenburg has played down concerns about airline demand, telling a conference this week that the market remains robust.
But of 250 stored jets, about a dozen are bound for lessors that have yet to place them with airlines, or were built for now-bankrupt carriers like Jet Airways, industry sources said. 
Analysts say some airlines may try to use the grounding as a smokescreen to try to cancel orders, something Boeing would resist.
Boeing will nonetheless face conflicting demands over how fast airlines are now prepared to grow their fleets, said Rob Morris of UK-based aviation consultancy Ascend by Cirium. 

""Once the MAX logjam is broken ... there are a lot of aircraft that are potentially surplus,"" he added.

It is the second major settlement of wildfire claims by PG&E, and requires approval by the federal bankruptcy judge overseeing the utility's Chapter 11 case.
PG&E said proceedings on the third and final major group of wildfire claims remain pending in federal and state courts.
It said the latest settlement is related to payments made by insurers to individuals and businesses with coverage for wildfire damage.
Representatives of holders of 85% of so-called subrogation claims said the latest accord does not fully satisfy its $20 billion in claims, but would ""pave the way for a plan of reorganization that allows PG&E to fairly compensate all victims and emerge from Chapter 11 by the June 2020 legislative deadline.""
Subrogation allows insurers that pay policyholders for insured losses to recoup sums from third parties they deem responsible for them.
The company also amended its equity financing commitment agreements to accommodate the claims, and reaffirmed its $14 billion equity financing commitment target for its reorganization plan.
In June, PG&E agreed to pay $1 billion to resolve claims by 18 local public entities related to wildfires in 2015, 2017, and 2018.
On Monday, the company unveiled the outlines of a reorganization plan that would pay $17.9 billion for claims stemming from the wildfires that led to its bankruptcy in January.
At the time of its Chapter 11 filing, PG&E projected more than $30 billion in liabilities from wildfires, including last year's Camp Fire, the deadliest and most destructive wildfire of California's modern history.
The plan filed in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in San Francisco includes up to $8.4 billion for wildfire victims, payments capped at $8.5 billion for reimbursing insurers, and the $1 billion settlement with local governments.
On Tuesday, a lawyer representing wildfire victims called the $8.4 billion cap ""totally unacceptable"" because government agencies could have billions of dollars in claims, leaving far less than $8.4 billion for victims.

PG&E shares were up 7.8% in early afternoon trading, after earlier rising as much as 9.8%.

With Walt   Disney   (NYSE:DIS) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) are set to launch streaming services as soon as November, investors appeared to be uneasy about Netflix continuing its domination in the streaming world. But Piper Jaffray allayed fears, saying it expects the company will continue to capture a significant portion of traditional content dollars, as those dollars migrate to streaming.
Netflix rose 2.27% on the day (as of 1:20 p.m. ET) and is up more than 10% for the year so far. However, the shares are still nearly 24% below their 52-week high, a function of shedding more than a fifth of its gains after posting disappointing second results. The issue was meager subscriber additions that came in well below analysts’ estimates. 
But Piper believes subscriber growth will rebound in the third quarter, driven by an improved content slate in the second half of the year, forecasting third-quarter domestic subscription growth around 6.4% year over year and international growth in a range of 33% to 35%.
""There should be a positive impact from an improving slate and we are, therefore, optimistic about the company’s opportunity to grow subscriber additions year on year on a full-year basis,” Piper said.

182,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 13, 2019 01:00PM ET</span>",U.S. appeals court says Trump cannot dodge foreign corruption lawsuit,"By Andrew Chung and Jan Wolfe
NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. federal appeals court on Friday revived a lawsuit alleging President Donald Trump violated the U.S. Constitution by profiting from foreign and domestic officials who patronized his hotels and restaurants, moving a watchdog group closer to obtaining financial records from his real estate company. 
In a 2-1 ruling, a three-judge panel of the New York-based 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals set aside a lower court ruling that had thrown out the case because the people who sued could not prove they were harmed by Trump's actions and his role as president.
Friday's ruling dealt with preliminary questions relating to whether the case should be heard, without directly addressing whether Trump violated the law. 
The lawsuit, initially filed by plaintiffs including the watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, accused the Republican president of failing to disentangle himself from his hotels and other businesses, making him vulnerable to inducements by officials seeking to curry favor.
The case alleged violations of the U.S. Constitution's anti-corruption ""emoluments"" provisions, which ban the president from accepting gifts or payments from foreign governments without congressional consent.
Deepak Gupta, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, said the ruling puts them on track to subpoena financial records from Trump's business through the so-called ""discovery"" process.
The Justice Department, which is defending Trump in the case, could appeal the decision. 
A Justice Department spokeswoman declined to comment.
""If President Trump would like to avoid the case going further and curtail the serious harms caused by his unconstitutional conduct, now would be a good time to divest from his businesses and end his violations of the Emoluments Clauses of the Constitution,"" said CREW executive director Noah Bookbinder in a statement. 
Trump, a wealthy real estate developer who as president regularly visits his own hotels, resorts and golf clubs, maintains ownership of his businesses but has ceded day-to-day control to his sons. Critics have said that is not a sufficient safeguard.
Friday's ruling comes in a lawsuit filed days after Trump took office in January 2017. The plaintiffs included a New York hotel owner, an events booker in Washington and a restaurant trade group that allege lost patronage, wages and commissions from clients who now prefer Trump's businesses over theirs because of the ability to gain the president's favor.
The plaintiffs cite examples of foreign government entities, including the Embassy of Kuwait and a delegation from Malaysia, choosing Trump's properties, such as the Trump International Hotel in Washington, over other venues. 
The Justice Department had urged the appeals court to bury what it called a ""manufactured lawsuit"" because the plaintiffs cannot show that the harms they incurred can be traced to Trump's financial interest in his businesses rather than other reasons. 
Trump also faces a similar case brought by a group of more than 200 Democratic Party lawmakers. 

A third ""emoluments"" case, brought by the Democratic attorneys general of Maryland and the District of Columbia, was tossed by an appeals court in July.

184,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 13, 2019 12:35PM ET</span>","Fannie, Freddie regulator changes caps on multifamily loans","(Reuters) - The Federal Housing Finance Agency said on Friday it revised the limits on what  Fannie Mae  (PK:FNMA) and  Freddie Mac  (PK:FMCC) buy for their multifamily business into the end of 2020 in an effort to address a shortage in affordable housing.
Demand for apartments has surged in recent years mostly due to expensive single-family homes, and a lack of supply along the U.S. East and West coasts.
Lenders are expected to make $359 billion in multifamily mortgages in 2019, up from $339 billion in 2018. A decade ago, they lent $52 billion in the aftermath of the global credit crunch, according to data from the Mortgage Bankers Association.
The new multifamily loan purchase caps for the two government-sponsored enterprises will be $100 billion each for a total of $200 billion for the five-quarter period through the final quarter of 2020, FHFA said.
The new limits apply to all multifamily business with no exclusions, the regulator said.
""These new multifamily caps eliminate loopholes, provide ample support for the market without crowding out private capital, and significantly increase affordable housing support over previous levels,"" FHFA Director Mark Calabria said in a statement.
FHFA said at least 37.5% of the GSEs' multifamily business go into ""mission-driven, affordable housing.""
Loans that finance energy and water efficiency improvements will be considered conventional business, unless they meet other mission-driven affordability requirements, FHFA said.
The new caps compared with the existing ones which are $35 billion for each GSE with several exemptions, namely $23 billion for ""green"" improvements and $8.1 billion for affordable housing.
Between 2015 to 2017, the multifamily loan market grew about 14%, while Fannie and Freddie's growth in their purchases in this sector increased by 54%, FHFA said.
The two GSEs have been under government conservatorship since the global financial crisis. In 2017, they bought 49% of the annual multifamily loan supply, up from 36% two years earlier. 

“FHFA’s new cap structure recognizes the need to preserve liquidity in the multifamily market and the essential role we play in financing affordable apartment units,"" Debby Jenkins, head of Freddie Mac's multifamily business, said in a statement.

186,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 13, 2019 12:26PM ET</span>",Hong Kong exchange vows to press on with $39 billion LSE bid after rebuff,"By Huw Jones and Pamela Barbaglia
LONDON (Reuters) - Hong Kong's exchange refused to give up on its bid to take over the  London Stock Exchange  (L:LSE) after the British bourse emphatically rejected its $39 billion takeover offer on Friday.
The Hong Kong exchange said it would now hold more talks with LSE investors as it considers its next step, aiming to keep alive its hopes of becoming a more global player to rival U.S. giants ICE (N:ICE) and CME (O:CME).
""HKEX believes that shareholders in LSEG should have the opportunity to analyze in detail both transactions and will continue to engage with them,"" it said in a statement.
The LSE said earlier on Friday, as it rebuffed the Hong Kong approach, that it was sticking with its $27 billion acquisition of data and analytics company Refinitiv - a deal that the HKEX offer had required the London exchange to abandon.
It told HKEX in a letter that it had fundamental concerns about key aspects of its takeover proposal which it said had no strategic merit, and that HKEX's relationship with the Hong Kong government would ""complicate matters"".
HKEX's valuation of the LSE falls ""substantially short"" and the ""ongoing situation in Hong Kong"" adds to uncertainty for shareholders, the London bourse added, a reference to weeks of pro-democracy street protests in the former British colony.
""Accordingly, the board unanimously rejects the conditional proposal and, given its fundamental flaws, sees no merit in further engagement,"" the LSE said in a statement.
HKEX, Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HK:0388), said it was disappointed the LSE has refused to ""properly engage"" in a compelling proposal.
A source close to HKEX added the quick dismissal of the surprise offer, announced on Wednesday, meant the Hong Kong bourse had very little time to discuss their proposal with investors, a sentiment echoed by some shareholders.
""As shareholders in LSE, it's difficult to evaluate the merits of a combination with HKEX as we have been given no information on potential synergies,"" said James Bevan, chief investment officer at CCLA, which holds a small stake.
LSE shares, however, rose on the news of the offer rejection and closed up 2.73% at 7,450 pence.
LSE's blunt rejection letter said the Hong Kong offer did not meet its strategic objectives. It said it was sticking with its core strategy of expanding into data with the Refinitiv deal, rather than taking a ""significant backward step"" by bulking up on market transactions in the HKEX proposal.
The LSE also said a Hong Kong takeover could well be rejected by regulators or governments in Britain, the United States and Italy. HKEX's assertion that implementing the deal would be swift and certain ""is simply not credible"", it added.
The LSE also owns the Milan exchange and has a significant American presence through its FTSE Russell index subsidiary and LCH, its derivatives clearing house which dominates the U.S. dollar swap market.
HKEX added on Friday that it had held initial constructive discussions with regulators and policymakers. But a regulatory source in Britain said no substantive discussions had been held on the proposed deal so far.
HIGHER OR HOSTILE?
The flat rejection indicates HKEX boss Charles Li is unlikely to win the LSE board round with an improved financial offer, meaning he may have to go hostile if he wants to persist. He would need to launch a major charm offensive with investors to convince them the LSE board is wrong.
However a source close to the LSE said even if the cash component of HKEX's cash-and shares offer was raised, it would increase the risk for a combined group by piling on more leverage.
The source said a higher bid by the Hong Kong exchange or going hostile was unlikely to succeed because its proposal was ""just too weak on every fundamental point"".
A deal will be also challenging given the troubled history of big exchange mergers, combined with Hong Kong's current unrest.
The industry has been littered with attempts at cross-border tie-ups for over a decade as profits from the traditional business of running stock markets and clearing houses have fallen. But proposed deals have collapsed in the face of regulatory and political opposition to core parts of a country's financial system falling into foreign hands.
This has pushed exchanges to look for related businesses for growth, with the likes of LSE and New York Stock Exchange owner ICE driving into more profitable and less politically sensitive areas like data and analytics, where revenue is rising.
""This (rejection) certainly makes it clear that even if the HK exchange were to reconsider the terms of the transaction, it shows fundamentally the LSE board would prefer to go down the Refinitiv route,"" said Michael Werner, analyst at UBS.
HKEX made its offer just two days after its officials traveled to London to present it to LSE Chief Executive David Schwimmer for the first time. It has been coolly received by shareholders on both sides so far.
PROTESTS AND POLITICS
Analysts said a perception that Beijing is exerting growing influence over Hong Kong was a key sticking point for an LSE takeover, given the Hong Kong government's close links with the HKEX. The Hong Kong government is the biggest shareholder in HKEX, with a 6% stake and approves six of the 13 board members.
Hong Kong is entering a fourth month of sometimes violent protests sparked by legislation that would have drawn the former British colony closer to the Chinese legal system.
Fitch Ratings said, before the LSE's rejection of the offer, that ""increasing control by Chinese authorities over Hong Kong"" could raise regulatory concerns in Britain and the United States about data and information security.
HKEX, for its part, had touted the deal as providing London with a major gateway to the Chinese economy, but the LSE said HKEX did not provide the best long-term option.
""We value our mutually beneficial partnership with the Shanghai Stock Exchange which is our preferred and direct channel to access the many opportunities with China,"" the LSE said.
The LSE and Shanghai have recently launched a share trading link.
Earlier on Friday, ahead of the rejection, HKEX boss Li told Reuters that his proposal was one about boosting the long-term fortunes of both exchanges.
""Whoever can come up with a system that either allows money to go into China or allow the Chinese money to come out is going to really, really transform global financial markets."""

DETROIT (Reuters) - United Auto Workers (UAW) President Gary Jones and his predecessor are unnamed officials listed in a federal criminal complaint this week that detailed alleged corruption involving massive misuse of members' dues by the labor union's leaders, a source familiar with the matter said on Friday.
The complaint referred frequently to various unnamed figures, in particular ""Official A,"" who is Jones and ""Official B,"" his predecessor Dennis Williams (NYSE:WMB), the source said.
The news was originally reported by the Detroit News, citing three sources.
The federal complaint released Thursday detailed charges against Jones' former second in command and successor as head of the UAW's ""Region 5"" Vance Pearson.
The charges against Pearson came just two days before the UAW's contracts with Detroit automakers were due to expire.
UAW negotiators already faced contentious talks with General Motors Co (NYSE:GM), Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCA). The focus is on thorny issues like healthcare costs and profit-sharing at a time when U.S. new vehicle sales are declining.
But Saturday's contract deadline could be overshadowed by the latest revelations in a mushrooming corruption scandal, of vast sums being spent on lavish entertainment by labor leaders.
Neither Jones nor Williams have been charged with any wrongdoing. A UAW spokesman did not have an immediate comment on the report implicating Jones and Williams.
The union had hoped to put the federal probe behind it by electing Jones, a former regional director for the union, as president in 2018. However, Thursday's arrest implicated the second in command in the region Jones ran. 
Jones was chosen as he seemed far removed from the scandal. 
But two weeks ago, the FBI raided Jones's home, a union retreat and multiple other locations as part of the corruption probe.
The federal complaint filed on Thursday said government agents had seized $30,000 in cash from the residence of Official A.
An attorney for Jones could not be reached for comment after the charges were announced against Vance Pearson, Jones' successor as regional director.

But the union said on Thursday after the complaint was filed that it believed the government had ""misconstrued"" facts.

Stock funds globally attracted $14.4 billion on a net basis during the week through Sept. 11, the biggest inflow since March 2018, according to Bank of America (NYSE:BAC). and EPFR Global data. U.S. equities were the primary beneficiary of a renewed appetite for riskier investments, posting the 10th-biggest inflow on record at $17 billion.
In a reversal of this year’s trend of traders piling record amounts into bonds, government debt and Treasuries redemptions were the second-largest ever this week, with $6.1 billion leaving. Traders returned to stocks, hit by outflows of $198 billion since the start of 2019, on bets the European Central Bank and the U.S. Federal Reserve will announce fresh measures to reignite economic expansion.
“Like the 1927 New York Yankees batting lineup (‘those fellows not only beat you, they tear your heart out’), 2019 global policy makers are intent on reversing bearish Wall Street sentiment,” Bank of America strategists, led by Michael Hartnett, said in a note. “Since Wall Street is more than five times the size of Main Street, they have every incentive to do so to reverse recession risk, contagion from manufacturing and trade.”
‘Mind-Boggling’
Investor fund positioning was in line with Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) Private Wealth Management’s preference for U.S. stocks expressed earlier this week, with chief investment officer Sharmin Mossavar-Rahman calling this year’s historically large bond inflows “mind-boggling.” And  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Group AG’s wealth-management arm raised global equities to overweight from neutral Friday, citing trade deal optimism and monetary stimulus.
The day after the flows data were completed, the ECB cut its deposit rate to a record-low minus 0.5% and said it’ll buy 20 billion euros ($22 billion) a month of debt for as long as needed. After initially rallying on the news, European government bonds gave up their advance and stocks swung between gains and losses, with ING Bank NV calling the size of the QE program a “disappointment” and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) saying deposit tiering is “far from a panacea” for bank profits.
Investor attention in equity flows focused on passive funds, which added $23 billion, while $8.4 billion left mutual funds.
The Bank of America strategists said they’re bullish on risk assets in 2019 because of weak investor sentiment, but are bearish for 2020, forecasting a “bond bubble pop” and a peak in equities.
MSCI World Equity Index gained on Friday, poised for the third weekly advance, as optimism over a trade deal increases before expected high-level talks next month between the U.S. and China."

200,By Investing.com,"<span>Sep 13, 2019 08:35AM ET</span>","StockBeat: ""Count Draghila"" Sends Euro Bank Stocks Flying","By Geoffrey Smith
Investing.com -- Bank stocks led a charge higher by Europe’s markets on Friday, in a broad risk-on move that was also supported by hopes for some trade détente between the U.S. and China.
The ECB’s measures led to risk-free yields across the euro zone trending higher, something that helps the profits that banks make by accepting short-term money from depositors and the central bank and lending longer-term money to homeowners and businesses.
At the same time, although the package was less than many had expected, it avoided the impression that the ECB was completely powerless in the face of a trade war between China and the U.S. over which Europe has no control.
By 5:15 AM ET (0915 GMT), Spanish banks were at the top of the rankings, with Caixabank (MC:CABK) rising 5.0% and Banco de Sabadell (MC:SABE) rising 4.3%. Santander (MC:SAN), the country’s largest bank which gets most of its profits from the Americas, was up 2.3%. The laggards were those banks who have some of the highest excess reserves, notably the Netherlands’  ING Groep  (AS:INGA) and ABN AMRO (AS:ABNd) – both of whom have relatively strong balance sheets, by European standards.
Austrian banks Raiffeisen Bank International (VIE:RBIV) and   Erste Bank   (VIE:ERST) also underperformed after the country’s new central bank governor made clear he had dissented from Thursday’s actions.
The biggest beneficiaries on Thursday had been Italy’s banks, as the resumption of quantitative easing promises to lock in profits for them on their disproportionately large holdings of sovereign bonds. The recent installation of a new Italian government that is not threatening to break the EU’s budget rules had, of course, removed a key obstacle to the ECB resuming QE in the first place, neutering one of the (German-led) objections to fresh bond-buying.
Even so, it’s hard to argue that the ECB package on its own is going to be a game-changer for a sector whose returns remain crimped by high legacy costs, high capital requirements and structural challenges such as the rise of online financial platforms.
Nor has the bank’s latest interest rate cut made the political backdrop for more aggressive actions to turn the euro zone economy around any easier: German newspapers raged Friday at “Count Draghila, who sucks our bank accounts dry.”
The Stoxx 600 was up less than 0.1% at 390.54, on track for a fourth straight weekly gain; Spain’s IBEX 35 was up 0.4% and Italy’s FTSE MIB up 0.3%, while the FTSE 100 fell 0.3% as sterling surged again on confidence that a disorderly Brexit will be avoided. U.K. bank stocks, with their domestic focus, were among the biggest outperformers."

Nasdaq 100 futures rose 25 points or 0.3% by 6:45 AM ET (10:45 GMT), while Dow futures gained 101 points or 0.4% and S&P 500 futures were up 9 points or 0.3%.
China will exempt some agricultural products from more tariffs on U.S. goods, China’s official Xinhua News Agency said on Friday, the first substantial move by the Chinese side in some time.

202,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 13, 2019 08:18AM ET</span>","Shares, bond yields perch at six-week highs","By Marc Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - World shares climbed to a six-week high alongside benchmark government bond yields on Friday, as markets cheered signs of progress in U.S.-China trade talks and another powerful slug of stimulus from the European Central Bank.
It was a bit of a groggy start in Europe after it emerged that not all of the ECB's member country's had wanted to restart its money printing program.
But news that China would spare some U.S. agricultural goods from tariffs helped global stocks add 0.3% and lifted Wall Street futures too. 
The euro shuffled up to a two-week high as traders suspected the ECB may have now exhausted all ammunition of any worth, though a six-week low for the safe-haven Japanese yen and the pound back above $1.2450 for the first time since late July also caught the attention. 
""We have quite an interesting reaction to the ECB meeting with the sense of the pushback from the core countries, and that essentially that the ECB has now thrown its last cards in,"" said John Hardy, head of FX strategy at Saxo bank. 
""It looks like we are also getting to some pretty interesting levels for yields. If the consolidation continues, at some point you have to question whether the easing (from the central banks) is actually there.""
U.S., Japanese and European long-dated bond yields were all at six-week highs. Ten-year U.S. Treasuries were offering almost 1.8% compared with just over 1.4% at the start of September, while Germany's Bunds settled at the new ECB deposit rate of -0.5%.
It was all built on revived risk appetite and after U.S. President Donald Trump had said on Thursday he was potentially open to an interim trade deal with China, although he stressed an ""easy"" agreement would not be possible.
It would certainly help optimism in the near future though a new Reuters poll showed most economists believed the trade dispute would worsen or at best stay the same over the coming year.
In line with the main world stock indexes, Asian shares ended their week at a six-week high. Japan's Nikkei did even better and scored a 4-month peak, while Wall Street's S&P 500 had closed just short of its all-time closing high. 
As well as the boost from the Trump trade signals and the ECB's salvo of easing measures, sentiment had also been helped by a U.S. tax overhaul plan aimed at middle-income households next year. 
""Risk assets should find further support from accommodative policies, which are set to remain in vogue for some time, and not just in Europe as seen in the global easing trend,"" said Esty Dwek, head of global market strategy at Natixis in Geneva, Switzerland.
EASY! EASY!
U.S. Fed funds rate futures now imply a 0.25 percentage point interest rate cut by the U.S. central bank next week but have effectively priced out any chance of a larger cut. 
The Fed will announce its policy on Wednesday, followed by the Bank of Japan (BOJ) on Thursday.
Sources told Reuters the BOJ is leaning towards standing pat next week if markets are calm, but is brainstorming ways to deepen negative interest rates at minimal cost.
""I think a rally in stock prices will run out of steam soon. It's typical buy-on-rumour-sell-on-fact trade on central bank stimulus and will be over by the Fed and the BOJ's meetings,"" said Tatsushi Maeno, senior strategist at Okasan Asset Management.
Despite the rise in other economy-sensitive assets, oil prices were on course to post weekly losses.
As well as continued worries about weakening demand, traders have begun speculating that the U.S. may ease sanctions on Iran after Trump ousted his hawkish national security adviser John Bolton this week. 
Brent crude futures leveled out at $60.21 a barrel while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude hovered around $55. Gold ticked up to $1,503 an ounce.

Kone could bid for Thyssenkrupp's elevator division - which the ailing conglomerate has put up for sale - through a mix of cash and shares, which might give Thyssenkrupp a minority stake in the merged entity, people close to the deal have said.

204,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 13, 2019 08:14AM ET</span>","Deutsche Bank Gets Biggest Boost From Tiering, JPMorgan Says","(Bloomberg) --   Deutsche Bank   (DE:DBKGn) will benefit the most by far from the European Central Bank’s new tiered deposit rate, JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM). analysts led by Kian Abouhossein said Friday.
Germany’s largest lender stands to save roughly 200 million euros ($222 million) in annual interest payments thanks to a new rule that exempts a big chunk of the money it holds at the ECB from the negative rate the central bank charges on deposits. That’s equivalent to 10% of the pretax profit the analysts expect the bank to report in 2020, compared with an average of just 2.5% for the EU banks included in the analysis.
The ECB yesterday lowered its deposit rate by 10 basis points to -0.5% as it grapples with persistently low inflation and a weakening economic outlook in the euro area. Banks have said the move will make it even harder to improve their already low profitability. Deutsche Bank Chief Executive Officer Christian Sewing said last week that negative interest rates will “ruin the financial system” in the long run.
The second-biggest tiering beneficiary is Commerzbank (DE:CBKG), the analysts said in the report Friday. The bank is set to save about 100 million euros, or around 6% of its 2020 pretax profit. The total relief for the banking system is about 1.7 billion euros, they said.
The two German lenders are getting the biggest boost because they have a comparatively high level of ECB deposits that fall under the new rule. They also both have relatively weak profitability, meaning even a small amount of savings can significantly boost their bottom line.
“Banks would like to have positive rates, unquestionably,” Draghi said at the ECB’s press conference on Thursday. But profitability is much more affected by costs, and adapting to new technology would be “much more compelling than being angry about negative rates,” he said."
205,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 13, 2019 07:50AM ET</span>",Europe’s New Trade Team to Push Back on ‘Reckless’ Trump,"(Bloomberg) -- The European Union’s new leadership team has an old message for U.S. President Donald Trump on trade: cut out the unilateral and protectionist actions.
A week after the U.S. envoy to the EU called for a “reset” in transatlantic ties damaged by Trump’s multiple salvos against the World Trade Organization, European Commission President-elect Ursula von der Leyen vowed to defend the global open-market order underpinned by the WTO when she takes office in November.
“Europe’s place is at the heart of the rules-based multilateral system,” von der Leyen said in a mission letter Tuesday to Phil Hogan, whom she appointed as the EU’s next trade chief.
In an Irish radio interview on the same day, Hogan himself called Trump “reckless” and urged him to see the “error of his ways” in the U.S. trade war with China.
The comments highlight how the EU’s traditional inclination to accommodate its biggest trade partner on commercial questions has been replaced by a growing resolve to confront Washington over them since Trump took office in 2017 with an “America First” agenda.
During his presidency, Trump has outraged Europe by imposing tariffs on European steel and aluminum based on national-security grounds, threatened to do the same on EU automotive goods and brought the WTO’s much-prized arbitration system to the brink of paralysis.
The EU has hit U.S. products with duties as retaliation for the metal levies, vowed a similar reaction to any auto tariffs and come up with a makeshift system for settling disputes at the WTO.
While von der Leyen said in her letter to Hogan that he’ll need to work toward a “positive, balanced and mutually beneficial trading partnership with the United States,” she also highlighted the need for the EU to deepen commercial ties with China, Africa, Australia and New Zealand.
And, in a sign of the EU’s increased confidence when it comes to fashioning the global commercial order, von der Leyen said simply and bluntly: “The European Union is the world’s trading superpower.”"

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Police in India's capital New Delhi are probing a case of alleged tax evasion involving  Anheuser-Busch InBev  (BR:ABI), according to a police officer and a document seen by Reuters, a setback for the brewer already battling a three-year city ban.
Local authorities barred AB InBev, the world's largest brewer, in July from selling its beer in the high profile New Delhi market for evading taxes. The company has denied the allegations and appealed the order.
The Delhi ban followed an investigation by city authorities which found that beer maker SABMiller (LON:SAB) - acquired by AB InBev in 2016 for around $100 billion - used duplicate barcodes on its beer bottles supplied to city retailers that year, allowing it to pay lower taxes.
The Delhi government's ban order had also called for further action against the company and a local bar outlet for alleged violation of criminal law provisions such as conspiracy, cheating and forgery.
A senior Delhi police official, Anant Kumar Gunjan, told Reuters that officers have launched an investigation into the case after receiving a request from the city government, a move that could potentially lead to criminal charges. 
""We are investigating this, it is under inquiry,"" said Gunjan, adding that police would conduct its own probe before registering a formal case.
AB InBev told Reuters in a statement on Friday that it was aware of the ""potential for an additional authority to take interest in allegations"" raised in the Delhi government's ban order. 
""It would not be appropriate to comment further at this time. We are committed to operating with integrity and high ethical standards,"" a spokesman said, adding that the allegations dated back to 2016, before its takeover of SABMiller.
""BIGGER HEADACHE""
News of the police investigation will add to the company's woes in New Delhi, where it is already arguing against the ban order with city authorities and in court. Separately, AB InBev is also battling an Indian antitrust watchdog investigation concerning alleged beer price-fixing by SABMiller and others.
""The ban only has a financial impact, the police case could be a much bigger headache for the company and can have wider ramifications,"" said Sandeep Chilana, a New Delhi-based lawyer specializing in taxation and liquor laws.
The Delhi administration made a written request to police authorities last month to register a case, according to a government document dated Sept. 6, seen by Reuters on Friday. 
""Considering the gravity of the offense, it is opined that even a harsher and exemplary punishment (than the ban) ... would have also been justified in this case,"" the document said. 

AB InBev, which sells popular beer brands such as Budweiser and Hoegaarden, is the second biggest player in India's $7 billion beer market, accounting for a 17.5% market share, according to research firm IWSR Drinks Market Analysis.

BUENOS AIRES/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Argentina's stocks, which crashed last month to multi-year lows, are starting to lure in hardy investors tempted by bargain basement prices, even as the country teeters on the brink of default ahead of a general election next month.
The country's main stock index lost almost half its value in the weeks after a shock Aug. 11 primary election defeat dealt a crushing blow to market-friendly conservative President Mauricio Macri and also roiled the country's debt market and peso currency.
The S&P Merval Index (MERV) has since steadied, though it remains down by over a third, which bankers and brokers said was starting to attract investors hopeful that the environment would improve and valuations recover.
""We're gradually starting to see more inquiries from foreign investors,"" Christian Reos, Buenos Aires-based research manager at brokerage Allaria, told Reuters.
""The valuations of companies don't reflect their reality right now. Today they are at high risk because Argentine assets are very volatile, but looking at things in the medium term it's an opportunity to buy.""
The big question on investors' minds is what direction the country will move as the Oct. 27 presidential vote approaches. Macri was defeated by a landslide in the primaries by moderate, left-leaning Peronist Alberto Fernandez.
The result, which caught pollsters and politicians by surprise, hammered markets as investors feared Fernandez could usher in protectionist policies favored by his running mate, populist ex-President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner.

POLITICAL WINDS
Luiz Ribeiro, head of Latin American operations at asset manager DWS, which held onto its American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) in Argentina through the market plunge, said, however, he saw Fernandez taking a more pragmatic approach.
""We see markets pricing in the worst case scenario, which we do not see as the most likely,"" he explained, referring to the likelihood a Fernández government would be more moderate than some investors currently expect.    ""At the current prices we are not going to sell. We just need more signals from Alberto (Fernández) that he is really going in that direction and how he is going to get there, so that we can actually buy,"" he added.
Ribeiro said energy and financial companies could attract an initial wave of investment.
That could include Grupo Financiero Galicia (BA:GGAL) and oil company YPF (BA:YPFD), which is spearheading development in Argentina's huge Vaca Muerta shale formation.

TOLERANCE FOR RISK
Kathryn Rooney Vera, head of analysis and strategy for emerging markets at Miami-based securities brokerage Bulltick LLC, said U.S. clients had sought her advice on investing in Argentine stocks after the crash, highlighting the potential of Vaca Muerta as one of its attractions.
""For speculative investors willing to sit on something with value and see potential, it's an interesting time to look at the banking and energy sectors,"" Vera told Reuters, though she warned these were bets for people with a high tolerance for risk.
Juan Pablo Fuentes, economist at Moody's Analytics in Pennsylvania, added that investing in Argentine shares remained a gamble due to uncertainty about the economic policies Fernández will take if elected. 

""As much as (companies) have a healthy business plan and low debt levels, in the end the performance of companies will depend on the macroeconomic environment,"" he said. ""If that deteriorates, there are no firms - however healthy they may be - that they will be saved from the situation.""

DUBLIN (Reuters) - Malta has been sharply criticized by an influential European monitoring body for inadequately tackling financial crime, in a report highlighting the risks of its large banking and online gambling sectors.
The report, which in the past has been closely watched internationally including by U.S. Treasury officials, is a setback for the island that has sought to repair its reputation following the murder of a journalist investigating corruption.
Moneyval, a pan-European group backed by more than 30 countries, said Maltese police seldom used information gathered to trace criminal money and not enough was being done to tackle money laundering risks in online gambling.
A group of key Maltese government ministers issued a statement to say they were happy with the progress the country had made so far and they would prepare a one-year plan to implement Moneyval's 58 recommendations.
They said the country was ""deeply committed"" to tackling money laundering and terrorist financing.
Despite having a population of only 420,000, Malta, a former British naval stronghold south of Sicily, has a financial sector that dwarfs many EU countries. It is also the European leader in online gaming.
Moneyval said that although the country had tried to better understand money laundering risks, investigations were hampered by ""limited resources, both human and financial"".
Moneyval said they were ""not convinced"" Maltese police could effectively investigate and prosecute ""cases related to financial, bribery and corruption offences.""
Last year, Pilatus Bank, an international lender based on the island, was shut down by the European Central Bank after its chairman was accused in the United States of money laundering and bank fraud.
The lender had received a clean sheet from Maltese authorities despite allegations of processing corrupt payments by investigative journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia, who was killed by a car bomb (tinyurl.com/yd8nmmap).

210,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 13, 2019 04:17AM ET</span>","Japan Post Bank admits improper sales to elderly clients, discovers 19,500 cases","By Takashi Umekawa and Takaya Yamaguchi
TOKYO (Reuters) -  Japan Post Bank Co Ltd  (T:7182) said on Friday it had improperly sold investment trust products to elderly customers in about 19,500 cases, the latest instance of misconduct at the state-backed postal and financial group before a planned share sale.
The bank said it discovered branches and post offices had neglected an internal rule requiring staff to confirm twice that customers aged 70 years or older were in good health and had a good grasp of its products before making any sales.
An investigation by the unit of  Japan Post Holdings Co Ltd  (T:6178) discovered 17,700 cases where products were improperly sold at its 213 branches and 1,891 cases at post offices in the year ending March, the bank said at a news briefing.
""The problem comes from staff, without giving it much thought, believing it's not a big problem,"" an official at the bank told reporters.
The misconduct casts a shadow over the government's plan to sell $10 billion worth of its shares in Japan Post Holdings to pay for reconstruction in areas hit by the 2011 earthquake and tsunami. 
Shares in Japan Post Holdings have dived about 15% since revelations in July of impropriety at another subsidiary,  Japan Post Insurance Co Ltd  (T:7181). Analysts have said the government may delay its share sale due to the price slide.
Japanese banks have struggled with years of near-zero interest rates and a dwindling population that have made the traditional lending business less profitable.

Given the nation's relatively high savings rate and the number of wealthy individuals, Japan's personal financial assets totaled 1,830 trillion yen ($17 trillion) at the end of 2018, according to the Bank of Japan.

Mike Coupe said the Oct. 31 Brexit date could not come at a worst time for supermarkets because warehouses were already full with Christmas produce and more of the supply of fresh salad had switched to southern Europe.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Thursday that the government had been ""massively accelerating"" its preparations, and the country would ""be ready"" if Britain left the EU without a deal at the end of October.
Asked if plans were in place that meant disruption to food supplies could be ruled out, Coupe told BBC radio : ""I disagree with that wholeheartedly, the reality is there will inevitably be disruption, simply because we've never done this before.""
Other supermarket bosses said on Thursday that Britain was unlikely to run out of essentials like toilet paper in the event of a no-deal Brexit but some fresh fruit and vegetables could be in short supply and prices might rise.
Senior retail figures have also said that the government's demand for supermarkets to prepare for a no-deal Brexit by stockpiling food was stoking anger in the industry, with bosses saying they should not be blamed if people can't find everything they want on the shelves."
214,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 13, 2019 03:01AM ET</span>","Investing green is all the rage, but benchmarks still hazy","By Swati Pandey and Patturaja Murugaboopathy 
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Global money managers and companies are rushing to meet a deadline to report on their carbon footprint, but the lack of a standard metric raises concerns their efforts could just be a box-ticking exercise in the transition from brown to green.
From 2020, firms with some $118 trillion of funds under management - among 800 signatories to a United Nations pact - will make climate-risk related disclosures as an early step towards making the world a better place by 2030.
The problem with assessing carbon footprints is that there are no universal criteria for benchmarking environmental, social and governance (ESG) - the key factors in measuring the sustainability and ethical impact of an investment.
""The way you quantify climate impact and consider transition risks could differ from company to company,"" said Stephane Andre, a Sydney-based portfolio manager at Alphinity Investments which has A$8.2 billion ($5.65 billion) in assets under management.
""There is no prescriptive way to look at it,"" he added. ""What it means is in the short term there might be limited value in it."" 
That hasn't stopped stakeholders such as Andre from piling pressure on companies to tackle the 17 United Nations 'sustainable development goals' such as zero hunger, gender equality and clean energy. 
Mining titan BHP Billiton (AX:BHP) surprised markets this year when it announced plans to cut carbon emissions not just at its own facilities but for its customers as well. It exited some coal projects, on the heels of rival  Rio Tinto  (L:RIO). 
Large banks have begun disclosing their carbon exposures while setting targets for clean lending, while insurers including Chubb (BN:CB) (N:CB) and Suncorp (AX:SUN), have moved away from coverage for new coal projects. 
Top U.S. retailer Walmart (N:WMT) said this month it would stop selling ammunition for handguns in all its stores across the country and Australia's Woolworths (AX:WOW) became the first supermarket chain in the world to issue a certified climate bond this year. 
Despite a blitz of such corporate announcements, fund managers are constantly trying to differentiate between genuine ESG and spin by looking for deeper disclosures from the companies they screen, in areas such as gender pay gap and relationship with employees and suppliers.
But not all companies publish data on ESG impact yet, and analyzing data from those that do is also challenging. ""Data isn't always readily available, and not all investors have access to advanced analytical tools or various ESG data sets,"" said Jessica Huang, head of Americas and APAC platform for Blackrock (NYSE:BLK) Sustainable Investing. ""Investors often rely too much on historical data, which may not provide an accurate prediction of future trends.""
ESG SCORE 
Some investment managers use so-called ESG ratings provided by firms such as Fitch Ratings.
One MSCI study found that companies with higher average ESG ratings had lower risks, greater profitability and higher dividend yields. Yet, those ESG scores are based on the levels of disclosure by a company, not an actual assessment of practices. 
Worryingly, a comparison of FTSE and MSCI ESG scores has hardly any correlation, said Mike Lubrano, managing director for corporate governance & sustainability at Cartica Management. 
Variations in the components and weightings of the underlying metrics used by different index providers also generate widely divergent scores, he noted.
Despite the challenges of measuring ESG performance, investments in the stream are rising. Investors believe that if companies do well on ESG metrics, such focus will make their businesses more sustainable in the long term. 
Indeed, an analysis of the top 500 companies in Asia, based on ESG metrics, shows their average returns outperformed the broader MSCI Asia Pacific index (MIAPJ0000PUS) each time in the last 10 years. 
(GRAPHIC: Asian ESG leaders' price performance - https://tmsnrt.rs/2Adko9m)
Data from Lipper showed assets under management of ethical, water and alternative energy funds in Asia climbed 16% to $28.5 billion in the first half of 2019 from a year ago.
In debt markets, climate bond issuances surpassed $150 billion this year though still a far cry from the $1 trillion goal for 2020, according to Climate Bonds Initiative. 
The increased momentum has meant that banks are engaging more actively with their corporate clients while shareholders are rallying behind green groups demanding companies cut emissions, lift governance and improve social responsibilities.
So called responsible investors also shun industries that negatively affect society, including companies that produce or invest in alcohol, tobacco, gambling and guns.
Such activism prompted Australian supermarket giant Woolworths (AX:WOW) to finally agree, after years of engagement with investors, to offload its profitable pub and liquor business in July. 
""Poker machines are horrible things but they are very profitable,"" said Bruce Smith, another portfolio manager at Alphinity. ""Once they get rid of that business, Woolworths will become a possible investment for us."" 

Woolworths did not specifically comment on its decision, saying only that the move would help it simplify its structure and focus on the retail business.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Billionaire investor Carl Icahn, a born New Yorker who has run his business from the city for decades, is moving his office, more than half of his staff and himself to Florida early next year, people familiar with the plan said on Thursday.
The 83-year-old investor, known for picking winners and facing off with captains of industry, has grown weary of working in New York and has been mulling the move for several years, the people said.
A few months ago he informed staff at his publicly traded company  Icahn Enterprises  (O:IEP) that he plans to shutter his Manhattan office at the end of March 2020 and open a new office near Miami, where he has long had a home, in April 2020.
He will pay staff who move a $50,000 relocation benefit and severance to those who decide not to join him. Icahn employs roughly 50 people in New York and more than half, including some of his lawyers and portfolio analysts, will move, the people said.
News of the move was first reported by the New York Post.
Icahn did not return an email seeking comment.
Icahn is the latest in a string of financial executives, including billionaire hedge fund managers Paul Tudor Jones and David Tepper, who are decamping from the Northeast for Florida which boasts lower taxes.
But for Icahn, who has pledged to give away at least half of his wealth by signing Warren Buffett and Bill Gates' Giving Pledge, the reason to move is more about lifestyle than taxes, someone who knows him said. 
At an age when most people would have retired, Icahn is still working full days and pushing companies to perform better. He has long told associates that work exhilarates him and he has no plans to stop.
While he gave up investing for outside clients eight years ago, his vast personal wealth, estimated at $17.5 billion, allows him to stay in the game, putting billions to work in companies like Caesars Entertainment which merged with Eldorado Resorts (O:ERI) earlier this year. He is also complaining loudly about Occidental Petroleum's (N:OXY) decision to buy Anadarko, mulling ways to influence the company more directly.
But life in New York, where he dines at favorite haunts like Il Tinello and works late hours at his Midtown office, was beginning to wear on him. 

Squeezing in an after-work tennis game, something he likes to do at his Florida home, is nearly impossible in New York. He was already spending more time in Florida during the colder months and is considering selling his New York City home, a person familiar with his thinking said.

217,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 12, 2019 11:36PM ET</span>",Record low rates deliver competitive advantages to Australia's biggest banks: regulator,"By Paulina Duran
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's banking watchdog on Friday said record-low interest rates are likely to benefit the country's ""Big Four"" lenders over their smaller counterparts due to their better capital position and access to cheaper funds.
Speaking at an industry event in Melbourne, the Chairman of the Australian  Prudential  (LON:PRU) Regulation Authority (APRA), Wayne Byres, said all banks should adapt to lower interest rates that will hurt profitability and their ability to generate capital, and that smaller banks would be at a competitive disadvantage.
""Given their different funding profiles, these trends may well impact smaller banks more forcefully than larger ones, reducing the ability of the former to apply competitive pressure to the latter,"" Byres said.
Australia's central bank in June and July cut interest rates to a record low of 1% and financial futures show investors are pricing in two further cuts by mid-2020, which would put further pressure on banks' interest margins - the difference between interest paid and earned.
Australian bank earnings have already suffered by the central bank's move to cut the cash rate, as it gets harder to reduce already low deposit rates to offset the cheaper mortgages banks must offer borrowers.
Smaller banks, however, would fare worse as they do not have the high capital levels of the four biggest - Commonwealth Bank of Australia (AX:CBA), Westpac Banking Corp (AX:WBC), National Australia Bank Ltd (AX:NAB) and Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd (ANZ) (AX:ANZ) - and therefore must pay higher rates for funds.
Byres said the regulator was considering the long-term challenges this dynamic would pose on the banking system and to competition, which has been lacking in a sector where those four banks dominate 80% of the market.
APRA needed ""to think harder about the impact on business models and business lines of a very low interest rate environment persisting for a lengthy period of time,"" Byres said.
NO FALLOUT WITH NEW ZEALAND COUNTERPART
The regulator also denied suggestions of a ""falling out"" with the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) after banking analysts at  Citigroup  Inc (N:C) said their divergent policies were leading into unnecessarily higher capital levels for the big four banks that fund both economies.
The RBNZ last year proposed the Big Four Australian lenders that provide almost 90% of banking products in its country to raise NZ$20 billion ($12.81 billion) over the next five years.
The Australian regulator then responded with its own directive for the banks to limit their capital exposure offshore to a maximum of 25%, down from half, prompting ANZ, who has the largest New Zealand operation, to say it would need to start ring-fencing profit in that country.
""There has been some suggestion that this reflects some kind of falling out between us, or evidence of trans-Tasman one-upmanship,"" Byres said.
""In fact, the opposite is the case ... and we communicate frequently at all levels.""
""The processes underway are a natural by-product of both regulators working to protect their respective communities from the costs of financial instability,"" Byres said. ""We are entirely comfortable with that."""

Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index gained 0.3% by 10:30 PM ET (02:30 GMT). 
Citing five unnamed person familiar with the matter, Bloomberg reported that the Trump administration officials are considering to offer a limited trade agreement to China that would delay and even roll back some U.S. tariffs.
The discussions are preliminary and Trump has yet to sign off on it, Bloomberg noted. 
“A lot of people are talking about, and I see a lot of analysts are saying: an interim deal, meaning we’ll do pieces of it, the easy ones first,” Trump told reporters late Thursday. “But there’s no easy or hard. There’s a deal or there’s not a deal. But it’s something we would consider.”
The president added that he would preferred to “get the whole deal done,” but did not rule the possibility of an interim pact. 
In-person negotiations between the two sides are set to take place in October in Washington. 
Elsewhere, the European Central Bank (ECB) announced overnight a quantitative easing program that entails 20 billion euros per month. The central bank also cut its main deposit rate by 10 basis points to -0.5%, in line with market expectations. 
The ECB will likely keep rates at present or lower levels until the inflation outlook “robustly converge to a level sufficiently close to but below 2% within its projection horizon, and such convergence has been persistent.”
“In view of the weakening economic outlook and the continued prominence of downside risk, governments with fiscal space should act in an effective and timely manner,” ECB President Mario Draghi said.
“In countries where public debt is high, governments need to pursue prudent policies that will create the conditions for automatic stabilizers to operate freely. All countries should reinforce their efforts to achieve a more growth-friendly composition of public finances,” he added.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration is moving forward with a plan to revoke California's authority to set its own vehicle greenhouse gas standards and declare that states are pre-empted from setting their own vehicle rules, three people briefed on the matter said on Thursday.
President Donald Trump met with senior officials on Thursday at the White House to discuss the administration's plan to divide its August 2018 proposal to rollback Obama era standards through 2025 and revoke California's waiver under the Clean Air Act to set state requirements for vehicles, the people said.
The meeting included Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Andrew Wheeler, Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao, National Economic Council director Larry Kudlow, Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen and acting Office and Management and Budget director Russell Vought, the sources said.
The White House and the agencies declined to comment.
On Tuesday, Wheeler told reporters the administration had not made a final decision to divide the rule into two parts.
Following the meeting, sources said the administration plans to move ahead in coming weeks to divide the final regulation and finalize first the portion dealing with preempting states before issuing the new yearly standards.
The EPA in August 2018 proposed revoking a waiver granted to California in 2013 under the Clean Air Act as part of the Trump administration's plan to roll back Obama-era fuel economy standards.
Under Trump, federal regulators backed freezing emissions requirements for new cars and trucks at 2020 levels through 2026. Administration officials say its final regulation will include a modest boost in annual efficiency requirements but far less than what the Obama administration set in 2012.
The Obama-era rules called for a fleetwide fuel efficiency average of 46.7 mpg by 2025, with average annual increases of about 5%, compared with 37 mpg by 2026 under the Trump administration's preferred option to freeze requirements.
Last week, Reuters and other news outlets reported the U.S. Justice Department is investigating whether the decision of four automakers in July to reach a voluntary agreement with California to adopt state emissions standards violated antitrust law.
 Ford Motor Co  (N:F), BMW AG (DE:BMWG), Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p) and Honda Motor Co (T:7267) struck a deal to adopt standards that were lower than Obama era rules but higher than the Trump administration's 2018 proposal.
California and other states had vowed to enforce stricter Obama-era emissions standards, after Trump proposed rolling back the federal rules. Automakers worry that court battles between state and federal governments could create years of uncertainty."

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Reuters asked a U.S. judge on Thursday to unseal documents filed in court regarding potential risks associated with Propecia, Merck & Co's popular baldness drug. 
The motion was filed in federal court in Brooklyn, New York, after a Reuters article on Wednesday revealed accusations that Merck did not fully disclose on Propecia’s label the incidence and duration of sexual dysfunction in men who took Propecia in clinical trials. Those allegations are contained in court filings that had been intended to be filed under seal. Read the Reuters report https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-courts-secrecy-propecia
Federal District Judge Brian Cogan has allowed Merck to keep secret internal company documents in litigation brought by Propecia users against the company. A faulty redaction allowed Reuters to view some of the details in a plaintiff's brief, but the underlying Merck documents cited in that brief are still sealed. Those are the documents the Reuters motion seeks to make public. 
""This is a case of tremendous importance that has been sealed without on-the-record findings explaining that sealing,"" Reuters argued in its motion to intervene in the case. ""The First Amendment precludes such an outcome."" 
Merck did not respond to a request for comment. The company previously told Reuters it ""stands behind the safety and efficacy of Propecia"" and noted that the drug has been prescribed safely to millions of men since the late 1990s. 
A June 25 Reuters investigation revealed how judges have allowed the makers of dozens of consumer products to file under seal in their courts information that is pertinent to public health and safety. They often do so without explanation, though in most jurisdictions, they are required to provide one. Read the Reuters investigation https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-courts-secrecy-judges/
The investigation found that hundreds of thousands of Americans have been killed or seriously injured over the past couple of decades by allegedly defective products -- drugs, cars, medical devices and other products -- while evidence that could have alerted consumers and regulators to potential danger remained under seal. 
More than 1,100 Propecia-related lawsuits filed across the U.S. against Merck were consolidated before Judge Cogan in so-called multidistrict litigation (MDL). Merck agreed to settle most of them last year for $4.3 million, to be divided among the plaintiffs. Prior to the settlement, plaintiffs' lawyers cited internal company communications to allege that in revisions to the drug's original label, Merck understated the number of men who experienced sexual symptoms in clinical trials, and how long those symptoms lasted. Merck settled before responding to the allegation in court. 
Under U.S. law, court filings are presumed to be public, and the bar for secrecy is particularly high for the Propecia documents Reuters seeks to unseal, the motion states, because they are essential to plaintiffs' claim that the drug causes persistent sexual side effects. 

""These documents should not remain under seal absent the most compelling reasons,"" Reuters argued. Read the Reuters motion https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/assets/usa-courts-secrecy-propecia/reuters_motion_to_unseal.pdf

The proposed class action filed on Wednesday night by Uber driver Angela McRay appears to be the first since California's senate passed landmark legislation that could affect workers in many industries, in addition to ride-sharing companies such as Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc.
Governor Gavin Newsom supports the proposed law, which is known as Assembly Bill 5 and would take effect on Jan. 1, though it may undergo changes before it reaches his desk.
McRay, a Pittsburg, California, resident who said she has driven for Uber since November 2016, faulted the company for having ""publicly stated that it intends to defy this statute,"" by continuing to treat drivers as independent contractors.
""This ongoing defiance of the law constitutes a willful violation of California law,"" the complaint said. McRay is seeking damages for Uber drivers in California, and an injunction requiring compliance.
Uber Chief Legal Officer Tony West said on Wednesday that the law did not automatically reclassify drivers as employees, but made it harder to call them independent workers. ""We can pass the harder test to the satisfaction of arbitrators and courts,"" he said.
An Uber spokesman on Thursday said: ""Under AB5, the classification test would now be different in California, but that doesn't mean we won't pass the test.""
The law has attracted national attention because of the size of California's workforce, which includes several hundred thousand contract workers.
Labor groups and other supporters of the law have said it would help long-suffering contractors by entitling them to coverage under minimum wage and overtime laws, and afford greater access to health insurance and expense reimbursements.
The law has been criticized by trade groups and ""gig economy"" companies dependent on contract workers because of the extra financial burdens.
Assembly Bill 5 would codify a 2018 California Supreme Court decision that narrowed when employers could classify workers as independent contractors.
Uber, rival  Lyft  Inc (NASDAQ:LYFT) and food delivery service DoorDash have pushed for separate legislation to boost driver pay and benefits while preserving their independent contractor status.
In March, Uber agreed to pay $20 million to settle a nearly six-year-old lawsuit by California and Massachusetts drivers over their classifications.

The case is McRay v  Uber Technologies Inc , U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 19-05723.

223,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 12, 2019 07:29PM ET</span>","Philippine fast food specialist Jollibee hungry to expand in U.S., China","By Neil Jerome Morales and Martin Petty
MANILA (Reuters) -  Jollibee Foods  Corp (PS:JFC), the Philippine fast food specialist known for fried 'Chickenjoy' and chopped hotdogs in sweet spaghetti sauce, is doubling down on expansion plans in the United States and China that are likely to include more M&A.
Helped by the purchase of California-based Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf in July and having taken full control of Denver-based Smashburger in 2018, it wants to earn 30% of its revenue in the United States in a decade's time, executives told Reuters.
It is also aiming to lift revenue in China to 30% of overall sales, while the Philippines would fall to 30%.
That would represent a major rejig of revenue streams for Jollibee, which ranks No. 4 among Asia's listed quick service restaurant firms, and would build upon plans to cut its reliance on its domestic market to 50% of sales in the ""medium term"".
Prior to its acquisition of Coffee Bean, the Philippines accounted for 73% of sales while the United States represented 15% and China 12%.
""We want to spread our portfolio and risk,"" Jollibee CEO Ernesto Tanmantiong said in an interview. ""There's huge opportunity out there."" 
Jollibee, which is valued at $4.8 billion and has 16 brands or franchises to its name, aims to have six brands each in the United States and China, just as it does in the Philippines.
In the U.S. market, it currently has five including its namesake Jollibee restaurant chain and a minority investment in Tortas Frontera, run by Michelin-starred chef Rick Bayless and which offers Mexican-inspired sandwiches at just three outlets in Chicago's O'Hare airport.
It has three brands in China - the Dunkin Donuts franchise, as well as the Yonghe King noodle and Hong Zhuang Yuan congee restaurant chains.

TRUSTING ONE'S GUT
Jollibee likes to acquire quite small, loss-making firms at low prices and turn them around. It receives business proposals frequently but acquisitions are more often stumbled upon during one of Chairman's Tony Tan Caktiong long food tasting trips than sought out through bankers.
""Most of the acquisitions resulted from Tan Caktiong eating in a restaurant, liking the food and asking 'who runs the place?',"" said Erwin Elechicon, former chief of Jollibee's international operations.
That was the case with Tortas Frontera. Tan, also founder of the company and brother of CEO Tanmantiong, had eaten one of its sandwiches at the airport.
While noting they tend to buy small, Jollibee executives say they are open to any type of acquisition if the food is good. 
But they acknowledge their immediate focus is on turning around Smashburger and Coffee Bean - both loss-making and bigger than Jollibee's usual acquisitions with $210 million spent on Smashburger and Coffee Bean costing $350 million including debt.
Investor concerns that Jollibee is overextended were exacerbated by first-half profit sliding by a third to 2.66 billion pesos ($51 million) due to losses at Smashburger and deliveries problems with its Red Ribbon Bakeshop. Its stock has lost 18% since late July when it announced its purchase of Coffee Bean.
""It would be better for them not to do another acquisition at least of this scale until Smashburger and CBTL become profitable,"" said Renzo Louie Candano, analyst at DBP-Daiwa Capital Markets in Manila.
Jollibee believes, however, that it has not overreached. Nor is it concerned that any of its targeted markets are saturated or that it might not be able to compete with the likes of Starbucks (O:SBUX).
""Every restaurant in the Philippines has fried chicken, in Vietnam there are maybe 10 coffee shops on every block. In the midst of all of this competition, there's always a standout one or two,"" said Chief Financial Officer Ysmael Baysa.
""How are you going to do it? Our formula is very simple. Offer the best tasting food at the right price and you're going to make it.""
He noted that Coffee Bean had a strong presence in Southeast Asia and the Middle East, regions where coffee culture still has a lot of room to grow and that its Highlands Coffee stores in Vietnam logged revenue growth of around 32% last year.
It has also taken on big chains before.
Not long after Jollibee, originally an ice cream parlor, started selling burgers in 1978, friends advised Tan Caktiong and his brothers to quit, warning the imminent arrival of U.S. giant McDonald's (N:MCD) in Philippines would decimate Jollibee's six branches.
Undeterred, the firm took on McDonald's by surrounding each big branch with smaller Jollibee outlets, and measuring the U.S firm's sales by counting trash outside its branches. Since 1984, Jollibee has outsold McDonald's domestically.
(GRAPHIC: Jollibee and McDonald's in the Philippines - https://graphics.reuters.com/JOLLIBEE-EXPANSION/0100B26112S/PHILIPPINES-JOLLIBEE2.jpg)
Outside the Philippines, Jollibee restaurant locations tend to be in areas with large expat Filipino populations. But executives point to its growing popularity with non-Filipinos, particularly in Vietnam, Singapore and Hong Kong.

It also has big plans to expand the Jollibee chain in North America, aiming for 150 U.S. stores and 100 in Canada over five years, up from 37 and 4 respectively.

224,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 12, 2019 06:46PM ET</span>",LSE board poised to decide fate of Hong Kong exchange's $39 billion offer,"By Sumeet Chatterjee, Sinead Cruise and David French
HONG KONG/LONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - The London Stock Exchange's (L:LSE) board will meet in coming days to decide on the Hong Kong bourse's surprise $39 billion takeover proposal, a source close to the British company said on Thursday, as the market poured cold water on the deal.
The unsolicited takeover offer is not expected to succeed given a preference among LSE investors for the exchange to complete its $27 billion proposed acquisition of data and analytics group Refinitiv, the source close to the LSE said.
The exchange wants to focus on executing that deal, rather than risk it being derailed by the Hong Kong bourse, the source said. Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing's (HKEX) (HK:0388) offer requires the LSE to ditch the Refinitiv purchase.
But a person close to the Hong Kong exchange said a rejection of an initial approach was common in takeovers and HKEX was already considering its next step. Informal discussions between HKEX and LSE shareholders have begun, the person added.
The Financial Times reported on Thursday that HKEX was open to considering a higher element of cash in its offer, citing a person familiar with the matter.
An LSE spokeswoman declined to comment.
The proposed deal, announced on Wednesday, aims to create an exchange powerhouse spanning Asia, Europe and the United States which would be better able to compete with U.S. rivals such as Intercontinental Exchange Inc (N:ICE) and CME Group Inc (O:CME). 
However shares in HKEX fell more than 3% on Thursday as investors raised concerns about the political and regulatory risks involved in its move to take over one of Britain's marquee financial institutions.
The UK government said authorities would examine the proposed deal closely as the LSE was a ""critically important part"" of the British financial system. 
However a takeover could face regulatory scrutiny beyond British shores; the London bourse also owns the Milan exchange and has a significant American presence through its FTSE Russell index subsidiary and LCH, its derivatives clearing house which dominates the U.S. dollar swap market. 
This means a deal could also draw the attention of watchdogs in Italy and the United States, which is locked in a trade war with China. 
HKEX declined to comment.
The Hong Kong exchange's indicative offer for the LSE also received a cool reception in London, where LSE shares finished up 5.9% on Wednesday, far short of the proposed takeover's implied premium. 
Another major sticking point is the requirement for the LSE to abandon its acquisition of financial information provider Refinitiv from U.S. private equity firm Blackstone Group Inc (N:BX) and  Thomson Reuters Corp  (TO:TRI), the parent of Reuters News.
That deal, which went public in late July, caused LSE's shares to leap 15% on hopes Refinitiv's business would boost its long-term profitability. LSE said in a statement on Wednesday that it remained committed to the Refinitiv deal. 
HKEX has 28 days to make a firm bid for the LSE, whose shares closed up nearly 1% at 7,274 pence on Thursday or walk away for six months.
The source close to the LSE said that while the Hong Kong deal offered a gateway into China's economy, the LSE had already established its own entry point with a recently launched stock market link with Shanghai.
PROTESTS AND POLITICAL RISK
Analysts said a perception that Beijing is exerting growing influence over Hong Kong could become another key sticking point for an LSE takeover, given the Hong Kong government's close links with the HKEX.
Fitch Ratings said that ""increasing control by Chinese authorities over Hong Kong"" could raise regulatory concerns in Britain and the United States about data and information security.
Hong Kong is entering a fourth month of sometimes violent protests sparked by legislation that would have drawn the former British colony closer to the Chinese legal system.
The government's handling of the protests has been criticized internationally, as has the political pressure applied by Beijing to Hong Kong companies not to support the pro-democracy movement.
""The transaction will require various regulatory approvals, which will stress-test the world's understanding of Hong Kong's 'one country, two systems' constitution,"" said David Blennerhassett, an independent analyst writing on the SmartKarma research platform.
The Hong Kong government is the biggest shareholder in HKEX, with a 6% stake. It approves six of the 13 board members and can also stop any other shareholding rising above 5%. 
Four U.S.-based lawyers said it was possible the deal would qualify for a review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), which assesses transactions for national security concerns, including critical infrastructure. 
While this has traditionally been thought of as utilities, telecommunications and transportation, key financial market infrastructure could meet this classification, one lawyer said. 
""Hong Kong is changing and its government is increasingly under the thumb of Beijing,"" said one of the lawyers, Dave Hanke, a partner at Arent Fox.
""So, if CFIUS does review the deal, it would likely treat the Hong Kong exchange the same as it would a mainland Chinese entity,"" added Hanke, who helped craft the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act, legislation due to be implemented next year which aims to beef up CFIUS' oversight powers.
The U.S. Treasury said it could not comment on whether CFIUS would review the proposed deal.
Even if the deal does not qualify for CFIUS review, it could fall foul of broader political concerns in Washington over the role of Chinese companies in the U.S. economy.
In February 2018, the Securities and Exchange Commission blocked the sale of the Chicago Stock Exchange to a group led by China-based investors, citing a lack of information on the would-be buyers and how the deal would impact its ability to monitor the exchange. 
That deal was approved by CFIUS but had been strongly criticized by U.S. President Donald Trump ahead of its nixing.
The United States has also leant on foreign allies in the past to spike deals it felt could indirectly affect its security, including German chip equipment maker  Aixtron  (DE:AIXGn) in 2016. American authorities have in recent months openly campaigned against Chinese telecoms giant Huawei Technologies Co Ltd [HWT.UL] from installing 5G infrastructure in countries around the world.
In Italy, the ruling 5-Star Movement said it would closely monitor HKEX's move to ensure any development did not harm national interests. The LSE owns Italy's stock exchange.
Analysts said HKEX's share price fall reflected scepticism the approach would succeed and investor concern about the dilutive impact of the cash-and-shares offer. 
Under the terms of the offer, LSE shareholders would receive 2,045 pence in cash and 2.495 newly issued HKEX shares. HKEX said it intended to apply for a secondary listing of its shares on the LSE if the deal went through.

""If the market thought the deal was going to go ahead, I would have expected the shares to have fallen by more than 3%, typically that's what we'd expect for an acquirer in a deal like this,"" said Michael Wu, analyst at Morningstar.

225,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 12, 2019 06:46PM ET</span>",U.S. House panel wants Boeing CEO to allow employee interviews on 737 MAX crashes,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Congress on Thursday asked Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co's chief executive to make several employees available for interviews as part of a congressional probe into the design, development and certification of 737 MAX aircraft involved in two crashes that killed 346 people.
House of Representatives Transportation Committee Chairman Peter DeFazio and Representative Rick Larsen, who chairs the aviation subcommittee, said in a statement that while Boeing has provided substantial documents and shared senior management’s perspective, ""it’s important to the committee’s investigation to hear from relevant Boeing employees."" 
The committee plans another Boeing hearing in the coming weeks and previously asked whistleblowers to come forward with any information about the plane's development. Boeing has provided more than 300,000 pages of documents, a person briefed on the matter said, speaking on condition of anonymity. 
Boeing said in a statement it was ""deeply disappointed the committee chose to release private correspondence given our extensive cooperation to date. We will continue to be transparent and responsive to the committee.""
The 737 MAX, Boeing’s best-selling jet, was grounded globally in March, days after the crash of an Ethiopian Airlines flight that followed a similar Lion Air disaster in Indonesia in October. A total of 346 people died in the two crashes.
Federal prosecutors aided by the FBI, the Department of Transportation’s inspector general and several blue-ribbon panels are investigating the 737 MAX as well as how the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certifies new aircraft.
Major U.S. airlines have canceled flights into December as a result of the MAX grounding, including American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) Group Inc and United Airlines, while Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) Co has canceled flights into early January. 
CEO Dennis Muilenburg said at an investor conference on Wednesday that the company is still targeting ""early fourth quarter for getting the airplane back up in the air"" but added that ""ultimately return-to-service timing will be determined by the regulator.""
The FAA has repeatedly said it will not certify the plane to fly again until it is safe to do so.
The European Aviation and Space Agency said on Tuesday it ""intends to conduct its own test flights separate from, but in full coordination with, the FAA. The test flights are not scheduled yet, the date will depend on the development schedule of Boeing.""
Muilenburg said it is possible not all regulators around the world will concurrently approve the MAX to fly again. Boeing has said it plans to conduct a certification test flight in the “September time frame"" but Muilenburg did not give a specific date when asked on Wednesday.
Some officials do not expect the 737 MAX to actually resume flights until early 2020.
The Wall Street Journal reported on Sept. 1 that a Boeing briefing in August was cut short by U.S., European and other regulators who complained the company failed to answer specific questions about modifications in the operation of MAX flight-control computers.

A U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed frustration with the lack of some answers from Boeing.

226,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 12, 2019 06:41PM ET</span>","Broadcom says chip demand has hit bottom, but uncertain on recovery timing","By Arjun Panchadar
(Reuters) - Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) Inc said on Thursday demand for microchips had hit a bottom and would remain at current levels, a sign that an industry downturn may linger, and added that there was no clear indication as to when the recovery would take place.
The chip industry has been in a slowdown with research firm Gartner forecasting a 9.6% drop in global semiconductor revenue to $429 billion in 2019. U.S.-China trade tensions, including tariffs on some products and the restrictions on sales to Huawei, have been pressuring chipmakers.
""...There is not much clarity or visibility yet, or certainty that any sharp recovery is around the corner,"" Chief Executive Officer Hock Tan said on a post-earnings call.
He said the company is managing its chip business with an expectation that it will continue to operate in a ""very low growth, uncertain macro environment"" for the foreseeable future.
Shares of Broadcom fell 1.5% in extended trading. 
Revenue from the company's semiconductor solutions segment fell about 5% to $4.35 billion from a year ago.
Total net revenue rose to $5.52 billion in the third quarter ended Aug. 4 from $5.06 billion, but missed analysts average estimate of $5.54 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
The chipmaker also maintained its full-year 2019 revenue forecast of $22.50 billion, saying that although the U.S.-China trade conflict continues, it had not seen further deterioration in its business, both globally and in China.
""Our industry checks point to a modest demand recovery in the second half of 2019 but we think it is appropriate for Broadcom to provide a cautious outlook at this juncture due to the uncertainty caused by the trade friction,"" Summit Insights Group analyst Kinngai Chan said.
Through a string of big-money acquisitions, the latest being a $10.7 billion proposed deal to buy Symantec (NASDAQ:SYMC) Corp's enterprise security unit, Tan has propelled the chipmaker that was worth just a few billions to a market capitalization of about $118 billion in the period that he has been at the helm.
After its move to buy peer Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc in what would have been the biggest-ever technology deal was blocked, Broadcom acquired software maker CA Technologies for $19 billion to diversify its revenue stream.
Net income attributable to common stock fell to $715 million, or $1.71 per share, in the quarter, from $1.2 billion, or $2.71 per share, a year earlier.

Excluding items, Broadcom earned a profit of $5.16 per share, beating estimates of a profit of $5.13 per share.

CHICAGO (Reuters) - U.S. health officials on Thursday cut the number of lung illnesses linked to e-cigarettes and vaping products under investigation to 380 as states began assessing patients based on a narrower case definition issued late last month by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
The revised total now only includes confirmed and probable cases. The CDC had previously reported it was investigating more than 450 ""possible"" cases in the multistate-outbreak of the mysterious lung illness.
Six people have died from vaping-related illness, a number that remains unchanged, the CDC said. The deaths were reported in California, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Minnesota, and Oregon.
As of Sept. 11, an additional three states have reported cases of the severe lung illness linked to vaping, raising the total to 36 states plus the U.S. Virgin Islands, the agency said.
The CDC defines confirmed cases as patients who developed a breathing illness after vaping and underwent extensive testing that ruled out an infection. A probable case is someone who developed a lung illness after vaping and underwent some testing.
While the rash of illnesses has not yet been linked to a specific product or ingredient, health officials have urged consumers to avoid vaping altogether.
For those who continue, officials said they should avoid buying vaping products on the street, using marijuana-derived oil with the products or modifying a store-bought vape product, and to avoid inhaling vitamin E acetate, an ingredient found in some vaping products."
228,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 12, 2019 06:25PM ET</span>","Consumer groups, unions urge caution on $63 billion AbbVie deal for Allergan","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - About a dozen advocacy groups and unions, including Public Citizen and the American Federation of Teachers, wrote the Federal Trade Commission on Thursday urging it to consider blocking drugmaker AbbVie Inc's (N:ABBV) planned $63 billion purchase of Botox maker Allergan Plc (N:AGN).
The combination of two of the world's biggest pharmaceutical companies, which was announced in June, would feature a portfolio that includes the world's top-selling medicine - AbbVie's rheumatoid arthritis drug Humira - as well as its cancer drugs and Allergan's blockbuster wrinkle treatment, Botox, and big-selling dry eye drug Restasis.
In the letter seen by Reuters, Consumer Action and others, working with the Service Employees International Union (SEIU) and American Federation of State, County, & Municipal Employees (AFSCME), noted the deal would create the fourth largest pharmaceutical company with strong markets for many drugs at a time when rising prices of many medicines have become a hot political issue.
For example, a four-week supply of Humira has a list price of about $5,174, amounting to more than $60,000 for a year. Humira sales reached $20 billion in 2018.
""We request that the Commission investigate this proposed merger thoroughly and take all necessary action, includ(ing) blocking the merger, to prevent further harm to consumers,"" the groups said in the letter.
The FTC declined comment. Neither of the companies immediately responded to a request for comment.
AbbVie has previously said that it would work with the FTC to discuss asset sales, which are sometimes needed to make deals conform with antitrust law.
The organizations urged the FTC to go further than simply identifying where there are product overlaps between the two companies, which is a big part of a traditional antitrust review of a merger of drug companies.
They argued in particular the merger could lead to a broader use of volume-based rebates or other incentives to insurers or pharmacy benefit managers. Drugmakers have said that their need to provide discounts and rebates to payers is one reason they have to keep prices high.
The group also criticized Allergan for practices like attempting to transfer patents for Restasis to a Native American tribe to protect it from patent challenges and delay market entry of cheaper generic versions.

""These practices should receive careful attention as part of the Commission’s investigation into the effects of this proposed merger and if an adequate remedy can not be found, the Commission should challenge this acquisition,"" the group said in their letter.

229,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 12, 2019 05:51PM ET</span>",Senior UAW official charged in widening U.S. corruption probe,"By Nick Carey and David Shepardson
DETROIT/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A senior United Auto Workers (UAW) official was arrested on Thursday and charged with conspiring with other union leaders to embezzle hundreds of thousands of dollars in a mushrooming corruption scandal that comes at a decisive moment in contract talks with Detroit automakers.
The union's current four-year contract with U.S. automakers expires on Saturday.
The contract talks were always expected to be contentious, with healthcare costs and profit sharing due to be major sticking points, but Saturday's deadline could be overshadowed by revelations of vast sums being spent on lavish entertainment by labor leaders - including $440 bottles of champagne originally created to please a Russian czar.
The union has worked to put the federal probe behind it and in 2018 elected Gary Jones, a former regional director for the union, as its president. He was chosen as he seemed far removed from the scandal.
But Vance Pearson, 58 served as Jones' second in command from 2016 to 2018 and replaced him last year as director of the UAW's so-called ""Region 5,"" which covers 17 western and southwestern U.S. states.
Pearson's arrest comes just two weeks after the FBI conducted searches including at Jones' home, as part of an ongoing corruption probe into illegal payments to union officials.
Jones has not been charged with any wrongdoing.
J. Bruce Maffeo, a lawyer for Jones, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Adding to intrigue, the complaint makes frequent reference to someone identified only as ""UAW Official A,"" saying government agents had seized $30,000 in cash from the individual's residence.
Steven Bernstein, a Tampa-based labor attorney at Fisher Phillips LLP, said the latest charges create a ""difficult dynamic"" for the union in talks with automakers.
""This does have the potential to compromise whatever leverage the union's leaders think they have,"" he said.
In a statement, the UAW said that while it found the allegations ""very concerning, we strongly believe that the government has misconstrued any number of facts and emphasize that these are merely allegations, not proof of wrongdoing.""
The complaint said between 2014 and 2018 Pearson and other leading UAW officials ""submitted fraudulent expense forms seeking reimbursement from the UAW's Detroit headquarters for expenditures supposedly incurred in connection with Region 5 leadership and training conferences.""
The officials ""used the conferences to conceal the use of hundreds of thousands of dollars in UAW funds to pay for lavish entertainment and personal spending for the conspirators,"" the complaint said.
Much of the complaint centers on conferences held by the UAW's Region 5 in Palm Springs, California. The allegations include that, through a ""master account"" set up at a Palm Springs hotel, union officials embezzled more than $600,000 that was spent on lavish living for weeks or months at a time.
The complaint singles out a dinner at a local restaurant on New Year's Eve 2016 that cost $6,600, including four bottles of Louis Roederer Cristal champagne for a total of $1,760.
The complaint then accurately quotes the Louis Roederer website as saying the Cristal was ""created in 1876 to satisfy the demanding tastes of (Russian) Tsar Alexander II,"" who was assassinated by a revolutionary in 1881.
Harley Shaiken, a labor expert at the University of California-Berkeley, said the charges against Pearson could be distraction for negotiators, but he said the union and its members are focused in getting the best deal possible.
""UAW members are focused on how a deal will affect them,"" he said. ""But even a small number of angry members could color a ratification vote on a contract.""
The ongoing scandal also affects a labor organization closely allied with Democrats a little over a year away from a U.S. presidential election. The UAW represents tens of thousands of workers in the battleground states of Ohio and Michigan.
To date, nine people have pleaded guilty in connection with the ongoing criminal investigation into illegal payoffs to UAW officials by  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles NV (MI:FCHA) executives and corruption within the UAW itself.
Last week, former UAW official Michael Grimes pleaded guilty to wire fraud and money laundering. Grimes was an official in the union's General Motors Co (N:GM) department until his retirement in July 2018."
230,By Investing.com,"<span>Sep 12, 2019 05:39PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch,"Investing.com - Here are the top three things to know that could rock markets. 
1. Retail Sales Eyed 
Retail sales figures will give investors clues into the health of the consumer, whose willingness to spend has kept the U.S. economy above water despite headwinds from the economic slowdown.
The Commerce Department will release the numbers at 8:30 AM ET (12:30 GMT).
On average, economists expect that retail sales rose 0.3% last month, compared with a 0.1% rise in July. The retail sales control group, which has a larger impact on U.S. GDP, is expected to have risen 0.3% from last month's 1% print.
2. Consumer Sentiment, Business Inventories Due
Consumer sentiment data will also provide investors with further insight into how Americans are feeling about the economy. 
The preliminary measure of the University of Michigan’s September consumer sentiment index, due at 10:00 AM ET, is forecast to show a reading of 90.9, up slightly from last month’s final reading of 89.8. (There are two readings of consumer sentiment each month.) 
At time same time, the Commerce Department is expected to report that business inventories increased 0.3% in August, up from no change in July. 
3. Rig Counts on Tap
The weekly instalment of drilling activity from Baker Hughes on Friday will provide investors with clues on U.S. oil production, which remains just off record highs of 12.5 million barrels. 
Data last week showed the number of oil rigs operating in the U.S. fell by 4 to 738.
The weekly rig count is an important barometer for the drilling industry and serves as a proxy for oil production and oil services demand.
Crude futures on Thursday settled 1.2% lower at $55.09 a barrel. "
231,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 12, 2019 05:37PM ET</span>",The Market’s Support System Is Breaking Down,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- European Central Bank President Mario Draghi brought out the bazooka on Thursday, cutting interest rates further below zero and announcing a plan to resume quantitative easing by purchasing 20 billion euros ($22 billion) of bonds a month for as long as it takes to reflate the economy. The response from markets was less than appreciative in yet another sign that investors believe central banks are quickly running out of ideas to stimulate flagging growth.
Markets, though, largely did the opposite of what would be expected when a central bank eases monetary policy. Government bonds tumbled, the euro rose the most in more than five weeks against its major peers and gains in the region’s equities trailed the global market for stocks. Sure, there was probably a bit of “buy on the rumor, sell on the fact” aspect to the moves because the ECB had flagged that much of this was coming. What wasn’t expected was the open-ended nature of QE, which should have been bullish for equities and bonds but bad for the euro. And, in fact, that’s what happened — until Draghi made an admission that no investor wants to hear after explaining how the central bank’s policies have prevented the economy from deteriorating even further. “Now it’s high time for the fiscal policy to take charge,” Draghi told reporters. Bonds immediately reversed their gains, the euro shot higher and the Euro Stoxx 600 Index fell from its highs of the day as investors interpreted the remarks as Draghi admitting that central banks have reached the limits of their abilities to sustain economic growth and underpin markets.
Investors aren’t being overly melodramatic. They are clearly concerned not only about the perpetual inability of the global economy to reach escape velocity but also about the increasing possibility of a global recession, even though major central banks have pumped trillions of dollars into the global financial system. The collective balance-sheet assets of the Federal Reserve, ECB, Bank of Japan and Bank of England have risen to 35.3% of their countries’ total GDP, up from about 10% in 2008, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
EQUITIES WANT TO BELIEVE
The S&P 500 Index rallied on Thursday, bringing it to less than 0.5% from its record closing high in July. But it wasn’t the prospect of more central bank stimulus that excited U.S. traders. Rather, it was a report by Bloomberg News that Trump administration officials have discussed offering a limited trade agreement to China that would delay and even roll back some U.S. tariffs for the first time in exchange for Chinese commitments on intellectual property and agricultural purchases. It didn’t matter that CNBC, citing senior administration officials it didn’t identity, disputed that the White House is considering an interim deal with China. Traders clearly believe that a trade war detente may come sooner rather than later amid signs that the economy is slowing rapidly. The speculation is that President Donald Trump doesn’t want to imperil his chances of being re-elected in 2020 by dragging out the conflict, so any truce — even if it’s far less than a grand bargain — would be desirable. A research note from the Fed last week concluded that the rise in trade conflicts in the first half of 2018 “accounts for a decline in the level of global GDP of about 0.8% by the first half of 2019.” And at an event in London on Thursday, Jeffrey Gundlach, the billionaire money manager and chief executive officer of DoubleLine Capital, put the odds of a U.S. recession before the election at 75%.
 INFLATION COMEBACK?
The weakness in European government bonds carried over to the U.S, where yields on benchmark 10-year Treasuries rose for an eighth consecutive day. At 1.79%, yields are the highest since the start of August and up from this year’s intraday low of 1.43% on Sept. 3. Optimism over U.S.-China trade talks certainly added to the weakness, but so did a surprising government report on inflation that was overshadowed by the ECB. The Labor Department said the core U.S. consumer price index rose 0.3 percent in August, the first time it has risen by that much for three consecutive months since the 1990s. If the report is a sign that the slowdown in inflation earlier this year truly was “transitory,” as Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has described it, it could call into question the need for further rate cuts as well as the historic low in bond yields. Real yields on 10-year Treasuries, which is the yield after subtracting inflation, fell to negative 0.89% at the end of August, the lowest since 1980, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Pronouncements that inflation is dead are “just not credible,” Bleakley Financial Group Chief Investment Officer Peter Boockvar wrote in a note to clients after the CPI report. “If we now see a continued rise in good prices, helped by tariffs, alongside stubborn services inflation, low inflation will not be the Fed’s problem.” Instead, it will be the bond market’s problem.
PREMATURE TWEET
Moments after the ECB announced further monetary stimulus, Trump tweeted that policy makers there are “trying, and succeeding, in depreciating the Euro against the VERY strong Dollar, hurting U.S. exports.” While the Bloomberg Euro Index did initially drop as much as 1.15%, it quickly erased those losses and rose as much as 0.50%. The bigger loser ended up being the greenback, with the Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index falling as much as 0.36% in its biggest drop in more than a week on the speculation that perhaps the ECB had reached the extent of what it can do with monetary policy. In many ways, the gyration in the world’s two most widely traded currencies was a sideshow to what was happening in emerging-market exchange rates. There, the MSCI Emerging-Market Currency Index soared as much as 0.77% in its biggest gain since June, a direct result of dollar weakness. This is good news for the global economy because every time the greenback lurches higher, doubts grow that emerging-market borrowers will be able to repay the trillions of dollar-denominated debt taken out in recent years. And in a sign that traders think the dollar may have topped out, inflows to U.S.-listed emerging-market ETFs that invest across developing nations as well as those that target specific countries totaled $74.9 million in the week ended Sept. 6, compared with gains of $69.4 million in the previous week, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Inflows total $381.9 million this year, meaning those two weeks accounted for 38% of all money that has poured into these funds in 2019.
OIL TAKES ANOTHER BEATING
In an otherwise good day for raw materials, with the Bloomberg Commodity Index up as much as 0.57%, the oil market fell for a third consecutive session. West Texas Intermediate futures fell to $55.10 a barrel, keeping prices below their year-to-date average and proving some support to the economy. The declines Thursday followed a report from the International Energy Agency that OPEC and its allies face a significant challenge in managing global supplies into 2020. The IEA said demand for the group’s crude in the first half of 2020 will be 1.4 million barrels a day below its August output as production surges from their competitors, including the U.S., according to Bloomberg News’s Alex Longley. Though an increase in stockpiles has taken a pause for now, growth in other countries, including Brazil and Norway, means that 2020 could experience a significant increase in oil stockpiles and pressure on prices. As an illustration of the challenge OPEC is facing, the U.S. briefly overtook Saudi Arabia as the world’s largest oil exporter in June, Longley reported. “The market is giving up on OPEC+ being able to support the price,” Ole Hansen, head of commodities strategy at Saxo Bank A/S, told Bloomberg News. “They can control production but not demand.” Of all the growing signs of a looming recession, oil is notably absent. Although prices are up about 21% this year, they are down 28% from last year’s peak in early October. This is significant because every economic downturn since 1970 has been preceded by a doubling of oil prices the prior 12 months, pressuring consumer spending, according to DataTrek Research.
TEA LEAVES
It’s generally accepted among economists that if it were not for the strength of the U.S. consumer, there’s a good chance the economy would probably already be in a recession given how fast the manufacturing sector has deteriorated. As such, any data point that provides some insight into the consumer has become even more important than usual, raising the stakes for Friday’s release of retail sales for August and the University of Michigan’s preliminary consumer sentiment report for September. Economists forecast that retail sales among a control group — which are used to calculate gross domestic product and exclude food services, auto dealers, building-material stores and gas stations — rose 0.3% last month after a bigger-than-expected jump of 1% in July. Still, that would just put retail sales growth back in line with the average over the past five years. The University of Michigan index posted a big drop in August, falling the most in six years, to a reading of 89.8 from 98.4 in July. Economists expect sentiment to have stabilized this month, forecasting a reading of 90.8. The thing to remember is that if both these reports come in below expectations, the Fed may feel increased pressure to cut rates next week by 50 basis points instead of the 25 basis point priced in by the market."

WPCT did not disclose any details about the holding, but said the adjustment would impact its net asset value by about 4 pence per share. 
Veteran money manager Woodford froze his flagship equity income fund on June 3 because it could not meet redemption requests, a move which has prompted an outcry from lawmakers and investors, a probe by regulators and share price losses or outflows from his other two funds.
Last month, the Woodford listed fund said Link would cut the valuation of its stake in IH Holdings, a unit of cold fusion technology firm Industrial Heat. This reduced its net asset value by 3.4 pence per share.
IH Holdings was one of WPCT's biggest holdings at end-April, the last month for which data is available, making up more than 10% of the portfolio. It delisted from the Guernsey stock exchange last month.
As of Sept. 11, the company's net asset value excluding income stood at 72.85 pence a share.

234,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 12, 2019 05:21PM ET</span>",Climate change pushes U.S. fund managers to bet on AC makers,"By David Randall
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Record heatwaves in Europe and Asia this summer are leading fund managers to buy shares of air conditioning manufacturers, betting that the public health risks of rising temperatures will compel businesses and apartment building owners to install cooling systems.
Shares of  Johnson Controls  (NYSE:JCI) International Plc, United Technologies Corp (NYSE:UTX), and Ingersoll-Rand Plc, are all up 25% or more since the start of the year, well above the 19% gain in the U.S. benchmark S&P 500 index. Those gains come despite concerns about slowing global economic growth due to the lingering trade war between the United States and China that have weighed on the industrial sector. 
Japanese companies Daikin Industries Ltd and Hitachi Ltd are also up strongly year-to-date.
Fund managers and analysts say the recent outperformance will likely continue due to the necessity of cooling systems as temperatures rise globally. Paris hit 42.6 degrees Celsius (108.7 Fahrenheit) in July, the highest in the city's recorded history, while Britain reported its hottest July on record. Heat waves contributed to the deaths of 1,435 people in France this summer, the country's health ministry said Sunday.
""This is an issue that isn't going away and it will certainly continue to drive adoption"" of air conditioning in regions that traditionally have not relied on it, said Rob McIver, a portfolio manager at Jensen Investment Management. McIver owns shares of United Technologies, which is spinning its Carrier business off into a separate company, expected to become independent next year. 
Europe will likely be a large growth market despite the outsized costs of retrofitting older buildings with new cooling systems, said Nicholas Heymann, co-group head – global industrial infrastructure at William Blair. Currently, only about 20% of European households have air conditioning, compared with 87% percent of U.S. households and 90% in Japan, due in part to greater emphasis on less energy-intensive forms of cooling in Europe. 
""It's something that's structurally more challenging in Europe, and conceptually too, because Europeans tend to be more environmentally-conscious. But personal safety is going to be a bigger issue and they are going to have to come to terms with retrofitting,"" he said. 
That market would likely be particularly lucrative for Johnson Controls International, where cooling systems make up approximately 50 percent of its revenues and it has a lead in so-called mini-split systems, which do not require expensive ducts to send cool air through buildings, Heymann said. 
The number of European households that buy and install a new air conditioning system will increase by an average of 4.3% a year through 2040 as more people move to cities, according to a study published in Environmental Science & Policy in July. Overall, global air conditioner sales will increase by 700 million units by 2030 and 1.6 billion by 2050, driven mostly by sales in developing countries such as India, according to estimates from the U.S. Department of Energy. 
A slowdown in new construction in Asia, which has accounted for the majority of the sector's growth, would likely weigh on the shares of air conditioning makers overall, said Noah Kaye, a senior analyst at Oppenheimer. Yet that could make companies such as Johnson Controls, which has seen its trailing price-to-earnings multiple jump nearly 72% over the last year, more attractive on a valuation standpoint, he said. 

""There is a real opportunity here that's under the radar"" if Europe begins to adopt greater usage of air conditioning than its historical trends, Kaye said. ""The use of air conditioning begets more air conditioning, and that's a trend we see continuing as the world gets hotter.""

235,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 12, 2019 05:15PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Two JPMorgan metals executives put on leave amid U.S. probe - source,"By Peter Hobson, Lawrence Delevingne and Koh Gui Qing
LONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Two JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) employees, including a top metals trading executive, have been placed on leave in response to a U.S. criminal investigation into the bank’s metals trading practices, according to a source familiar with the matter. 
Michael Nowak and Gregg Smith are on leave, the source said on Thursday, making them the third and fourth JPMorgan employees to be connected to the criminal investigation that has resulted in guilty pleas from two former JPMorgan metals traders. 
Nowak is a managing director and global head of base and precious metals trading in New York for the bank, according to his LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) profile. Smith’s title could not be learned. 
Nowak was placed on leave around late August, the source said. 
Neither Nowak nor Smith have been charged with a crime. 
Attorneys for Nowak did not respond to a request for comment. A call to Smith’s number at the bank was answered by an employee at the metals desk who directed questions to the bank’s public relations department. Reuters could not learn the identity of his lawyer. 
A spokesman for the Department of Justice declined to comment. 
JPMorgan, one of the largest gold trading banks in the world, said in an August regulatory filing it is “responding to and cooperating with” investigations by various authorities, including the Department of Justice, relating to trading practices in the metals markets. 
Spoofing involves placing bids to buy or offers to sell contracts with the intent to cancel them before execution. By creating an illusion of demand, spoofers can influence prices to benefit their market positions. 
There has been a surge in spoofing-related prosecutions in recent years. Bank of America Corp’s (N:BAC) Merrill Lynch commodities unit, for example, paid $25 million in July to resolve actions by the U.S. Commodities Futures Trading Commission and Department of Justice for precious metals spoofing trades between 2008 and 2014.
The Department of Justice already secured guilty pleas from two former JPMorgan metals traders, Christiaan Trunz and John Edmonds. The announcement of their pleas, in August 2019 and October 2018, respectively, indicated that they had collaborated on spoofing with their supervisors, who were not named. 
Trunz placed “thousands” of orders he did not plan to execute for gold, silver, platinum and palladium futures contracts between 2007 and 2016, and had learned to spoof from more senior traders, the Department of Justice said in August, adding that he was cooperating with “the ongoing investigation.” 
Nowak and another former JPMorgan trader, Robert Gottlieb, are named as defendants in at least one other civil suit related to metals spoofing at JPMorgan. A December 2018 class action complaint, for example, said that Edmonds, Nowak, Gottlieb and others made hundreds of spoof orders or more as “part of a conspiracy” with the bank and other internal traders.
An attorney for Gottlieb did not respond to a request for comment. Koch Industries Inc, Gottlieb’s last known employer, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
JPMorgan has also been sued separately by a group of investors, who said they lost money as a result of the bank spoofing its trades. In one of the lawsuits brought against the bank by Daniel Shak, a metals trader, Shak estimated he suffered immediate losses of around $25 million after he was forced to liquidate his position as a result of JPMorgan’s market manipulation, a court document showed. 

The civil suits against JPMorgan have been stayed pending the Department of Justice probe.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street advanced on Thursday, and the S&P 500 ended the session within striking distance of its all-time closing high, buoyed by positive developments on the U.S.-China trade front and a promise of continued stimulus from the European Central Bank.
Technology gains led the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq higher, while financials gave the biggest boost to the blue-chip Dow, which closed up for the seventh consecutive session, its longest winning streak since May.
Stocks rose worldwide as China and the United States made concessions ahead of next month's planned talks in Washington, aimed at easing a trade war that has whipsawed markets and stoked recessionary fears for months.
U.S. President Donald Trump agreed to delay increased tariffs on billions worth of Chinese goods for two weeks after China exempted tariffs on a basket of U.S. imports and promised to buy more U.S. agricultural products.
""It's good that (the United States and China are) talking and there appears to be less animosity,"" said Stephen Massocca, Senior Vice President at Wedbush Securities in San Francisco. ""The actual concessions that were made are immaterial, but the spirit they were made in is what the market views as more important."" 
Investor confidence got an early boost from the European Central Bank (ECB), which promised continued stimulus to the ailing euro zone economy through asset purchases.
David Carter, chief investment officer at Lenox Wealth Advisors in New York, expressed skepticism about the potential benefits of additional stimulus. 
""At this stage of the cycle, we're not sure if further ECB or Fed easing will have a meaningful fundamental impact given that rates have been so low for so long,"" Carter said.
The U.S. Federal Reserve is expected to cut key interest rates by 25 basis points next week, a move intended to head off signs of U.S. economic softening.
Such softening was not apparent in economic data released by the Labor Department on Thursday. Core consumer prices rose 2.4% in August, well above the Fed's 2% inflation target and jobless claims dropped more than expected last week.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) rose 45.41 points, or 0.17%, to 27,182.45, the S&P 500 (SPX) gained 8.64 points, or 0.29%, to 3,009.57 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) added 24.79 points, or 0.3%, to 8,194.47.

In addition, database giant Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) fell 4.3% on news that co-CEO Mark Hurd was taking leave to deal with a health issue.
Wynn rallied because of the day's big catalyst: the Trump administration's announcement late Wednesday that it will delay imposition of additional tariffs on Chinese goods. In addition, President Donald Trump tweeted China is expected to buy U.S. agriculture goods in ""large amounts,"" and China said it had inquired into prices of U.S. soybeans and pork.
The moves were seen as good-faith gestures to find a resolution to the U.S.-China trade war.

240,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 12, 2019 04:32PM ET</span>","Deutsche Bank is first to settle bond-rigging lawsuit, amid federal probe","By Jonathan Stempel
NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Deutsche Bank  AG (DE:DBKGn) will pay $15 million to resolve claims it conspired to rig prices of bonds issued by  Fannie Mae  (PK:FNMA) and  Freddie Mac  (PK:FMCC), becoming the first of 16 financial services companies to settle litigation by investors.
The German bank did not admit wrongdoing in agreeing to the settlement, which also requires that it bolster its antitrust compliance procedures and cooperate with the investors.
Court approval is required. The settlement was disclosed in filings late Wednesday in Manhattan federal court.
Investors including Pennsylvania Treasurer Joe Torsella accused several of the world's largest banks of exploiting their market dominance to overcharge for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac bonds from Jan. 1, 2009 to Jan. 1, 2016, and secure more profit for themselves.
The civil case began after a published report last year said the U.S. Department of Justice had opened a criminal probe into possible price-fixing in the bonds.
According to Wednesday's filings, Deutsche Bank agreed in May to share information with the investors about other banks accused of price-fixing, in connection with its having received leniency in a related federal criminal antitrust case.
The Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Deutsche Bank spokesman Troy Gravitt said the bank was pleased to settle with the investors.
Lawyers for the investors called Deutsche Bank's settlement an ""ice-breaker"" that could bring other defendants to the negotiating table.
""This agreement is an important first step, but just a first step, toward greater accountability on Wall Street,"" Torsella said in a statement.
According to an amended complaint on Tuesday, the defendants underwrote $3.97 trillion, or 77.2%, of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac bonds in the seven-year period.
Deutsche Bank's 6.95% market share was the fourth-largest, trailing  Barclays  Plc (L:BARC), JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) and UBS Group AG (S:UBSG).
On Sept. 3, U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff in Manhattan said investors could sue Deutsche Bank and four other banks, calling chat room transcripts involving their traders ""direct evidence of a conspiracy to fix prices"" and a ""rare smoking gun.""
Rakoff dismissed claims against the other 11 defendants, but Tuesday's complaint was intended to address his concerns.

241,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 12, 2019 03:11PM ET</span>","Brazilian lithium producer Sigma in talks with Tesla, other automakers","By Christian Plumb
BELO HORIZONTE, Brazil (Reuters) - Brazil-based lithium startup Sigma Lithium Resources Corp (V:SGMA) has held talks with Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) and other automakers about supplying the key battery ingredient in the coming years, the company's chief executive said on Thursday.
Sigma, which recently received its license to begin hard rock lithium mining in the Brazilian state of Minas Gerais, met with Tesla supplier Ganfeng Lithium (SZ:002460), at the automaker's request. But it is holding off on a deal because of the terms the Chinese company is demanding, Chief Executive Calvyn Gardner said in an interview.
""There's a bunch of other things that they need, not just prices, but other demands which are a little more complicated that sort of restricts Sigma to almost supplying purely into China,"" Gardner said on the sidelines of a Brazilian mining conference. ""It's not really what we think we should be doing over the long term.""
Although lithium prices have slumped in the past year, Sigma and other producers hope to benefit from a long-awaited boom in electric car production when prices of the vehicles become more competitive.
He added that Sigma would prefer to ship its lithium directly to Tesla in California, although that can only happen once makers of cathodes, one of the two main battery components, set up shop in the United States.
Gardner said he is a ""big fan"" of Tesla, to the point where he tried to import one of the company's Model 3 sedans for personal use into Brazil, where the electric car maker has no dealerships. He gave up after discovering the car would cost $75,000 given Brazilian import taxes, rather than the roughly $35,000 U.S. price including tax credits.
Sigma, which would be among the world's lowest-cost suppliers of the mineral, has also held informal talks with German automakers Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) and BMW (DE:BMWG).
""Having options to get lithium from other jurisdictions and that you can supply over the long term, that's what all of them are interested in and we think Sigma can do that,"" Gardner said.
Sigma in April struck an alliance with Japan's Mitsui (T:8031) which included $30 million in funding for its planned commercial production plant. In return, Mitsui will get roughly a third of the mine's initial planned output of 220,000 tonnes.
The alliance will help Sigma move closer to automakers given Mitsui's partnerships with Asian battery makers which in turn supply the carmakers, he said."

As a standalone company, Old Navy, which offers more affordable clothing and accessories, plans to open 860 stores in North America and said it would focus on opening outlets in smaller markets and off-mall locations. https:// Old Navy, which recorded net sales of about $8 billion in 2018 and ended the year with 1,140 locations, said with the new store openings it plans to reach more than $10 billion in annual sales in the long term.
Earlier this year, Gap announced that it would spin off the Old Navy brand, a bright spot for the struggling retailer, into a publicly listed company. Gap, Athleta, Banana Republic and the remaining brands will be part of the new Gap Inc.
""What separation does for us is allows us to have the focus that we need to deliver with confidence this strategy which we know is the right one,"" Old Navy Chief Executive Officer Sonia Syngal said on an investor call held to provide an update on the planned separation, expected to be completed by 2020.
Old Navy's plans to open new stores comes as Gap and other brick-and-mortar players have been shutting underperforming locations bowing to pressure from online sellers, fast-fashion retailers and ever-changing consumer trends.
For the Gap brand, the company said it plans to focus on the denim category, while also working towards improving margins.
""We're going to gain share in denim and that is going to be the fuel that powers (a) turnaround,"" Gap Inc CEO Art Peck said on the investor call.
Gap also expects $400 million to $450 million in one-time separation expenses and $300 million to $350 million in capital-related costs between 2019 and 2021."

(Reuters) - A grand jury in Alaska this week indicted General Electric's Baker Hughes (N:BHGE), two of its subsidiaries and an employee, for 25 felony charges of assault relating to toxic chemical releases at a construction site, according to authorities.
The indictment charges Baker Hughes and John Clyde Willis, identified as a manager for the oilfield services company. The 25 charges stem from chemical releases in 2014 during building of a chemical transfer facility in Kenai, Alaska, according to a statement from Alaska's Attorney General's office.
Construction crew at the facility were repeatedly exposed to toxic chemicals, the statement said, but Baker Hughes, two of its subsidiaries and Willis failed to respond to worker complaints until several were taken to hospital following a ""large exposure event.""
Five crew members experienced prolonged serious injury, including ataxia, memory loss, migraines, vertigo, respiratory issues and tremors, according to the statement.
Willis could not immediately be reached for comment.
Baker Hughes said it was committed to safety and that it operates its oilfield services facility in Kenai in compliance with the law.
""We vigorously deny the claims made against us, and will exercise our right to present evidence that the allegations are without merit.  We have confidence in the judicial system and that the full facts will be presented in court,” a spokesperson said.
The company and Wallis have been indicted on 10 counts of first degree assault, 10 counts of second degree assault, and five counts of third degree assault.
If convicted, Baker Hughes and its units could face fines totaling $2.5 million. Willis could face 20 years in prison and a $250,000 fine if convicted of the most serious allegations."

PARIS (Reuters) - Google agreed to pay close to 1 billion euros ($1.10 billion) to French authorities to settle a fiscal fraud probe that began four years ago in a deal that may create a legal precedent for other large tech companies present in the country. 
French investigators have been seeking to establish whether Google, whose European headquarters are based in Dublin, failed to pay its dues to the state by avoiding to declare parts of its activities in the country. 
The settlement comprises a fine of 500 million euros and additional taxes of 465 million euros, Google said in a statement. 
Google, part of Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc, pays little tax in most European countries because it reports almost all sales in Ireland. This is possible thanks to a loophole in international tax law but it hinges on staff in Dublin concluding all sales contracts.
""(The agreement allows) to settle once for all these past disputes,"" said Antonin Levy, one of Google's lawyers, at a hearing in the Paris court. 
The combined tax payment is less than the 1.6 billion euros the finance ministry had been seeking from Google after the company's Paris offices were raided in 2016. At the time, the ministry had ruled out settling with the company. 
Budget Minister Gerald Darmanin told Le Figaro newspaper on Thursday the settlement would create a legal precedent and added that talks were underway with several other companies, big and small. He did not specify their names. 
European countries have struggled to tax the profits of multinational tech companies derived in their jurisdictions.
France has pushed hard for a digital tax to cover European Union member states, but ran up against resistance from Ireland, Denmark, Sweden and Finland.
The French government has eventually imposed its own unilateral tax, prompting U.S. President Donald Trump to brandish the menace of a retaliatory tax on French wine. 

""We remain convinced that a coordinated reform of the international tax system is the best way to provide a clear framework for companies operating worldwide,"" Google said.

(Reuters) - European stocks edged higher in choppy trading on Thursday, with banks underwhelmed by the European Central Bank's stimulus measures while Washington's move to delay tariffs on Chinese goods boosted automakers and technology firms.
The pan-European stocks index (STOXX) gained as much as 0.8% after the ECB cut its deposit rate to a record low of -0.5% from -0.4% and said it will restart bond purchases of 20 billion euros a month from November.
That initially sent bond yields tumbling, the euro down and euro zone stocks (STOXXE) into positive territory.
Gains in the STOXXE index wore off as the session progressed, however, with euro zone banks (SX7E) swinging on the news that the ECB was easing the terms of its cheap loan scheme to banks and introducing a tiered deposit rate.
""I don't think this is a game changer,"" said Pictet Asset Management's chief strategist Luca Paolini.
""Even if it was a positive surprise in some areas, there were negative surprises overall. They basically did what the market expected and they've done it many times in the past."" 
Euro zone banks - one of the main beneficiaries of an investor pivot into value stocks in recent days - closed 0.24% higher, while broader European banks (SX7P) finished unchanged. 
Italian banks (FTIT8300), which have big holdings of sovereign bonds, were an outperformer with a 1.2% gain, owing to a recent surge in Italian government bond prices.
Trade headlines also swayed markets, with automakers (SXAP) jumping on a report that the Trump administration was considering an interim deal with China, although CNBC said that a senior White House official denied the report.
Offering relief to battered financial markets, President Donald Trump said the United States would delay increasing tariffs on $250 billion worth of Chinese imports by two weeks as ""a gesture of good will"".
Optimism about a de-escalation in the economically damaging China-U.S. trade war and expectations of monetary stimulus from the ECB have led major European indices to track higher this week.
Energy stocks (SXEP) were a big drag, falling 1.3%, as oil prices fell on oversupply concerns. [O/R]
Among individual stocks,  Anheuser-Busch InBev  (BR:ABI) was the biggest boost to the STOXX 600 after the company said it would again explore an initial public offering in Hong Kong for its Asia Pacific unit two months after cancelling the planned listing.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - CommonGrounds Workplace has raised an additional $40 million from existing investors as it bets on a proprietary movable-wall system it hopes will reduce costs as it builds out a national flexible workspace network, the company said Thursday.
The San Diego-based company has eight locations after raising $100 million in January, and expects to open 21 by March 2020 as part of a two-year plan to have 50 locations and become one of the biggest flexible workspace operators in the country.
Plans call for a 2 million square feet (186,000 square meters) footprint, which today would put it on par with Knotel, the third-largest U.S. flex space operator after industry leaders, The We Company's WeWork and IWG Plc (L:IWG).
With the new, reusable alternative to drywall that it says will be an industry game-changer, CommonGrounds expects to cut operating costs, which have been under scrutiny because of rival WeWork's massive losses https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-wework-ipo/wework-to-test-ipo-investor-appetite-with-widening-losses-idUKKCN1V4154 ahead of an initial public offering.
""It's definitely a very sustainable product. We're not going to get to zero drywall, but we're going to get to a place where we'll have a lot less drywall than we have today,"" Bates said.
The walls, developed with Italy's Tecno SpA, have built-in electricity and internet cable, connect to heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems and will reduce future demolition and construction costs of building offices, the company said.
The trend is for companies to reduce leasing terms to two or three years from a typical 10-year contract, leading to the steady demolition of gypsum-based ""drywall"" panels, Chief Executive Jacob Bates told Reuters.
CommonGrounds, which has exclusive rights for Tecno's product in flexible workspaces, is seeking a U.S. patent for the movable walls.
The installation of two 12-foot (3.66-meter) sections of its wall system took four hours at its Denver site, instead of at least a week using drywall, the company said."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court on Thursday upheld the conviction of a former  HSBC Holdings  Plc (L:HSBA) executive who was sentenced to two years in prison for defrauding  Cairn Energy  Plc (L:CNE) in a $3.5 billion currency trade.
A unanimous three-judge panel of the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan ruled that a jury had enough evidence to find that Mark Johnson, formerly head of HSBC’s global foreign exchange cash trading desk, withheld material information from Cairn.
A lawyer for Johnson could not immediately be reached for comment. A spokesman for the prosecutors declined to comment.
Johnson, a British citizen, was convicted of fraud in October 2017 in a federal court in the New York City borough of Brooklyn after a nearly four-week trial. He was the first banker to be tried in the United States as a result of worldwide investigations of the multitrillion-dollar per day currency market.
The probes have led to billions of dollars in fines against several banks and the firing of dozens of traders.
According to court filings, Cairn hired HSBC in 2011 to convert $3.5 billion into British pounds sterling in connection with the sale of an Indian subsidiary.
U.S. prosecutors said Johnson and another former HSBC executive, Stuart Scott, devised a scheme to drive up the price of pounds by executing a series of trades before carrying out the trade for Cairn.
Such trading in advance of a client's order to make a profit is known as ""front-running.""
On appeal, Johnson argued that front-running is not illegal and that the deal was beneficial to Cairn.
""But Johnson was not convicted of frontrunning,"" the appeals court wrote Thursday. ""He was convicted of making material misrepresentations to Cairn about how HSBC would trade ahead of the fix and the price would be determined.""
Evidence that Johnson had misled Cairn was enough to support the conviction, the court found.
U.S. prosecutors also charged Scott, but Britain's Supreme Court last year blocked his extradition to the United States. Johnson had chosen not to fight extradition."

(Reuters) - When Apple Inc (O:AAPL) introduced its triple-camera iPhone this week, marketing chief Phil Schiller waxed on about the device's ability to create the perfect photograph by weaving it together with eight separate exposures captured before the main shot, a feat of ""computational photography mad science.""
""When you press the shutter button it takes one long exposure, and then in just one second the neural engine analyzes the fused combination of long and short images, picking the best among them, selecting all the pixels, and pixel by pixel, going through 24 million pixels to optimize for detail and low noise,"" Schiller said, describing a feature called ""Deep Fusion"" that will ship later this fall.
It was the kind of technical digression that, in years past, might have been reserved for design chief Jony Ive's narration of a precision aluminum milling process to produce the iPhone's clean lines. But in this case, Schiller, the company's most enthusiastic photographer, was heaping his highest praise on custom silicon and artificial intelligence software.
The technology industry's battleground for smartphone cameras has moved inside the phone, where sophisticated artificial intelligence software and special chips play a major role in how a phone's photos look.
""Cameras and displays sell phones,"" said Julie Ask, vice president and principal analyst at Forrester.
Apple added a third lens to the iPhone 11 Pro model, matching the three-camera setup of rivals like  Samsung Electronics Co Ltd  (KS:005930) and Huawei Technologies Co Ltd [HWT.UL], already a feature on their flagship models.
But Apple also played catch-up inside the phone, with some features such as ""night mode,"" a setting designed to make low-light photos look better. Apple will add that mode to its new phones when they ship on Sept. 20, but Huawei and Alphabet Inc's (O:GOOGL) Google Pixel have had similar features since last year.
In making photos look better, Apple is trying to gain an advantage by way of the custom chip that powers its phone. During the iPhone 11 Pro launch, executives spent more time talking its processor - dubbed the A13 Bionic - than the specs of the newly added lens.
A special portion of that chip called the ""neural engine,"" which is reserved for artificial intelligence tasks, aims to help the iPhone take better, sharper pictures in challenging lighting situations.
Samsung and Huawei also design custom chips for their phones, and even Google has custom ""Visual Core"" silicon that helps with its Pixel's photography tasks.
Ryan Reith, the program vice president for research firm IDC's mobile device tracking program, said that has created an expensive game in which only phone makers with enough resources to create custom chips and software can afford to invest in custom camera systems that set their devices apart.
Even very cheap handsets now feature two and three cameras on the back of the phone, he said, but it is the chips and software that play a huge role in whether the resulting images look stunning or so-so.
""Owning the stack today in smartphones and chipsets is more important than it's ever been, because the outside of the phone is commodities,"" Reith said.
The custom chips and software powering the new camera system take years to develop. But in Apple's case, the research and development work could prove useful later in products such as augmented reality glasses, which many industry experts believe Apple has under development.
""It's all being built up for the bigger story down the line - augmented reality, starting in phones and eventually other products,"" Reith said."
263,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 12, 2019 09:06AM ET</span>",Departure of Nissan's Saikawa hastened by independent directors: sources,"By Naomi Tajitsu, Maki Shiraki and Laurence Frost
TOKYO/PARIS (Reuters) - The fate of Nissan CEO Hiroto Saikawa was sealed by two external directors who persuaded the board on Monday to oust the company veteran and spare the carmaker more reputational damage after a string of high-profile scandals, two sources said.
Outside directors Jenifer Rogers and Keiko Ihara, members of corporate governance committees created in the aftermath of the arrest of former chairman Carlos Ghosn, pushed for Saikawa's departure at a board meeting that went on for several hours at Nissan Motor's (T:7201) Yokohama headquarters, the sources said.
Ihara, a Japanese racing driver, and Rogers, an American lawyer, also lobbied to install Saikawa's right-hand man, Yasuhiro Yamauchi, as interim CEO until a successor was found, the two sources with knowledge of the meeting said.
The intervention suggests that even as the automaker was wrestling with its worst crisis since Ghosn's dramatic fall from grace, it took pressure from company outsiders to oust his former protege.
Nissan said on Monday that Saikawa will resign on Sept. 16, after he admitted to being improperly overpaid by $440,000.
The stand taken by Ihara and Rogers, the only women on Nissan's board, is also a rare example of the influence of foreigners and women in Japanese boardrooms, which was almost unheard of a few decades ago.
Nissan declined to comment.
""To improve Nissan's relationship with its dealers, suppliers and customers, Rogers argued that Saikawa had to leave,"" said one of the sources, who declined to be identified because the information has not been made public.
Saikawa's departure is just the latest upheaval for a company battered by the Ghosn scandal, a plunge in profit and a strained relationship with France's  Renault  (PA:RENA), its biggest shareholder and automaking alliance partner.
Saikawa, who had worked for Nissan for 42 years, had long pledged to turn the company around before ""passing the baton"" to the next generation, a phrase he frequently repeated.
STRAINED ALLIANCE
In June, Nissan set up a trio of committees to improve its governance. Rogers, a former Fulbright scholar, joined the audit and compensation committees. Ihara was named chair of the compensation committee and sits on the nominations committee.
Rogers was the first to argue persuasively that Saikawa should step down and other board members then echoed her view, said an alliance source, who was briefed on the meeting.
Another board member, Renault Chairman Jean-Dominique Senard, had not advocated for Saikawa's departure but supported the proposal, the alliance source said.
Renault sources have acknowledged some concern that Saikawa's exit could interrupt talks underway on reforming their strained alliance, prolonging uncertainty over its direction.
Yamauchi, who will take over as temporary chief executive, is expected to stay in that post until October, when a permanent replacement is due to be appointed.
The frontrunners so far include the head of Nissan's China operations and an executive tasked with leading Nissan's revival, Reuters reported earlier.
One board member initially voiced concern that asking for Saikawa's immediate resignation would be rash and that he should stay until a successor was found, one of the two sources said.
In the end, the decision was unanimous, and Saikawa was told he must go, a fourth person familiar with the matter said.
Hours later, he sat in front of a room full of reporters and said he would pass the baton - within a week."
264,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 12, 2019 08:51AM ET</span>","Bonds Surge, Euro Declines as ECB Unveils Open-Ended Debt Buying","(Bloomberg) -- Italian bonds led a regional debt rally and the euro fell after the European Central Bank cut interest rates and announced a fresh program of open-ended asset purchases to support the region’s ailing economy.
The common currency slid toward a two-year low as the monetary institution said it would lower its deposit rate by 10 basis points to -0.50% and expand its 2.6 trillion euro ($2.9 trillion) bond-buying program from November at a pace of 20 billion euros per month. The ECB also said it would introduce a two-tier system for negative rate policy.
Italian bonds led the rally across euro-area debt, with 10-year yields sliding to a record low. The nation’s bonds will be among the major beneficiaries from a restart of the quantitative easing program, while the ECB is closer to its purchase limits in countries such as Germany. Yield curves across the region flattened.
“The ECB’s has delivered on all fronts -- a new QE program, policy rate cuts, easier terms of TLTROs and tiering,” said Pooja Kumra, European rates strategist at Toronto-Dominion Bank. “The size of QE and cut did come as a bit of disappointment, But we think rally is supported by the persistence of long-term easing by ECB.”
Bond yields across much of the euro area dropped into negative territory this year amid expectations for more stimulus from the ECB in the face of growing geopolitical risks from Brexit to the U.S.-China trade war. The euro touched its lowest level in over two years earlier this month.
The shared currency was 0.5% weaker at $1.0959 as of 1:15 p.m. in London, just above a two-year low of $1.0926 touched earlier this month. German 10-year bond yields dropped eight basis points to -0.64%, while Italian equivalents plummeted as much as 19 basis points to 0.78%. Yields on 10-year Treasuries dropped five basis points to 1.69%.
“Markets like the opened-ended QE,” said Arne Lohmann Rasmussen, head of fixed-income research at Danske Bank A/S. “It’s very positive for semi-core and periphery given the open-ended QE.”"
265,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 12, 2019 08:26AM ET</span>",Britain won't run out of toilet paper but fruit could be in short supply after Brexit,"By Alistair Smout and Noor Zainab Hussain
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain is unlikely to run out of essentials like toilet paper in the event of a no-deal Brexit but some fresh fruit and vegetables could be in short supply and prices might rise, warned supermarket bosses on Thursday.
Retailers John Lewis and Co-Operative Group and the government's reluctant publication of a report late on Wednesday, shed light on what shoppers might expect to find, or not find on supermarket shelves after October 31.
The government has demanded that supermarkets prepare for a potentially chaotic no-deal Brexit by stockpiling food, but supermarket bosses say it is almost impossible to store fresh food for any length of time and people might not find everything they want on the shelves.
Steve Murrells, Chief Executive of the Co-op, said that the firm had secured extra storage space but he expected shortages in some fresh food and subsequent price rises.
""We are very clear on where we think inflation will come through, which will be, in the main, fruit,"" he said.
""We would be stockpiling the essential items that you would expect. Water, toilet paper, long life cans.""
Murrells said that fruit like apples, pears, blueberries and strawberries might have to be transported more expensively via air freight from the Southern (NYSE:SO) hemisphere to avoid congested ports.
The availability of vegetables in Britain is also at risk as the European Union provides some 86% of lettuces and 70% of tomatoes, according to the British Retail Consortium (BRC).
""Clearly... in short-life fresh produce that's imported from Europe, that would be harder, if the flow of stock is interrupted,"" Rob Collins, the managing director of John Lewis' supermarket group Waitrose, told reporters.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson has pledged to take Britain out of the European Union with or without a deal on Oct. 31, and has said he will not ask for a delay despite lawmakers voting that he seeks one to avoid a no-deal Brexit.
The ""Operation Yellowhammer"" report on the worst case scenario released by the government pointed to potential problems snarling up cross-Channel trade routes and disrupting supplies of fresh food.
John Lewis Chairman Charlie Mayfield said the assessment chimed with what his department store and supermarket group expected from a no-deal scenario.
""The publication of the Yellowhammer documents gives a bit more insight, but frankly I don't think it tells us anything particularly new that we didn't already know,"" Mayfield told reporters after warning that the impact of a no-deal Brexit could be ""significant"".
Mayfield went on to say that the continuing uncertainty meant that consumer confidence had taken a battering and John Lewis was seeing a reluctance by consumers to make big ticket purchases in its department stores.
David Potts, Chief Executive of grocer Morrisons, agreed that consumer confidence was weak but the grocer is somewhat shielded from any Brexit chaos as two thirds of what it sells is British.
While supermarkets say they are restricted in what goods they can stockpile, there might be some solace in the fact that they say so far, customers have shown little sign of panic-buying."

HONG KONG (Reuters) -  Anheuser-Busch InBev  (BR:ABI) is planning to raise about $5 billion from a revived float of its Asian operations after the world's largest beer maker shelved a Hong Kong IPO in July, people with knowledge of the matter said.
AB InBev, which had aimed to raise as much as $9.8 billion through an IPO of  Budweiser Brewing Company APAC Ltd  (HK:1876) to help with its heavy debt burden of over $100 billion, aims to re-launch the float as soon as next week, the sources said.
It is tentatively looking to price the deal on September 23 and list the unit on September 30, said two sources who declined to be identified as the information was private.
The listing would be a boost for the Hong Kong Stock Exchange after Reuters reported last month that China's biggest e-commerce company  Alibaba  Group Holding Ltd (N:BABA) had delayed a Hong Kong listing worth up to $15 billion amid growing political unrest there.
""The market conditions in recent days have improved and provided a good window, in which we should seize the opportunity to go ahead,"" said one of the sources.
Last Wednesday, Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam formally withdrew an extradition bill, part of measures she hoped would help the city move forward from months of unrest.
The benchmark Hang Seng Index has surged more than 6% since then.
The development also comes after Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Ltd (HK:0388) announced a $39 billion takeover approach to the  London Stock Exchange  Plc (L:LSE) on Wednesday that received a cool response from investors concerned about regulatory and financial hurdles.
AB InBev said in a statement on Thursday that it was continuing to explore an IPO in Hong Kong of Budweiser APAC, two months after shelving the planned listing of up to $9.8 billion in what would have been the largest IPO of 2019.
Budweiser APAC has resumed its application for the listing of a minority stake of its shares on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, excluding its Australian operations, which the parent agreed to sell to Japan's Asahi Group (T:2502) for $11 billion shortly after the IPO was shelved in July.
Without Australia, a large but mature market, AB InBev's Asia-Pacific operations would be more focused on faster growth markets such as China, India and Vietnam, which in a way could make the IPO more attractive, sources said.
The brewer, which had billed the IPO as a means to drive regional consolidation, failed to secure enough solid orders from top-class U.S. ""long only"" fund managers as investors were unwilling to accept its $54 billion-$64 billion valuation for Budweiser APAC in July.
Another source, however, said Budweiser APAC stripped on the profitable Australia business would be worth less than $54 billion, the bottom of the previous range.
In the latest prospectus filed with the stock exchange, the company booked a first-quarter normalized EBITDA of $558 million, up 23% from a year earlier.
The growth rate including the Australian unit over the same period was 13.4%, filings showed.
Budweiser APAC declined to comment on the IPO details. AB InBev did not respond to a request for comment.
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) are the sponsors of the float."

270,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 12, 2019 07:16AM ET</span>","Where's the fake beef? Not at Kraft Heinz, investors worry","By Richa Naidu and Siddharth Cavale
CHICAGO (Reuters) - Investors are chewing out Kraft Heinz Co (O:KHC) for failing to lay out a full strategy for how it plans to compete in the roughly $3 billion-a-year plant-based protein market.
At the Kraft Heinz annual meeting to be held in Pittsburgh on Thursday, shareholders will vote on a proposal asking the company to reveal its long-term strategy for imitation meat and alternative proteins.
Products by rivals  Beyond Meat Inc  (O:BYND) and Impossible Foods have become the hottest food trend in recent years, gaining popularity among mainstream consumers looking to cut back on meat consumption.
""It's a fast-growing market and they've been really silent with investors on how they plan to tackle that,"" said Kyle Kempf, a spokesman for Green Century Funds, which proposed the proxy vote and owns a more than $460,000 stake in Kraft Heinz.
Kraft Heinz has been ranked one of the least proactive major food makers in the plant-based protein market, according to FAIRR, a major investor coalition that includes several Kraft Heinz shareholders. The company's main meat-alternative brand, 40-year-old BOCA Burger, has lost market share since 2013.
""Any company ranking at the bottom clearly has some catching up to do,"" said Peter van der Werf, head of responsible investment management at Robeco, which owns an $9.6 million stake in Kraft Heinz.
Robeco and another Kraft Heinz investor, NN Investment Partners, told Reuters they were inclined to support the investor demand that Kraft Heinz cough up more specifics about its alternative-protein strategy. Neither company would disclose whether they will vote for the proposal, which Kraft Heinz's board of directors has recommended rejecting.
Kraft Heinz, which took a $15.4 billion writedown this year on its Kraft and Oscar Mayer brands, has been criticized for spending too little on innovation and marketing after years of cost cuts under managers from 3G Capital, Kraft Heinz's No. 2 shareholder. Since the writedown, the company's shares have fallen about 40%.
BOCA LOSES SIZZLE
BOCA Burger, credited by some as the original U.S. veggie burger for the masses, was bought by the then-Kraft Foods in 2000. One problem for the aging BOCA Burger, however, is that the current alternative-meat craze is actually being driven not by vegetarians, but by so-called flexitarians - meat-eaters who occasionally buy alternative-protein products. To appeal to these shoppers, Beyond Meat and other upstarts are convincing grocers to stock their products next to fresh-looking animal burgers in chilled-meat cases.
BOCA Burgers, by contrast, are frozen and sit in refrigerators with vegetarian and vegan products, where meat-eaters may not think to look.
 Kroger Co  (N:KR), one of the first grocers to sell Beyond Meat patties in meat cases, said on Tuesday it was testing a plant-based protein section in the meat departments of 60 stores to gauge shopper behavior.
BOCA Burger's share of the U.S. plant-based burger market shrank to 3.8% last year, compared with 7.3% in 2013, according to Euromonitor.
Kraft Heinz declined to provide details on its plans for plant-based proteins or comment on the forthcoming shareholder vote. In a filing ahead of the meeting, Kraft Heinz said several named executives had forfeited their bonuses for 2018 due to the company's performance. Chief Executive Officer Miguel Patricio, who took the helm in July, said last month that the company needed to better understand consumers and was ""far behind the plant-based market.""
Spokeswoman Lynne Galia said Kraft Heinz had increased BOCA sales over the past year, driven by changes to the taste, texture and packaging of its products. ""We are committed to ensuring our BOCA products maintain meaningful competitive claims versus meat products, as well as competitive claims in the category as it evolves,"" Galia said.
But BOCA's new boxes lack the ""plant-based"" buzzword, and tout an ""All American Veggie Burger"" at a time when rivals lure meat-eaters by avoiding terms like ""vegan"" or ""vegetarian.""
Faryda Lindeman, a senior responsible investment specialist at NN Investment Partners, said big companies including Kraft Heinz that had fallen behind in the plant-based market were likely set in their ways and did not want to invest in new risks. NN Investment holds a $9.4 million stake in Kraft Heinz.
""The only thing they can do is to buy other companies of course, they have a lot of cash,"" Lindeman said. 3G Capital is known for scoring big M&A deals to drive growth, but new Kraft Heinz CEO Patricio said when his appointment was announced in April that his focus, for now, would be on expanding existing brands."

U.S. President Donald Trump delayed an increase in tariffs on Chinese goods by two weeks, after China exempted some U.S. drugs and other goods from tariffs. The two moves buoyed stock markets from Asia to Europe and put pressure on safe assets like the Japanese yen.
MSCI's world equity index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, rose 0.1% to its highest since Aug. 1. It was on course for its seventh straight day of gains, its best winning streak in since early June. 
Europe's Euro STOXX 600 climbed to its highest in nearly seven weeks, then gave up the gains. Paris and London markets also relinquished early gains, though Frankfurt held onto a 0.2% advance. Wall Street futures gauges were up 0.1%.
Some analysts said investors were getting too eager for good news on the U.S.-China trade war. The prospects of a quick resolution were still remote, they warned. 
""I don't think we're heading for a deal soon,"" said Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Markets.com. ""The market is just buying on any kind of positive news – it seems hungry for anything. It's setting itself up for a bit of disappointment.""
The ECB's move, due at 1145 GMT, also carries a risk of overly optimistic market expectations, investors said. 
Major central banks worldwide are loosening monetary policy, inflation expectations are sliding and the powerhouse German economy is at risk of recession. Consequently, ECB President Mario Draghi has all but promised more support.
But the central bank's exact moves are far from certain, and any decision that underwhelms markets could push up borrowing costs. 
Among the likely measures are a cut in the ECB's record-low minus 0.4% deposit rate, a multi-tier deposit rate, and new guidance on rates that would tie any move to certain inflation conditions.
A new round of bond buying, the bank's most potent weapon, is also an option - but policymakers from Germany to France are sceptical about that move. 
""We could see some disappointment here. The challenge is more about forward guidance and reassurance for the future,"" said Christophe Barraud, chief economist at Market Securities in Paris.
""It would be surprising if the ECB launches a big stimulus right now ahead of uncertainties such as hard Brexit and the trade war.""
After the ECB decision, the U.S. Federal Reserve is expected to cut rates next Wednesday and the Bank of Japan and Swiss National Bank next Thursday also may ease. 
BONDS CALM, YUAN RISES
Euro zone government bonds were steady in early trade, after rising from record lows reached a week ago on doubts that the ECB would resume asset purchases.
""Whether the ECB cuts rates by 10 or 20 bps is neither here or there,"" said Chris Scicluna, head of economic research at Daiwa Capital Markets. ""The big question is whether they restart QE, and if they don't, we will see a further sell-off in bonds, especially longer-dated ones.""
The optimism over trade and the looming ECB decision were felt in currency markets, too. 
The euro fell to a one-week low of $1.0983 overnight on expectations of ECB easing before steadying in morning trade. It has shed 3.5% since June. 
With risk-hungry investors emboldened, the Chinese yuan gained 0.4% against the dollar, touching a three-week high of 7.0855. 
Stephen Gallo, European head of FX strategy at BMO Capital Markets, said he was surprised by the rebound, particularly in the yuan pushing beyond 7.10 to the dollar. 
""The bigger picture is one of a very tense geopolitical environment that is unlikely to be rectified quickly,"" he said.
The Japanese yen, a safe haven for nervous investors, fell to a six-week low against the dollar, and was last down 0.1% at 107.88.
Brent crude futures fell as a meeting of the OPEC+ alliance yielded no discussion about increasing supply cuts. They focused instead on bringing Nigerian and Iraqi output down to their agreed quotas.
Brent crude futures fell 69 cents, or 1.1%, to $60.12 a barrel by 1055 GMT, heading for a third session of losses.

272,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 12, 2019 06:47AM ET</span>","BAT stubs out 2,300 jobs as new CEO tackles tobacco sector changes","By Pushkala Aripaka and Siddharth Cavale
(Reuters) -  British American Tobacco  (L:BATS) plans to lay off 4% of its workforce, including a fifth of senior managers, as recently-promoted chief executive Jack Bowles grapples with challenges to the group's legacy products and health fears over vaping.
Shares of the second-largest tobacco company by sales were up 1.6 %, the biggest boost to the broader FTSE index (FTSE) on Thursday, after the maker of Lucky Strike and Dunhill cigarettes said it will cut 2,300 roles as it eliminates duplication and consolidates business units.
The move by BAT, which employed more than 56,000 people at the end of last year, 629 of them senior managers, comes a day after President Donald Trump said that the U.S. would remove all flavored e-cigarettes from shelves, as officials warned millions of children had been drawn into nicotine addiction.
""Today's announcement represents a bold first step for new chief executive Jack Bowles, but he must hope the crackdown on vaping doesn't see his growth ambitions run out of puff,"" said Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell. 
BAT sells the Vuse e-cigarette in the United States, a product it acquired after buying U.S. rival Reynolds American (NYSE:RAI) for $49 billion in 2017. It also sells the Vype e-cigarette devices in many European markets, including the United Kingdom. Both are available with e-liquid flavorings.
There has been growing concern on the safety of vaping after health officials reported 450 cases of vaping-related lung illness and six deaths linked to its use in the United States.
Since taking charge in April, insider Bowles has promised to slim down BAT, which was slow to react to the vaping craze in the United States, the market which generates nearly 45% of its annual profits, partly allowing rival Altria-backed (N:MO) Juul to capture nearly three-quarters of the new market.
Bowles said in June that BAT would pour more money into its ""new category"" business - which makes tobacco heating products, e-cigarettes and nicotine pouches - and consolidate them into three main brands as sales of traditional cigarettes decline. 
BAT said the planned job cuts would help save money that can be reinvested in the growth of its portfolio and deliver on its target of generating 5 billion pounds ($6.2 billion) of revenue in ""new categories"" by 2023-24.
It expects the business to generate constant currency revenue of 1.19 billion-1.375 billion pounds this fiscal year.
However, Liberum analyst Nico von Stackelberg was puzzled by the laying off of senior managers when BAT was seeking growth.
""You are going to lose people that know the business, a market or a certain category or why something was done one way,"" von Stackelberg said. 

""It's not great for the business in that regard.""

U.S. equity futures and Treasuries rose.
The Stoxx Europe 600 Index edged higher, advancing a third day as contracts on the S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial and Nasdaq 100 gauges all pointed to positive open on Wall Street. Shares climbed in most of Asia after President Donald Trump said he will delay the next U.S. tariff increase on China by about two weeks and following reports Beijing is considering American farm imports. Hong Kong equities dipped, weighed down by a slide in shares of the city’s exchange following a surprise takeover bid for its London counterpart. The offshore yuan climbed and the yen retreated.
The euro was little changed and European bonds nudged higher ahead of the ECB meeting, where policy makers are expected to lower the deposit rate and commence a new round of monetary stimulus.
The moves by China and the U.S. to ease tensions ahead of face-to-face talks in Washington in the coming weeks is helping support sentiment as investors await key central bank decisions. Trump said he was moving back a 5% increase in tariffs on a swathe of Chinese imports by two weeks, while Beijing may allow companies to resume purchases of U.S. agricultural products, according to people familiar with the situation.
“The quantum and nature of the changes mean they are more symbolic than substantial, but were still well received by investors,” said Michael McCarthy, chief market strategist at CMC Markets Plc in Sydney.
In addition to Thursday’s ECB gathering, the Federal Reserve is meeting next week, with some traders paring expectations of accommodation and August’s bullish bond sentiment fading.

275,By Investing.com,"<span>Sep 12, 2019 06:20AM ET</span>",StockBeat: European Stocks Taper Gains on Trade Hopes Ahead of ECB,"By Geoffrey Smith
Investing.com – Europe’s stock markets were mixed after early trading on Thursday, losing some initial momentum from President Donald Trump’s goodwill gesture to China on trade.
Markets had opened higher on relief at Trump's two-week deferral of a planned 5 percentage-point increase in tariffs on imports from China that was due to take place on Oct. 1. That should avoid any further escalation of the trade conflict ahead of the planned resumption of trade talks in early October.
But gains were capped by the prospect of the European Central Bank’s policy meeting, where the risks are arguably weighted to the downside, given how much expectation has been built into the outcome.
The biggest open questions from the ECB meeting are whether the bank will restart its bond purchase program (around 80% of analysts polled by Bloomberg say it will), and how effectively it can protect eurozone banks from the negative effects of even lower interest rates (analysts expect a cut of as much as 20 basis points in the deposit rate, which is currently at a record low of -0.4%).
By 5 AM ET, the benchmark STOXX 600 index was down 0.1% at 389.48. The defensively-oriented Swiss and Danish markets fared worst, losing 0.4% and 0.3% respectively, while Germany’s DAX and the U.K. FTSE 100 both benefited as cyclical stocks returned to favor after a battering in August.
The DAX was up 0.1%, with carmakers and their suppliers such as coatings company Covestro (DE:1COV) leading the way. In the U.K., mining stocks were among the biggest gainers, with  Anglo American  (LON:AAL) rising 2.1% and BHP Group PLC (LON:BHPB) 1.5%.
Anheuser Busch Inbev (BR:ABI), the world’s largest brewer, was also a prominent gainer, rising 3.1% on the back of a report that it is set to revive plans to spin off its Asian brewing operations to reduce debt.
 British American Tobacco  (LON:BATS) was also up 2.3% after announcing 2,300 job cuts – 4% of its global workforce and 20% of its senior staff – to generate savings that could be reinvested in alternative tobacco products.
The CAC 40 suffered as hotel group   Accor   (PA:ACCP) lost 3.2% in response to a downgrade from JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), while train-maker   Alstom   (PA:ALSO) fell 5.2% as its largest shareholder   Bouygues   unloaded around half of its stake via an accelerated bookbuilding process. Bouygues PA:BOUY) stock rose 0.3% to its highest in nearly a year."
276,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 12, 2019 06:01AM ET</span>","Charles Li, Hong Kong's charismatic exchange chief, leads charge for LSE","By Alun John
HONG KONG (Reuters) - When Hong Kong Exchange chief executive Charles Li described his company's surprise offer for the London Stock Exchange this week as a ""a corporate tale of Romeo and Juliet,"" listeners outside Asia may have been surprised by the colorful analogy.
But in Hong Kong, Li's fondness for extended metaphors are well known and have made the charismatic former offshore oil worker, lawyer, journalist and investment banker a popular figure at public events.
Li has run Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing (HK:0388) since 2010. Under his supervision, the exchange presents itself as a gateway between China and the rest of the world, and has benefited from a wave of IPOs as giant Chinese companies raised billions from international investors.
The exchange has been the world's largest capital-raising venue in five of the past 10 years – an honor it split with the New York Stock Exchange. Li also oversaw the creation of ""stock connect,"" in 2014, a mechanism for Chinese investors to trade Hong Kong-listed shares and international investors to trade shares listed in Shanghai and Shenzhen. It is now the main channel into China for investors overseas.
A Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing representative declined to comment for this article.
DEALMAKER
Market participants say Li's previous roles inform his approach to running the exchange. ""He is more of an investment banker than a traditional CEO of an exchange. Since taking over, he has been pursuing this bolt-on as well as transformational acquisitions approach,"" said a financial M&A banker in Hong Kong, who was not authorized to speak to the media. Recently, HKEX has focused on buying small fintech players to boost technology and data capabilities.
But Wednesday's shock announcement recalls HKEX's 2012 purchase of the London Metal Exchange (LME), which ran into trouble when HKEX raised trading fees. After an angry response from traders, a change of course, and LME leadership, steadied the ship. LME traders now generally speak well of Li. ""He is a big personality, a great front man; he likes getting on the stage and being bombastic and loud and the center of attention,"" said the London-based head of one metals brokerage, who also declined to be identified because he was not authorized to speak to the media. ""This latest move is hugely ambitious, but if anybody can pull it off, it's Charles."" JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) bankers say that when he was chairman of JPMorgan China between 2003 and 2009, he was known for his willingness to trust colleagues.
One said he often explained his attitude with a Chinese proverb: ""If you use a man, don't suspect him. If you suspect him, don't use him.""
NAVIGATING HONG KONG Beijing born-Li, despite speaking little Cantonese, has managed to balance the competing demands of global investment banks, the Hong Kong government, which approves six of HKEX's 13 board members, and Beijing, whose goodwill is crucial for its gateway role. After a multi-year campaign, Li in 2018 won approval to allow companies to list in Hong Kong with different classes of shares - a more relaxed standard of governance. Before the change, many Chinese tech companies chose a New York listing, including e-commerce giant  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA), whose 2014 $25 billion IPO is still a global record.
Li has not won over all groups in Hong Kong, though, notably the city's army of small brokers, who have their own representative in the 70-seat Legislative Council.
""I think Charles Li is capable when it comes to developing and promoting HKEX internationally. But he doesn't take care of small and medium brokers. This takeover is only one example,"" said Christopher Cheung, a stockbroker and Hong Kong lawmaker, who said adapting to LSE systems would be a financial burden.
More important for the success of LSE takeover is whether Li can adapt to the requirements of London-based traders, as he did eventually at the LME.
A senior China banker, who has played football with Li, an avid fan of the game, said the exchange chief was well equipped to pull off the LSE bid.
""[Li's] sharp and direct views, exactly like his strength on the football field as a striker, can always bring success to the team, the region and its businesses,"" the banker said."
277,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 12, 2019 05:40AM ET</span>",Aramco May Shun Direct IPO Sales to U.S. Funds on Legal Risk,"(Bloomberg) -- Saudi Aramco is considering a structure for its initial public offering that would prevent it from marketing the deal directly to fund managers in the U.S., people with knowledge of the matter said.
The state-owned oil giant wants to avoid litigation risks that could result from selling the deal to U.S.-based institutions, according to the people, who asked not to be identified because the information is private. Aramco is consulting with its bankers on the pros and cons of different deal structures, and it hasn’t made any final decision, the people said.
Many foreign IPOs rely on the “Rule 144A” structure, which allows overseas companies to market offerings to institutional investors in the U.S. The method being considered by Aramco is a so-called “Regulation S only” transaction, which would limit it to selling stock to foreign buyers and overseas units of U.S. fund houses, the people said.
While that means that Aramco could still market the IPO to big investors like BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK). and Fidelity Investments via their foreign affiliates, U.S. institutions without overseas subsidiaries would be left out. That would limit the pool of potential buyers for an offering that’s slated to be one of the biggest equity offerings in history.
Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman, the architect of the IPO plan, has previously said he expects Aramco to be valued at over $2 trillion.
Given those lofty expectations, Aramco will need all the help it can get to sell the deal. It has selected firms including Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) ,   Citigroup   Inc (NYSE:C), Credit Suisse (NYSE:CS), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and   Morgan Stanley   (NYSE:MS) for top roles on the transaction, people with knowledge of the matter said earlier this week.
Aramco is choosing as many as nine joint global coordinators including some Middle Eastern banks, according to the people. Saudi officials have also held discussions with some of the kingdom’s wealthiest families about becoming anchor investors in the offering, Bloomberg News has reported.
Aramco is planning to sell shares on the Saudi stock exchange as soon as November and plans plans to hold a kick-off meeting with underwriters as soon as this week, people with knowledge of the matter have said. The company, formally known as Saudi Arabian Oil Co., didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.
Other Saudi companies have started taking steps to rope in U.S. investors after the country began allowing foreign fund managers direct access to one of the world’s most restricted major stock exchanges. Earlier this year, mall operator Arabian Centres Co. conducted the first IPO by a Saudi company under Rule 144A, raising $659 million, data compiled by Bloomberg show."
278,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 12, 2019 05:04AM ET</span>","Concrete steps? For China cement giants, monster carbon footprint smothers climate goals","By David Stanway
WUHU, China (Reuters) - At its massive Baimashan plant near the Yangtze river in eastern China, cement giant  Anhui Conch  (SS:600585) has invested the best part of $10 million in new equipment to capture and store climate-warming greenhouse gas produced by its kilns.
The pilot carbon capture and storage (CCS) project, installed last year in the city of Wuhu in Anhui province, separates and purifies 50,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2) a year, which Conch will sell to industrial consumers. It's a textbook example of the kind of high-tech scheme Beijing says can help it meet lofty goals to cut pollution.
But the genius of the plan is overwhelmed by the scale of the problem it seeks to address: The volume captured is a small fraction of the 1.5 million tonnes of CO2 generated annually by just one production line, and Conch is still trying to figure out how to make the technology more affordable amid scant signs of demand for the carbon.
""This is part of our social responsibility and if we only considered the economics we wouldn't have done it,"" said Jin Feng, who runs the Baimashan plant for Conch, a powerhouse worth about $32 billion by market value. ""The local market (for CO2) is limited so we have no plans to expand,"" he told Reuters, speaking during a recent tour of the facility. 
China, in the middle of a long building boom, is by far the world's biggest consumer of cement, with total production capacity at around 55% of the global total. The sector's environmental footprint is enormous, producing vast quantities of nitrogen oxides and sulfur dioxide as well as CO2.
The global cement industry is responsible for around 7% of the world's greenhouse gas, according to industry estimates, both from the production of clinker - used to make cement - from limestone and from the use of fossil fuels. Six of the world's 10 biggest cement producers are in China. 
CCS is just one option when it comes to cutting emissions, said Cui Xingtai, vice-president at China's biggest cement producer by volume, the China National Building Materials Co. Ltd. (CNBM) (HK:3323).
""Conch has taken the lead in carbon capture and it is loss-making for them ... but we hope the entire industry can follow,"" he told Reuters, speaking on the sidelines of an industry conference.
""We are preparing to deploy this equipment. We also need to consider how to earn money from it."" 
ALTERNATIVE FUELS 
With carbon capture still out of reach for the vast majority of China's roughly 3,400 cement firms, the government has so far focused on enforcing stricter emission standards, improving energy efficiency and replacing polluting capacity with more advanced plants. 
The government is also trying to persuade producers to make use of alternative fuels, including municipal solid waste, tires or methane from landfills. Producers elsewhere have successfully raised alternative fuel ratios to around 20-30% - with Germany now as high as 68% - but according to an estimate by Huaxin Cement, China's fifth-largest producer, the domestic ratio is about 3%. 
Conch, which invested 60 million yuan ($8.47 million) in the Baimashan plant's CCS equipment, has converted 11 cement projects to municipal waste, with one 14 million tonnes per year plant in Tongling now incinerating all the trash produced by the city's residents.
But overall progress has been slow: Conch has a total of more than 150 regional subsidiaries and a total production capacity of more than 200 million tonnes, around a 10th of China's total.
While carbon capture could eventually play a bigger role in the sector, replacing fuel with trash could be the best short-term option to boost the cement makers' green credentials. 
""The Chinese government sees the cement industry as having a role to play in disposing of municipal solid waste, and eliminating landfill,"" said Ian Riley, chief executive of the World Cement Association, speaking to Reuters during the visit to the Conch CCS facility. ""China creates 300 million tonnes a year (of municipal solid waste) and the cement industry could handle all of that."" 
Chinese cement industry standards for sulfur dioxide and other pollutants are now tougher than Europe, according to CNBM's Cui, raising production costs by 70% in some regions. But alternative raw materials and energy sources are still needed, he said.

""It is very difficult, but the industry is working hard,"" he said.

279,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 12, 2019 04:26AM ET</span>",Mexico's $5 billion debt bailout for Pemex 'a one off': deputy minister,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico's $5 billion rescue package to pay down debt at Pemex [PEMX.UL] is a one-of-a-kind transaction that should give the struggling state oil company breathing space to focus on output and costs, Deputy Finance Minister Gabriel Yorio said.
Yorio told Reuters in an interview on Wednesday that the transaction, which also includes a debt refinancing plan, would be the last support the government gives to the world's most indebted oil company this year.
The step, announced earlier on Wednesday, was the latest by President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador to plot a brighter future for the cash-strapped, debt-laden oil and gas producer after years of declining output.
Saddled with more than $104 billion of financial debt, Pemex suffered a downgrade to speculative grade, or ""junk"", earlier this year by ratings agency Fitch. Moody's warns it too could strip Mexico's largest company of its investment grade rating.
Yorio said a second such downgrade risked contaminating Mexico's sovereign debt profile, which is rated by Fitch as BBB and that Moody's has on negative outlook.
To stave off a possible Pemex downgrade, the Mexican government has given Pemex several tax breaks and cash support this year, and has budgeted for another $4.4 billion of similar support in 2020. The government is expected to continue providing extra cash to the company for several more years.
The package including the $5 billion for prepayment of bonds that mature between 2020 and 2023 was a one-off, however, Yorio said.
""A transaction like this is only this time. We don't plan to do it every year, nor are we planning capitalizations like this every year,"" he said.
""This is the last piece of support that we are planning to give to Pemex from the point of view of the 2019 fiscal year.""
Pemex did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The company said in its announcement of the package on Wednesday that it will issue new bonds in maturities of seven, 10 and 30 years to refinance short-term debt, although it did not give a value for the new bond placements.
Yorio also declined to give the scale of the refinancing Pemex was targeting, beyond saying it should be larger than a similar program launched by Brazil this week.
In June, Pemex's chief financial officer said it was aiming to refinance $2.5 billion in maturing debt during 2019.
""We think is will be a transaction with enough volume that we can eliminate the company's credit risk in the short term,"" Yorio said.
With the level of relief provided to Pemex this year by the government, it was now the turn of the company to make improvements to head off further ratings actions, Yorio said.
""We think that by controlling the part of the finances, it permits (Pemex) to concentrate more on production,"" he said, adding that he wanted to see Pemex meet a target of producing 1.8 million barrels of oil per day in December, up from around 1.65 million currently.
""More than the government, they have to turn round the financial and production indicators,"" he said. ""They have to work now on cost efficiencies."""
280,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 12, 2019 04:22AM ET</span>","Amid U.S. vaping crackdown, Juul enters China with online store openings","SHANGHAI (Reuters) - U.S. e-cigarettes maker Juul Labs Inc, which faces a widening crackdown on vaping at home, has entered China, with online storefronts on e-commerce sites owned by  Alibaba  Group (N:BABA) and JD.com (O:JD) to tap the world’s largest market of smokers.
Juul, in which tobacco giant  Altria Group  (N:MO) owns a 35% stake, has been launching its products in international markets such as South Korea, Indonesia and Philippines. It recently raised over $750 million in an expanded funding round. 
The U.S. government announced plans on Wednesday to remove all flavored e-cigarettes from store shelves, as officials warned that sweet flavors had drawn millions of children into nicotine addiction. 
The move comes as U.S. health officials are investigating a handful of deaths and potentially hundreds of lung illnesses tied to vaping.
A notice published on Juul's official virtual store on Tmall, an Alibaba e-commerce site, said it had opened on Sept. 9. Juul also had a similar store on JD.com, another major Chinese online retailer.
On Tmall, a Juul device with two flavor pods sells for 299 yuan (about $40). Flavors include mint, mango and strawberry.
Juul, Tmall and JD.com did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Thursday. 
China, which is the world's largest single market for tobacco consumption with over 300 million smokers, represents a market with both opportunity and risk for the company.
It is already home to dozens of Chinese competitors with names such as Relx, Yooz, and SNOW+ that have taken tens of millions of dollars in venture capital funding from high-profile investors. Like Juul, the competitors have adopted the concept of producing discrete devices that vaporize potent nicotine salts.
China's government has perennially launched anti-smoking campaigns in an effort to improve public health. Earlier this year it released a draft document suggesting that China’s laws regulating e-cigarettes will eventually largely resemble those in Europe.

China’s tobacco industry, meanwhile, is tightly controlled by the government-run monopoly China Tobacco, which maintains complete oversight on the sale, production and distribution of tobacco products. Beijing relies on tobacco sales for a sizeable percentage of China’s overall tax revenue.

281,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 12, 2019 03:56AM ET</span>","Nissan China head, turnaround executive among top candidates for CEO: sources","By Norihiko Shirouzu, Laurence Frost and Gilles Guillaume
SEATTLE/PARIS (Reuters) - The head of Nissan Motor Co's (T:7201) China business and an executive tasked with leading its revival have emerged as two of the top candidates to take over as the next CEO of the troubled Japanese automaker, four people familiar with the matter said.
Discussions are still underway and nothing has been decided, said the people, all of whom spoke on condition of anonymity. There is also a possibility that another candidate could still be successful, with temporary Chief Executive Yasuhiro Yamauchi seen as one possibility, according to two sources.
The appointment of Nissan's next CEO in October will have vast implications for both the future of Japan's second-largest automaker and its strained alliance with top shareholder  Renault  SA (PA:RENA). The next leader could push for deeper ties with Renault or greater independence from it.
Two of the top candidates are Makoto Uchida, in charge of Nissan's operations in China, its biggest market, and Jun Seki, who previously headed the China business and is now spearheading an internal team charged with Nissan's recovery.
Uchida, who has worked on purchasing for the alliance, is seen as being favored by Renault and Renault-friendly members of Nissan's board, while Seki is preferred by those from the Nissan side, two of the people familiar with the matter said.
""Renault is much more familiar with Uchida,"" one of the people, a Nissan insider, said. ""The Renault side thinks Uchida is much easier to control than Seki.""
Nissan did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Other board members are throwing their weight behind Seki, partially due to politics but also because he is seen as having more well rounded experience as an auto executive, the two said.
""Seki is much more personable and well liked within Nissan and trusted by his peers and those under him,"" the Nissan insider said.
SHORT LEAD TIME
The nominations committee, which includes board members, is considering the candidates from a list of around 10, according to another person familiar with the deliberations. The board will ultimately vote on the next CEO.
""Given the short lead time, the next CEO most likely wouldn't be someone too far from the existing power structure,"" said Andre Lindeque, representative director of Turnpoint Consulting, an automotive recruiting agency in Tokyo.
""The focus on improved corporate governance may allow them the leeway to elevate someone who does not pose too much disruption to the leadership team.""
Nissan said this week that Chief Executive Hiroto Saikawa will resign on Sept. 16, bowing to pressure after he admitted to being improperly overpaid by around $440,000. It marks more upheaval at a company battered by a plunge in profit and the dramatic arrest of former chairman Carlos Ghosn last year.
Yamauchi will take over as temporary chief executive and the nominations committee has said it wants a permanent replacement appointed by the end of October.
Yamauchi is also seen as possible candidate especially if the board wants to stress continuity, two sources said.
Nissan managers favor Yamauchi, one of the people said.
Yamauchi, 63, is widely seen as a bridge between the alliance partners, and the near four-decade Nissan veteran is known to be well-regarded at Renault where he serves as a board member."

284,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 12, 2019 02:26AM ET</span>",Bears ease grip on most Asian currencies as trade worries ebb: Reuters poll,"By Rashmi Ashok
(Reuters) - Investors rolled back short positions on most Asian currencies over the past two weeks, a Reuters poll showed, as risk appetite picked up after the United States and China agreed to restart trade talks.
News that the world's two largest economies would return to the negotiation table in early October was cheered by markets, with bearish bets on the Chinese yuan being sharply unwound.
Reduced prospects of a no-deal Brexit and a possible breakthrough in Hong Kong's political standoff also helped investors raise views on Asian units and reduce safe-haven holdings.
The poll was closed on Wednesday, before a surprise announcement from U.S. President Donald Trump delaying scheduled tariff hikes on billions of dollars worth of Chinese goods.
Short positions in currencies of export-focused economies were also shaved, with sentiment toward the Korean won , the Taiwan dollar and the Singapore dollar improving the most, the poll of 15 respondents showed.
This spot of relief comes as worries over cooling demand from the region's largest trading partner, China, has begun to ease.
Meanwhile, bulls seized hold of the Indonesian rupiah for the first time since early August, the poll found.
A series of rate hikes last year has led to high real interest rates in the country, which helped to keep inflation in check and smoothed over currency volatility, attracting a large number of carry plays.
""The central bank has done a good job in terms of stabilizing the rupiah,"" said Sim Moh Siong, a FX strategist at Bank of Singapore.
""There is some silver lining in terms of the U.S.-China trade talks, and given that inflation is low and the Fed is cutting rates, the rupiah is now reaping the dividend from the central bank's efforts to stabilize it in the past.""
Bullish positions on the Thai baht retreated to their lowest since early June amid rising bets of a rate cut as early as September, after inflation missed expectations in August and stayed below the central bank's target for a third straight month.
Short positions on the Indian rupee largely remained unchanged, the poll found, after recent data showed sluggish economic growth between April and June and the manufacturing sector sputtered in August.
The data prompted a selloff in the equity market and brought expectations of a rate cut in October back to the table.
The Asian currency positioning poll is focused on what analysts and fund managers believe are the current market positions in nine Asian emerging market currencies: the Chinese yuan, South Korean won, Singapore dollar, Indonesian rupiah, Taiwan dollar, Indian rupee, Philippine peso, Malaysian ringgit and the Thai baht."
285,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 12, 2019 01:23AM ET</span>","Foxconn's Gou quits Taiwan's KMT, paving way for presidential bid","TAIPEI (Reuters) - Terry Gou, the founder of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) supplier Foxconn, quit Taiwan's main opposition party on Thursday, paving the way for a possible bid to stand in a presidential election as an independent, complicating President Tsai Ing-wen's prospects.
Gou, Taiwan's richest person with a net worth of $7.6 billion according to Forbes, has extensive business interests in China and is in known for his close ties with Beijing leaders.
He is also known for asserting that self-ruled Taiwan is part of ""one China"", a cherished principle for China, while acknowledging Taipei and Beijing have their own interpretations of what that means.
He has also repeatedly called for closer ties with Beijing, which would likely welcome his bid to challenge Tsai, who Beijing views as untrustworthy. Tsai is hoping to win a second term in next year's election.
Gou announced his intention to contest the presidential election in April as the candidate for the China-friendly opposition Kuomintang (KMT). But he lost his bid to win the party's nomination in July.
That raised speculation he would enter the presidential race as an independent but Gou's aide, Tsai Chin-yu, told reporters in Taipei his decision to resign as a member of the KMT was not linked to a decision on whether to run for president.
She cited disappointment with the leadership of a party which she said had become ""outdated"".
""Effective today, Mr Terry Gou quits the Kuomintang,"" the aide said.
The KMT said it ""deeply regretted"" Gou's decision and urged unity within the party to win the election.
Two people familiar with Gou's thinking said the 68-year-old billionaire was set to announce his bid to become president as an independent candidate by a Sept. 17 deadline for nominations.
Gou would appeal to voters who are dissatisfied with Taiwan's economy and in favor of closer ties with Beijing, one of the sources said.
Relations with Beijing, which have cooled since Tsai became president in 2016, are bound to dominate Taiwan's election.
Beijing suspects Tsai of pushing for Taiwan's formal independence although she denies that.
Beijing considers democratic Taiwan a wayward province and has never renounced the use of force to take it over.
Analysts say Gou's links to China might put off some voters, especially those who are increasingly wary of Beijing's ambitions to absorb the island.
Gou stepped down as chief of Foxconn this year, handing over the running of the company to an operations committee. But he retained a seat on the board of the company, formally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd.
Shares of Foxconn rose 1.6% on Thursday, beating the benchmark index's 0.3% rise. They are down about 20% since Gou announced his presidential bid in mid- April.
Analysts say a bid by Gou to become president as an independent could split the KMT, whose presidential candidate, Han Kuo-yu, is struggling in opinion polls."

The proposed takeover approach is worth 31.6 billion pounds ($38.97 billion) and will consist of both cash and newly issued HKEX shares. The figure represents a 22.9% premium on the LSE’s closing price on Tuesday.
Under the terms of the offer, LSE shareholders would receive 20.45 pounds in cash and 2.495 newly issued HKEX shares.
Hong Kong Exchange and Clearing Ltd (HK:0388)’s share prices fell 3.5% to HK$237.20 by 12:30 AM ET (04:30 GMT) on Thursday following the news.
Citing David Blennerhassett, an independent analyst writing on the SmartKarma research platform, Reuters said Hong Kong’s status as part of China could make it difficult to win approval for the deal from British politicians and regulators.
“It will be politically tough now and in the near-term to get this through various regulatory channels,” he said.
The Financial Times echoed Blennerhassett’s comments, adding that the bid is poised to be rejected amid doubts about political risk and deal structure.
Protests against a highly controversial extradition bill began in June and have crippled Hong Kong’s stock market and its economy. The now-withdrawn bill allows criminal suspects to be transferred to mainland China for trials. While the protests started as peaceful marches on the streets, the unrest became increasingly violent escalated into anti-government movements that saw protestors occupying the airport and disrupting its services, tear gas fired by police forces and hundreds of citizens arrested."

In a memo to staff on Wednesday evening, new Chief Executive Augustus Tang said he had asked executives to examine spending and focus on cutting costs. The airline will also not replace departing employees in non-flying positions unless approved by a spending control committee, he said.
Cathay has said it will cut capacity for the upcoming winter season after reporting an 11.3% fall in passenger numbers for August. The airline does not expect September to be any less difficult, while analysts have projected it could swing to a loss in the second half.
Cathay shares fell 2.4% early on Thursday, lagging the benchmark Hang Seng Index (HSI) that was down 0.4%.
The weak demand and cuts to capacity will heap more pressure on Cathay and its new management, appointed after CEO Rupert Hogg quit last month in a shock move and the resignation of Chairman John Slosar last week.
Cathay, which is trying to complete a three-year financial turnaround plan, has become the biggest corporate casualty of the Hong Kong protests after China demanded it suspend staff involved in, or supporting, the demonstrations that have plunged the former British colony into a political crisis.
Jefferies analyst Andrew Lee told clients he expected the airline could swing to a HK$973 million ($124.1 million) loss in the second half of the year. BOCOM International analyst Luya You said second-half earnings could be ""notably dismal"".

Cathay last month swung to its first profit for the January-June period since 2016 and said at the time that the second half was likely to be better as usual due to seasonality.

S&P 500 Index futures expiring in December advanced as much as 0.6% by 8:31 a.m. in Tokyo.

Investors in China’s financial markets are betting the next two weeks will be a breeze.
That’s down to expectations the government won’t allow anything to overshadow its National Day on Oct. 1, when China is set to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the People’s Republic. History is on their side: in the month running up to the big anniversaries since 2004, the Shanghai Composite Index has added more than 4%. The yuan was stable in those periods.
Beijing, which tends to lend support to markets around significant dates or events, has already been showering traders with gifts in recent weeks. Policy makers have lifted barriers on foreign investment, cut banks’ required reserve ratio and set the yuan’s daily rate at a stronger-than-expected level for 16 days. The moves have helped stabilize the currency and make Chinese shares the world’s top performers.
“Authorities will definitely try to maintain order, and the bottom line is we’re unlikely to see any big declines,” said Hao Hong, chief strategist at Bocom International Holdings Co.
President Donald Trump on Wednesday said he was postponing the imposition of additional tariffs on Chinese goods by 14 days as a goodwill gesture for the anniversary. The offshore yuan rose 0.3% to the strongest in nearly three weeks.
 Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). said in a note earlier this month that China’s national team, as state-backed funds are called, may have been “proactive” in the stock market since August. That would explain why a measure of volatility on the Shanghai Composite has fallen to the lowest since February last year.
The Shanghai Composite is up more than 8% over the past month. China’s markets will be closed Friday for a separate holiday.
“This year’s anniversary seems to carry particularly strong political importance to Chinese policy makers,” strategists including Kinger Lau wrote, citing Beijing’s desire to show it can meet its long-term goals despite the challenges it faces.
Escalating tensions between the U.S. and China have taken a toll on the country’s economy, with recent data showing exports fell 1% in dollar terms from a year earlier last month. The trade dispute is the main reason the Shanghai measure tumbled as much as 15% this summer and the yuan weakened past the 7 per dollar level for the first time in more than a decade.
Still, policy tweaks from the government and expectations the national team will ride to the rescue if necessary have helped the benchmark equity gauge close above the key 3,000 level for the first time since July.
“I’ve raised my stock position to over 90% and expect to maintain the high level until at least mid-October,” said Bruce Yu, a fund manager with Franklin Templeton SinoAm Securities Investment Management Inc. “It’s an important anniversary this year and China is facing challenges both internally and globally, so the market is expected to do well.”

NEW YORK (Reuters) - OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma LP reached a tentative agreement with some plaintiffs to resolve litigation over its alleged role in fueling the U.S. opioid crisis and plans to tussle with states opposing the settlement offer in bankruptcy proceedings as soon as next week, people familiar with the matter said.
On Wednesday, lead lawyers representing more than 2,000 cities, counties and other plaintiffs suing Purdue, along with 23 states and three U.S. territories, were on board with an offer from the company and its controlling Sackler family to settle lawsuits in a deal valued at up to $12 billion, the people said. 
More than a dozen other states remain opposed or uncommitted to the deal, setting the stage for a legal battle over Purdue's efforts to contain the litigation in bankruptcy court, they said.
States on Wednesday updated a federal judge on the settlement offer's support, which could evolve as the day progresses, the people said.
Purdue's board is scheduled to be briefed on settlement progress on Thursday, one of the people said. There remained a chance negotiations could fall apart and the company's plans, including timing of a bankruptcy filing, could change, the person said. 
Reuters earlier on Wednesday reported that Purdue was nearing a settlement with cities and many states. 
The Sacklers, well-known wealthy philanthropists, have declined to revise their proposed settlement contribution of $3 billion over seven years and another $1.5 billion or more through eventual sale of another business they own called Mundipharma, several people familiar with the matter said. 
New York, Massachusetts and Connecticut, where privately-held Purdue is based, are among states opposed to the current offer and have pushed the family to guarantee $4.5 billion, the people said.
Last weekend, the Sacklers ""refused to budge"" after attorneys general in North Carolina and Tennessee presented them with counterproposals they said had widespread support from other states, according to correspondence reviewed by Reuters. 
The lawsuits, some of which target the Sacklers as well as Purdue, claim the family and company contributed to a public health crisis that has claimed the lives of nearly 400,000 people between 1999 and 2017, according to the latest U.S. data.
The suits allege Purdue aggressively marketed prescription painkillers while misleading doctors and patients about their addiction and overdose risks. Purdue and the Sacklers have denied the allegations.
FAMILY CONTRIBUTION A STICKING POINT
With negotiations over the family's contribution to a settlement at loggerheads, Purdue is preparing to file for bankruptcy protection as soon as this weekend or next with the outlines of a settlement in hand, the people said. 
Purdue would then ask a U.S. bankruptcy judge to halt litigation while settlement discussions continue, a move some states said they are likely to challenge https://www.reuters.com/article/us-opioids-litigation-bankruptcy-focus/fate-of-opioid-litigation-hinges-on-government-police-power-idUSKCN1TR16C. A bankruptcy judge could force holdouts to accept a settlement as part of Purdue's reorganization plan if enough other plaintiffs agree. 
""Purdue Pharma continues to work with all plaintiffs on reaching a comprehensive resolution to its opioid litigation that will deliver billions of dollars and vital opioid overdose rescue medicines to communities across the country impacted by the opioid crisis,"" the company said in a statement.
Members of the Sackler family targeted in lawsuits said in a statement that they support ""working toward a global resolution that directs resources to the patients, families and communities across the country who are suffering and need assistance"" as opposed to engaging in what they described as ""endless litigation.""
With Purdue facing more than 2,000 opioid-related lawsuits, Reuters reported in March that the company and the Sacklers began exploring bankruptcy options to halt litigation and attempt to come to a far-reaching settlement. 
One reason Purdue is eyeing a bankruptcy filing soon is to avoid an Oct. 21 trial, the people said. That trial, stemming from widespread lawsuits consolidated in an Ohio federal court, risks a verdict with outsize damages Purdue could not withstand, one of the people said. 
Lead lawyers for the cities and counties suing Purdue in the Ohio proceedings said they recommended the plaintiffs continue negotiating a final settlement based on parameters of the current proposal. 
The Tennessee attorney's general's office said it had agreed to the offer's framework, calling it ""the most significant step to date in a multi-year investigation and negotiation to obtain meaningful relief to address the opioid addiction crisis."" 
Purdue's current proposal would use bankruptcy proceedings to transform into a public trust with a board selected by court-appointed trustees, the people said. The trust would donate drugs the company developed to combat opioid abuse to U.S. communities, which Purdue values at $4.45 billion over 10 years. 
The Sacklers, who amassed a multibillion-dollar fortune from OxyContin sales, would cede control of Purdue, they said.
A Chapter 11 filing with a deal many states oppose risks triggering more litigation and longer, more expensive bankruptcy proceedings that could reduce payouts to plaintiffs unless a broader deal is reached. 
""I remain steadfast in my view that the Sacklers have to give back the money they took from selling opioids so that we can put it toward solving the problem they created,"" Connecticut Attorney General William Tong said in a statement. ""The current proposal does not do that."" 
The Sacklers have rebuffed requests from some plaintiffs for more details on the family's finances, some of the people said. 
North Carolina Attorney General Josh Stein said he was preparing to follow other state officials and sue the Sacklers.

“A large number of states are committed to the notion that the Sacklers need to guarantee more money,"" he said.

The U.S. conglomerate, which will lose majority control of Baker Hughes, said it would raise the amount through a public offering of 115 million Baker Hughes Class A shares priced at $21.50 each, and through a private sale of $250 million Class B Baker Hughes shares to the oilfield services provider.
""Combined net proceeds of the offering and the repurchase will be approximately $2.7 billion, or approximately $3.0 billion assuming full exercise of the underwriters' option to purchase additional shares in the offering,"" GE said in a statement.
General Electric said it expects to continue divesting the remainder of its holding in Baker Hughes over time.
In a separate statement, Baker Hughes said it expects the public offering of its Class A shares to close on Sept. 16, and that underwriters will have 30 days to purchase up to an additional 17.25 million shares from the selling stockholders.
GE's representation on Baker Hughes' board will be reduced from five members to one, with John Rice expected to stay on the board, the companies said.
GE had long planned to sell down its stake in Baker Hughes.

But the issue came under scrutiny last month when Madoff whistleblower Harry Markopolos issued a lengthy report that alleged in part that GE was improperly counting Baker Hughes' income, capital and cash in GE's financial statements. GE has maintained its accounting was appropriate.

(Reuters) - U.S. private equity firm Blackstone (NYSE:BX) Group Inc said on Wednesday it has raised the largest ever real estate fund, amassing $20.5 billion to be invested in property assets around the world.
Large buyout firms such as Blackstone have been attracting a lot of capital from investors seeking higher returns not available in public markets.
The capital ready to be deployed has swollen to over $2 trillion, according to data provider Prequin, driving up asset prices and deal making activity.
Blackstone said in a statement the fund, named Blackstone Real Estate Partners IX (BREP IX), has already made its first investment: the purchase of U.S. industrial warehouse properties from Singapore-based logistics provider GLP for $18.7 billion.
The deal, in which BREP IX co-invested with other Blackstone funds, was announced in June and is expected to close in coming weeks, the company said.
Blackstone is the world's largest alternative asset manager and one of the biggest property investors, with $154 billion in real estate assets under management."

In an emailed response to Reuters, the motorcycle maker confirmed the layoffs but didn't share the details. Harley said it was reorganizing the division to manage its business with ""focus and discipline"".
The merchandise division accounted for about 5% of the company's revenues last year. However, sales have been falling since 2015. In the first half of this year, the unit reported a 4.2% year-on-year decline in revenues.
Harley is battling weak demand in the United States, which accounts for more than half of its sales. Declining sales have forced the company to revise down its motorcycle shipment forecast for the year.
The company official said the layoffs won't impact any workers in its manufacturing division."

299,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 11, 2019 06:36PM ET</span>","WeWork presses on with IPO, pushing SoftBank into a corner","By Anirban Sen and Joshua Franklin
(Reuters) - Office-sharing startup WeWork is pressing ahead with plans to go public despite lukewarm interest in its shares, three sources said, leaving its largest investor, SoftBank Group (T:9984), with a stark choice: take a haircut or pony up even more cash.
The We Company, WeWork's parent, may seek a valuation as low as $15 billion to $18 billion in an initial public offering, down from the $47 billion value it commanded in the last private fundraising round in January, one source familiar with the situation said.
That means SoftBank, which has invested $10.65 billion in WeWork since 2017 through its Saudi-backed $100 billion Vision Fund and other vehicles, would have to write down the value of its investment should the IPO go ahead.
Sources familiar with the situation cautioned that no final decisions have yet been made and the plans around valuation and timing of the IPO are all still subject to change.
The sources requested anonymity because the matter is private. SoftBank declined to comment. We Company also declined to comment.
The sharply lower valuation reflects concerns around the sustainability of We Company's business model, which relies on a mix of long-term liabilities and short-term revenue, and how such a model would weather an economic downturn, according to investors and analysts.
A sharp cut to WeWork's valuation would be a blow to SoftBank as at a time when it is seeking funds from investors for a second Vision Fund, for which it says $108 billion in pledges have been secured.
Returns for SoftBank first Vision Fund have already been hit by lackluster listings of Uber (N:UBER) and Slack (N:WORK).
SoftBank chief Masayoshi Son and longtime lieutenant and group Vice Chairman Ron Fisher were in favor of the WeWork IPO until last week, even as others inside the group were pushing for a delay, one of the sources said.
However, in recent days Son and Fisher have now conceded internally that a delay might be in SoftBank's best interests, the source added.
Son and SoftBank have been pushing We Company Chief Executive Adam Neumann to delay the IPO but have so far failed to persuade him, according to two sources familiar with the matter.
Having burned through $2.36 billion in cash in the first half of the year, WeWork requires a fresh injection of funds and is looking to raise between $3 billion and $4 billion in the IPO, Reuters has reported.
Adding to the importance of We Company going public is the $6 billion in bank commitments it secured in August, which is dependent on it raising at least $3 billion from the IPO.
Given its need for cash, a postponement of the IPO would be feasible if SoftBank would inject more cash into WeWork, a proposition Son has so far been reluctant to pursue given how much the fund has already put in, according to two sources.
For its part, WeWork may now wait until Monday of next week to begin its roadshow to pitch the IPO to investors given that it is still waiting on approval for its filing from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, according to one source familiar with the matter.
The company had previously hoped to be in a position to begin its IPO roadshow as early as this week, Reuters has reported.
Reflecting the uncertainty in its IPO plans, We Company's $669 billion junk bond issued last year fell below par on Tuesday for the first time since announcing its IPO plans about a month ago. The 7.875% note due in May 2025 was down 2.5 cents on the dollar and the yield surged by 55 basis points to the highest since mid-August.
INTUITIVE BETS
While SoftBank and its Vision Fund emphasize their long-term investing credentials, founder and CEO Son has set out an ambitious IPO pipeline for tech investments spanning ride-hailing, fintech and health startups.
The tech conglomerate has burned through much of the $100 billion raised by its first Vision Fund in just two years, recording big paper gains on internal revaluations of its tech investments as well as the sale of marquee investments including India's Amazon Inc (O:AMZN) rival Flipkart.
SoftBank says its valuation techniques include cash-flow analysis, recent transactions and comparison with peers to underpin its numbers, but Son has won a reputation for intuitive bets and for doubling down on companies which have yet to generate hard results.
SoftBank says many investments receive a vote of confidence as third parties come in as co-investors or by making follow-on investments at the same or higher valuations.
If a tech company shelves an IPO due to a lower valuation than expected, investors are generally expected to take that fall into account when appraising their stakes."

Babcock (L:BAB), BAE Systems (L:BAES) and Atlas Elektronik UK have all submitted designs for the frigate.
They will be built in Britain and the government will buy at least five, with the first set to be in the water by 2023.
""(The) UK is an outward-looking island nation, and we need a shipbuilding industry and Royal Navy that reflect the importance of the seas to our security and prosperity,"" Prime Minister Boris Johnson said in a statement.
""I am convinced that by working together we will see a renaissance in this industry which is so much part of our island story – so let's bring shipbuilding home.""
The program will support over 2,500 jobs across the UK, including its supply chain, with all the different parts of the frigates being assembled and built at British shipyards.
The government has committed to keeping up a fleet of at least 19 frigates and destroyers with the aiming of growing the fleet in the 2030s. The Type 31 program will replace Type 23 frigates.
Britain is building patrol vessels and new Type 26 frigates at BAE Systems' Govan shipyard on the Clyde river in Glasgow.
But the country's shipbuilding industry has suffered a catastrophic decline in the last 40 years, with shipyards in places from Sunderland to Portsmouth closing.
Belfast's Harland and Wolff shipyard, where the Titanic was built, went into administration last month."
301,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 11, 2019 05:37PM ET</span>","Hong Kong Exchange in $39 billion bid for LSE, rivaling Refinitiv deal","By Huw Jones and Sinead Cruise
LONDON (Reuters) - Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Ltd (HKEX) (HK:0388) made a $39 billion takeover approach to the  London Stock Exchange  Plc (L:LSE) on Wednesday, aiming to create a global trading powerhouse and thwart the latter's $27 billion acquisition of financial data provider Refinitiv.
With its bid, HKEX is betting that a major international acquisition will help it overcome uncertainty at home. Hong Kong's pro-democracy protests in the last few weeks over China's political influence have raised questions among major companies and investors about the appeal of the Hong Kong bourse.
HKEX is also seeking to capitalize on the weakness of the British pound, which has been hit by Britain's inability to settle on a deal to leave the European Union. The weaker pound has made British companies cheaper for foreign acquirers.
The proposed deal is aimed at creating a combined group better able to compete with U.S. rivals such as Intercontinental Exchange Inc (N:ICE) and CME Group inc (O:CME). It is contingent on LSE abandoning the deal it clinched last month to acquire Refinitiv.
""The board of HKEX believes a proposed combination with LSE represents a highly compelling strategic opportunity to create a global market infrastructure leader,"" the Hong Kong exchange said in a statement.
The LSE said it would review HKEX's proposal. In a sign of its cool reception to HKEX's bid, it added that it was committed to, and continued to, make good progress on its planned acquisition of Refinitiv from U.S. private equity firm Blackstone Group Inc (N:BX) and  Thomson Reuters Corp  (TO:TRI). Thomson Reuters is the parent of Reuters News.
Spokespeople for Refinitiv, Blackstone and Thomson Reuters declined to comment. 
Under the terms of the offer, LSE shareholders would receive 2,045 pence in cash and 2.495 newly issued HKEX shares. HKEX said it intended to apply for a secondary listing of its shares on the LSE once the deal has gone through. 
HKEX, whose main shareholder is the Hong Kong government, said its 31.6 billion pounds cash-and-share transaction proposal represented a 22.9% premium to the LSE's closing stock price on Tuesday of 8,361 pence. 
LSE shares ended trading on Wednesday only up 5.9% at 7,206 pence. The significant gap with HKEX's offer price reflects widespread scepticism that the bid will succeed, because of the regulatory hurdles and political resistance the deal is expected to face in Britain, investors said.
A key challenge: Securing the support of the British government, which has already signaled some wariness over handing control of its stock exchange to a foreign acquirer with close links to China. 
The UK Treasury described the LSE as a ""critically important part"" of the British financial system. ""As you would expect, the government and the regulators will be looking at the (proposed deal) details closely,"" a spokesman said.
""It looks uncertain whether shareholders will accept the offer, given that the Refinitiv deal is popular across the shareholder base for its potential to transform the business and add value over the long-term,"" said Guy de Blonay, a fund manager at Jupiter, a top-25 investor in the LSE. 
A Hong Kong company acquiring one of Britain's marquee financial institutions - which also owns the Milan exchange and is a major clearing house in the United States - would be a challenging feat for HKEX. 
Germany's Deutsche Boerse (DE:DB1Gn) has failed three times in recent years to acquire LSE, hitting opposition from politicians and regulators. 
It was also not immediately clear whether the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), a government panel that scrutinizes deals for potential national security concerns, would also have jurisdiction to review HKEX's bid for LSE, analysts said. 
A spokesman for the U.S. Department of the Treasury, which chairs CFIUS, did not respond to a request for comment on whether the deal would be subject to CFIUS review.
BLACKSTONE'S REFINITIV DEAL AT STAKE
Refinitiv’s deal with LSE came just 10 months after Blackstone bought a majority stake in the unit from Thomson Reuters in a $20 billion deal.
LSE has said it expects the Refinitiv acquisition to close in the second half of 2020. Were it to walk away, it would have to pay Refinitiv a 198.3 million pound break-up fee. 
Emboldened by the lukewarm reaction in LSE's stock, Blackstone stayed put on Wednesday, viewing HKEX's chances of success as remote, according to people familiar with the matter. 
Prices of bonds issued by Refinitiv were only slightly lower in secondary trading on Wednesday, suggesting investors did not view the deal with LSE at risk.

HKEX FALLS BEHIND
HKEX has been the world's largest listings venue in five of the past 10 years, going head-to-head against the New York Stock Exchange over that decade, according to Refinitiv data. 
But this year it has fallen behind, raising $10.8 billion to the NYSE's $20.2 billion, with activity suffering as the political turmoil deepened. Last month, Chinese e-commerce giant  Alibaba  Group Holding Ltd (N:BABA) delayed plans for a $15 billion offering in Hong Kong because of the unrest.
No other bid for LSE appeared forthcoming on Wednesday. Benjamin Jackson, president of New York Stock Exchange owner Intercontinental Exchange Inc, placed his company out of the running.
""The reasons are, you have Brexit uncertainty, you've got valuations, you've got deals have to meet our internal rate of return criteria that we put forth,"" he said at a  Barclays  (LON:BARC) financial services conference on Wednesday.
In an interview with Reuters on Wednesday, CME Chairman and CEO Terry Duffy also poured cold water on the idea of bid. ""I just closed on my European transaction with NEX in November, and I'm laser focused on the integration of that and growing our core business,"" Duffy said. 
LSE CEO David Schwimmer has said that big takeovers in exchanges are difficult due to political concerns. In recent years the LSE has sought to diversify away from basic trading and clearing to data and analytics.
The Asian exchange, however, said it was confident its proposal faced no major regulatory hurdles due to little overlap in markets.
HKEX said it has already begun discussions with certain regulators in Britain and Hong Kong. ""The board of HKEX believes that the two businesses are highly complementary and as such, looks forward to working with the relevant authorities to deliver a clear path to completion,"" it added.
Should the proposed takeover be successful, it is expected that key LSE management would continue to operate LSE businesses, HKEX said.
The Hong Kong government threw its support behind the move.
""The government is glad to see HKEX's endeavor to enhance its core strength and seek international expansion in accordance with its strategic plan,"" a spokesman said.

303,By Investing.com,"<span>Sep 11, 2019 05:10PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch,"Investing.com - Here are the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow.
1. Last Inflation Numbers Ahead of Fed
Market participants look ahead to the release of consumer inflation data due Thursday at 8:30 AM ET (12:30 GMT).
Economists forecast that overall inflation measured by the consumer price index (CPI) in August slowed to 0.1% from 0.3% the prior month, while the core CPI, which excludes volatile food and energy price, slowed to 0.2% from 0.3% a month earlier.
That would bring year-over-year CPI growth to an unchanged 1.8% and core CPI growth a notch higher at 2.3%.
The consumer inflation report is due a day after the core producer price index topped economists’ forecasts.
The slow pace of inflation was one of the underlying concerns highlighted in the Fed’s July meeting, when the central bank cut its benchmark rate. At its next meeting Sept. 17-18, the Fed is widely expected to cut rates again.
The weekly report on initial jobless claims is also due at 8:30 AM ET.
The forecast of economists polled by Investing.com is for a downtick to 215,000 from 217,000 the prior week.
2. OPEC and Allies Gather in Abu Dhabi 
OPEC and its allies meet on Thursday in Abu Dhabi to review the cartel's oil production strategy. 
The UAE’s Energy Minister recently vowed to get all members to commit to curbs, but said there is no recommendation to make deeper cuts despite concerns about oil-demand growth in the face of weakening global economic growth.
But the action from OPEC to boost prices looks limited, according to Goldman Sachs.
""With crude oil well below Saudi Arabia’s target of ($80 per barrel), we feel they have no choice but to continue the current production cut agreement to help support current prices,"" Goldman said in a recent note. ""The ability for OPEC to push prices higher looks limited.""
Crude oil pared some early-week gains over the past two days as traders fear the Trump administration may be looking to meet with Iran, with a view to a potential deal that could lessen sanctions on the Islamic Republic. That could lead to an uptick in global crude supply.
Asked if he would consider easing sanctions on Iran, Trump on Wednesday replied: “We’ll see what happens.”
Oil prices started the week on the front foot, buoyed by expectations that Saudi Arabia may adopt more aggressive cuts following the appointment of new oil minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman. The prince said, however, that there would not be a radical change in the country's oil policy.
Crude oil fell nearly 3% to $55.75 a barrel Wednesday in the U.S. Brent crude fell $1.57, or 2.5%, to $60.81 a barrel. Brent is the global benchmark crude.
3. It’s ECB Day! 
The European Central Bank is set to decide on monetary policy Thursday at 07:45 AM ET (11:45 GMT), with the central bank expected to reveal easing measures to tackle economic troubles brewing in the eurozone.
Expectations for aggressive monetary policy easing measures, however, have cooled in recent weeks. But ECB President Mario Draghi - in what will be his penultimate outing before Christine Lagarde takes the helm - is likely to unveil a fresh stimulus package after laying the groundwork at his last press conference.
With little improvement on the pace of eurozone economic growth and inflation and the option of a no-deal Brexit on the table, Draghi will have to follow up with some sort of action, Action Economics said in a recent note.
The ECB economy grew 0.2% in the second quarter and the region’s largest economies, Germany and France, saw a 0.1% decline and a 0.2% rise for the quarter respectively.
“Most are expecting a 10 bp cut in the deposit rate, which would leave it at -0.50%. The repo zrate, currently at 0.00%, is likely to be kept on hold for now,” Action Economics added."
304,By Investing.com,"<span>Sep 11, 2019 05:07PM ET</span>","Stocks – Market Surges on Apple, Tech and Boeing Gains","Investing.com - Stocks enjoyed a solid rally Wednesday as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and many chip stocks, along with Boeing (NYSE:BA), attracted investor interest.
The rally brought the major averages close to reaching new highs, a prospect that may be achieved if the Federal Reserve cuts interest rates at its meeting next week.
The S&P 500 was up 0.72% and ended with its first close above 3,000 since July 30. The Dow Jones industrials rose 0.85%.
The Nasdaq Composite jumped 1.06%. The Nasdaq 100 index added 0.93%.
It was the Dow's sixth-straight gain. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq had their best performances since Thursday.
The S&P 500 and Dow are just under 1% from their all-time highs set in July. The Nasdaq is still about 2% below its peak.
Apple, up 3.2%, rallied on the heels of a well-received product announcement session in California. The session introduced new iPhone models and pricing information on its Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) TV+ and Arcade game services. The gain added 47 points to the Dow's 228-point gain.
Perhaps as important, Apple's market capitalization hit $1.01 trillion, topping the trillion-dollar level for the first time since late 2018. The shares are up nearly 5% this week, 13% for the quarter and 41.8% on the year. Of course, Apple fell more than 30% in last fall's slump. 
Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), up slightly on the day, has a market cap of $1.04 trillion.
Boeing (NYSE:BA) jumped 3.6% despite continued uncertainty over when its 737 Max airliner will go back into service and worries about problems with its new 777X. The gain was responsible for about 91 points of the Dow's rise.
The rally also saw gains for such beaten-down stocks as   Alcoa   (NYSE:AA), Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), Macy’s (NYSE:M) and U.S. Steel (NYSE:X).
The demand for U.S. stocks helped push the U.S. dollar higher against major currencies. Crude oil  prices moved lower because a rising dollar makes oil more expensive for non-U.S. buyers.

Assets of money funds, which are seen as being nearly as safe as bank accounts, climbed by $24.57 billion to $3.355 trillion in the week ended Sept. 10, the Money Fund Report said.
This brought their year-to-date increase in fund assets to about $385 billion.
Money funds are offering investors higher yields than some Treasury maturities. That, however, would change if the Federal Reserve reduces borrowing costs further to counter deteriorating business activity and the trade conflict between the world's biggest economies.
The Fed cut interest rates for the first time since 2008 in July. The interest rates market signaled traders are prepared for another rate decrease at the Fed's upcoming meeting later in September.
Taxable money fund assets climbed by $24.12 billion to $3.220 trillion, while tax-free assets increased by $443.5 million to $135.07 billion, the report, published by iMoneyNet, showed.
The iMoneyNet average seven-day simple yield for taxable money funds dipped to 1.75% from 1.76% the previous week. The weighted average maturity among taxable funds was lengthened by one day to 32 days.
The iMoneyNet average seven-day yield for tax-free and municipal funds fell to 0.91% from 0.97%. The weighted average maturity of tax-free funds grew one day to 34 days."

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - The California State Senate voted on Tuesday to pass a bill that would make it much more difficult for gig economy companies like  Uber Technologies Inc  (N:UBER) and  Lyft  Inc (O:LYFT) to classify workers as independent contractors rather than employees.
The bill, which was sponsored by California Assemblywoman Lorena Gonzalez and is backed by Governor Gavin Newsom, passed the chamber with 29 votes in favor and 11 votes against it.
Called AB5, the law has garnered national attention, largely owing to the size of California's workforce. Several Democratic presidential candidates have supported the measure, including U.S. senators Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Kamala Harris of California.
""By approving AB5, the California legislature solidified our state's position as the national leader on workplace rights,"" the California Labor Federation said in a statement.
The bill has come under sharp criticism by trade groups and so-called ""gig economy"" technology firms that rely heavily on the state's 450,000 contract workers.
""We are fully prepared to take this issue to the voters of California to preserve the freedom and access drivers and riders want and need,"" Lyft said in a statement. 
The bill strikes at the heart of the ""gig economy"" business model of technology platforms like Uber, Lyft, DoorDash, PostMates and others who rely on hundreds of thousands of independent workers, not full-time employees, to drive passengers or deliver food via app-based services.
Backers of the bill, including labor groups, have argued that classifying these California workers as employees would be the fix to longstanding driver complaints about low pay and the lack of medical insurance and other benefits.
The consequences of the bill remain unclear in the short-term for both Uber and Lyft, who have argued that the legislation compromises the flexibility prized by their workforce, and that fewer workers would be hired were they considered employees.
Both companies are unprofitable and have historically relied on subsidization to attract riders.
In recent weeks, Uber, Lyft and DoorDash have pushed for separate legislation that would increase pay and benefits for drivers yet maintain their status as independent contractors. Company officials have said a compromise deal is still possible, even after the passage of AB5.
Uber and Lyft have both said they would support a minimum wage, while driving on a trip, of $21 per hour. 
The two ride-hailing companies and DoorDash earmarked $90 million for a planned November 2020 ballot initiative that would exempt them from the law. 
The bill next goes back to the Assembly for a final vote and then moves on to Governor Newsom for signature.
California is the nation's most populous state and a leader in establishing policies that are adopted by other states.
CALIFORNIA COURT CASE
The bill codifies a 2018 California Supreme Court decision, Dynamex Operations West Inc v. Superior Court, that set out a more stringent three-point test for determining whether workers are properly classified as independent contractors. 
The court said workers are a company's employees under state wage laws when the company exercises control over their work or they are integral to its business.
Uber Chief Legal Officer Tony West said little would change in the immediate aftermath of the law because the passage of the bill does not automatically reclassify drivers. 
Uber could ""meet the harder test to the satisfaction of arbitration and courts"" if needed, West said. 

Last week, the bill was amended to allow city attorneys to sue for injunctive relief if companies do not abide by AB5.

309,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 11, 2019 04:27PM ET</span>",Pemex Gets $5 Billion from Government to Boost Debt Profile,"(Bloomberg) -- Petroleos Mexicanos will use a new $5 billion capital injection from the Mexican government to improve the embattled state oil company’s debt profile by lengthening maturities.
Pemex, as the company is known, will use the funds to prepay bonds due from 2020 to 2023, issue new debt maturing in 7, 10 and 30 years and swap bonds to provide additional support, the company said in an e-mailed news release Wednesday. Mexico’s finance ministry had announced the capital injection in an earlier statement, confirming a Bloomberg News report on Tuesday.
The company, the most indebted major oil producer with more than $100 billion in liabilities, is working to bolster cash flow and boost production as it fights a possible downgrade to junk credit rating. Proceeds from the transaction will be used to cut Pemex’s debt, the company said in the statement. The yield on Pemex bonds maturing in 2027 dropped 19 basis points to 6.28% on Wednesday.
“Even if it’s a little small, this is the real capital injection that the market has been demanding for almost a year now,” said Roger Horn, a senior emerging-market strategist at SMBC Nikko Securities America in New York. “That and the liability management exercise should clear up near-term maturities and give the rating companies reasons not to downgrade.”
JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co.,  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS).,  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C). and Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC). are among the banks working on the transaction.
While the deal will help free up cash for Pemex in the short-term it isn’t enough to replace dwindling reserves and reverse long-term oil production declines, according to credit agencies. Pemex’s outlook remains negative because its capital expenditure still falls short of replacing reserves in 2019 and 2020, Moody’s said in a statement after the announcement.
The deal, which will include a swap for U.S.-denominated bonds maturing between 2022 and 2048, and the repayment of revolving credit facilities, represents moderate government support for Pemex, Fitch Ratings Inc. said in a release. The agency in June cut the oil producer’s bonds to junk, with Moody’s shifting its outlook to negative.
“Although Pemex has implemented some cost cutting measures and received moderate tax cuts from Mexico, the company continues to severely under-invest in its upstream business, which could lead to further production and reserves decline,” Fitch said. “The very high level of transfers from Pemex to the Mexican government continues to significantly pressure Pemex’s cash flow generation and reinvestment ability.”
Government support has been close to $10 billion so far this year -- including the $5 billion capital injection announced Tuesday, a previously announced $1.3 billion cash infusion, $1.5 billion in tax relief and $1.8 billion in pension notes payouts.
Nevertheless, its high tax burden -- equivalent to about 88% of its Ebitda in the first half of the year -- cancels out much of the benefits. And it requires about $20 billion a year to meet its investment requirements to raise oil production, BBVA (MC:BBVA) said last month.

  Citigroup   (NYSE:C) raised concerns about the downside to consensus estimates and the risk to Intel's second-half guidance given the potential for a slowdown in PC shipments as tariff-driven pull-ins fade.

Notebook units increased 5% month-over-month in August, which was below Intel's expectations by roughly 6%, according to a report by  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) Christopher Danely. The sales shortfall was blamed on the weaker shipments in the second quarter following a tough comparative from a year earlier, when vendors ramped up orders ahead of US-imposed tariffs on China.
As well as the inventory correction for microprocessors, competition from Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is also expected to muddy the outlook on fourth-quarter growth for Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), according to Citi.

314,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 11, 2019 02:22PM ET</span>",Special Report: Court let Merck hide secrets about baldness drug's risks,"By Dan Levine
PARK CITY, Utah (Reuters) - By the time Kelly Pfaff got home from driving her son to school that morning, it was too late.
Her husband, John, was supposed to be taking their 4-year-old daughter to school. But the girl and the nanny were still at the Pfaffs’ house near San Diego. So were John’s wallet, cellphone and wedding ring. John was gone.
Kelly was alarmed, but not surprised. For four years, she had watched her husband, once a successful information-technology executive, avid skier and doting father, spiral inexplicably into despair.
It had started with dark, sulking moods. Then he lost interest in sex. His wife asked him if he was having an affair. “No … Something’s just not right down there,” Kelly said her husband told her. Panic attacks set in.
He suspected the cause might have been Propecia, the popular Merck & Co drug he had been taking to treat hair loss since around the time his problems started. He quit the pills, but still he couldn’t sleep, and he flashed random anger at the children. He started talking about killing himself.
On the morning of March 5, 2013, about 45 minutes before his wife got home, John Pfaff stepped onto the railroad tracks a block away and into the path of a southbound Amtrak train. He was killed on impact.
Kelly Pfaff blames Merck for her husband’s death at age 40. In a lawsuit filed in 2015, she alleges that the pharmaceuticals company for years knew but concealed from the public that Propecia could cause the persistent sexual dysfunction and depression that led to her husband’s suicide about a year after he quit taking the drug.
John Pfaff wasn’t the only man who experienced sexual problems after taking Propecia. His widow’s lawsuit was one of more than 1,100 filed across the United States and consolidated in so-called multidistrict litigation (MDL) in federal court in Brooklyn, New York. They accuse Merck of not adequately warning patients of the drug’s possible side effects and their duration.
Merck has denied the allegations in court filings and declined to comment further on Pfaff’s case. In a statement to Reuters, Merck said it “stands behind the safety and efficacy of Propecia,” noting that the drug has been prescribed safely to millions of men since the late 1990s. While the drug’s label lists erectile dysfunction and other sexual problems as possible side effects among a small percentage of men, the company rejects allegations that Propecia causes those problems to persist after men stop taking it or that it can lead to mental health issues. Merck says the symptoms themselves could be caused by a variety of other factors.
However, confidential documents reviewed by Reuters accuse Merck of exaggerating the drug’s safety record.
Citing internal company communications, these legal briefs filed by plaintiffs’ lawyers allege that in revisions to the drug’s original 1997 label, Merck understated the number of men who experienced sexual symptoms in clinical trials, and how long those symptoms lasted. Other documents show that Merck knew roughly 20 years ago that sales of the drug would suffer if the public became aware of Propecia’s possible long- term effects on men’s sexual health.
A redacted section of one plaintiffs’ motion, reviewed by Reuters, cites correspondence from a Merck executive in which he objected to what he described as “misleading” information about the incidence of sexual dysfunction in men taking Propecia. That information was placed on the drug’s label despite his comments, the court document says, and it remains there today.
Merck said that Propecia’s label has always accurately reflected data from the company’s clinical trials and that it disclosed all data to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Merck also said the executive’s “misleading” comment was taken out of context in the court filing.
The documents reviewed by Reuters were filed under seal or heavily redacted by plaintiffs’ lawyers – not Pfaff’s – in federal court in Brooklyn. Merck had marked the documents confidential when sharing them with the plaintiffs’ lawyers, and those lawyers didn’t push to file them openly on the public docket. Judge Brian Cogan allowed the medical secrets contained in the documents to be kept out of public view. Reuters is able to report this confidential information now only after discovering filing errors that left some of it exposed.
Still under seal in Cogan’s court are the internal Merck documents on which plaintiffs’ lawyers based the allegations they made in the legal briefs Reuters reviewed.
Such court-sanctioned secrecy has become the lethal norm in product-liability litigation in the United States. As Reuters reported in June, judges in large product-liability cases routinely seal evidence relevant to public health and safety. As a result, hundreds of thousands of Americans have been killed or seriously injured by allegedly defective products — cars, drugs, guns, medical devices — while evidence that could have alerted consumers and regulators to potential danger remained under seal.
DANGEROUS CONVENIENCE
Court secrecy has become pervasive even though, as a matter of law, court records are presumed to be public. Though exceptions can be made when national security, individual privacy or company trade secrets are at stake, the principle of open justice is rooted in American law. In most U.S. jurisdictions, judges are supposed to weigh a litigant’s request for secrecy against the broader public interest in being able to see the evidence, and they must explain on record any decision in favor of secrecy.
They rarely do. Secrecy is convenient — for judges concerned about efficiency, for corporate lawyers concerned about protecting their clients’ reputations, and for plaintiffs’ lawyers seeking speedy resolution for their clients.
The Propecia case in federal court in Brooklyn has followed this familiar pattern. Judge Cogan has, without explanation, allowed Merck and plaintiffs’ lawyers to keep information submitted in court confidential.
Some of these documents slipped through cracks in the wall of secrecy. One was inadvertently entered into the public record, staying in the open for a year before being sealed, but in the meantime, it made its way into an obscure public filing, where Reuters found it. The other was faultily redacted, making it possible for this reporter to read it. The contents of both are reported here for the first time, more than two years after the first was filed in Cogan’s court.
Had he known the additional information about Merck’s clinical trials, Nelson Novick, a dermatology professor at Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York, said he would have been more cautious when prescribing the drug for young men. “I would have appreciated being apprised of this information earlier,” Novick said.
Novick said any medical information about Propecia still being kept secret in court should be unsealed. “It goes without saying that the more information a physician has, the more he can share with the patient and the more informed the decision-making process becomes,” Novick said.
Use of the drug remains widespread. It is now sold as Propecia and, since 2013, in generic versions under the chemical name finasteride. Last year alone, finasteride was prescribed for hair loss more than 1.6 million times in the United States, according to healthcare data company IQVIA. U.S. President Donald Trump has taken it, according to summaries of his past two annual physical exams.
From 2009 to 2018, the FDA received about 5,000 reports of sexual side effects or mental health side effects – and in many cases, both – occurring in men who took Propecia. Of those, about 350 reported suicidal thoughts, and about 50 said a patient committed suicide. The data do not show whether the symptoms resolved after stopping the drug.
Pfaff is among a small group of plaintiffs who haven’t accepted settlement offers from Merck. She said she is pursuing her lawsuit not just for monetary damages, but also to bring to the public’s attention anything Merck knows about mental health problems, particularly suicidal thoughts, that may be associated with Propecia. “If I can save a family from losing their husband, if I could just save one, that would mean the world to me,” she said.
Judge Cogan did not respond to questions about why he has allowed the court filings to remain secret.
RESOLVED IN 'ALL MEN'
Merck developed finasteride in the 1980s. The drug reduces a testosterone-related hormone in certain tissues, including skin and the prostate gland. Merck initially obtained FDA approval in 1992 to market finasteride in a five-milligram pill called Proscar to treat enlarged prostate. Five years later, the FDA approved a one-milligram version, which Merck named Propecia, to treat male pattern baldness.
From the beginning, Merck knew that Propecia could cause sexual dysfunction. In three clinical trials Merck conducted prior to receiving FDA approval of Propecia, 3.8% of the hundreds of men who took the drug experienced sexual side effects, including erectile dysfunction or decreased libido.
That result has appeared on Propecia’s label since the drug hit the market in 1997. The original label, based on a year of clinical trial results, also said the symptoms resolved in “all men” once they stopped taking the drug.
That’s a crucial point for doctors and patients when considering a drug for treating a cosmetic problem. Even a slight risk of sexual dysfunction could give some doctors pause, but they would be reassured if a patient could reverse the problem by no longer taking the pills, said Dr Jerry Avorn, a professor at Harvard Medical School.
The distinction was also important to Merck, according to a sealed document Reuters was able to review because it was filed publicly elsewhere. A 1999 internal marketing study cited in the document found that 40% of men who had heard of Propecia were aware of potential sexual side effects, and that such knowledge would prevent half of those men from taking it. The court document does not say how many men were surveyed.
The sealed document also cites a 2016 sworn deposition in which a plaintiffs’ lawyer asked former Merck marketing vice president Paul Howes: “So you knew internally that if these sexual adverse events were prolonged or lengthened or never went away, that that would be something that would impact sales in a negative way. Right?”
“Yes,” Howes said.
Howes, who held that marketing job from 1998 until 2001, declined to comment for this article.
RESEARCH SUBJECTS DROPPED
In 2002, more than four years after Propecia hit the market, Merck revised the drug’s label to reflect the results of a study that expanded upon two of the drug’s three original clinical trials. The original trials were one-year studies; the extended trials covered four additional years. All were conducted by Merck in the mid- to late 1990s.
The revised label retained the original label’s statement that 3.8% of the 945 men taking Propecia in the first year of research experienced sexual side effects. But the company added that, among the 323 men who took the drug for all five years of the extended study, “the incidence of each type [of sexual side effect] decreased to no more than 0.3% by the fifth year of treatment.”
A 60-page motion plaintiffs’ lawyers filed in Cogan’s court alleges that Merck’s 0.3% figure on the revised label underreports the number of men who experienced sexual side effects during the extended study. The passages of the motion pertaining to the study were redacted. However, Reuters was able to view the blacked-out material after copying it from a digital version of the motion and pasting it into a document in a different format.
The motion cites an email in which a Merck analyst tells executives that 23 men taking Propecia experienced sexual side effects during the final three years of the expanded study. That phase comprised 922 men who took the drug for varying lengths of time, according to a 2002 article Merck published in the European Journal of Dermatology.
The label, as revised in 2002, omits the experiences of nearly all of those men, reporting only on sexual dysfunction in men who took Propecia in the first year of research and in those who took it continuously for all five years. Merck didn’t include the experiences of men who finished the study before the fifth year or who were given placebo doses earlier in the study. The revised label also omitted information about six men who dropped out of the study during the final three years due to sexual side effects.
It is impossible from the numbers Merck has published to tell what percentage of men experienced sexual dysfunction over the full five years.
It is “not fair or standard practice” to report results from only a portion of a multi-year study because it systematically underestimates the risk of any side effect, said Avorn, the Harvard pharmacoepidemiologist who reviewed the court filing and Merck’s statements at Reuters’ request.
Before the 2002 label change, Dr Keith Kaufman, clinical head of Propecia, discussed different ways of interpreting clinical trial data, the plaintiffs’ court filing says. The 0.3% figure is “totally misleading” because, by the fifth year, “you have weeded out the dropouts with the sexual [adverse experiences],” the motion quotes him as saying. The legal filing does not specify who received Kaufman’s correspondence.
Kaufman referred Reuters’ questions to Merck, which said his remarks were unrelated to the language on the label. Merck said that he was referring to a flawed report submitted by an outside expert and that the company settled the litigation before it could provide proper context for Kaufman’s comments.
Plaintiffs’ lawyers filed Kaufman’s original correspondence in court under seal, and it thus cannot be viewed. Merck declined to waive its claims of confidentiality to share that filing and the Merck analyst’s memo with Reuters.
The redacted motion argues that Merck not only underreported the number of men who experienced sexual dysfunction while taking Propecia, but also concealed the duration of those problems. Citing the Merck analyst’s memo, the motion says that of the 23 study subjects who experienced sexual side effects during the last three years of the study, seven continued to experience symptoms when they completed it. The symptoms of nine others resolved after they stopped taking the drug, but the time it took was unknown, the motion says. And of the six men who dropped out of the study, it says, one still had symptoms at least 66 days after stopping treatment.
Merck didn’t know if some of these men’s symptoms resolved, Kaufman said in a deposition.
None of this data described in the plaintiffs’ motion was included on the revised 2002 label. Instead, Merck made a small but significant change to the label’s language: Symptoms stopped in “men” who went off the pills, the label now said, rather than “all men.”
Merck told Reuters that it followed up with patients who dropped out “in accordance with the protocols for the study.” It said it has “consistently maintained that the available evidence does not establish that finasteride … causes sexual dysfunction which persists after drug discontinuation.”
Merck said it provided its five-year trial data to the FDA, which approved the revised label.
The FDA declined to answer questions about what Merck shared with the agency or how it evaluated specific information the company submitted about its Propecia clinical trials. It said it “takes very seriously its role in continuing to monitor and regulate the safety of drugs both before and once they are on the market.”
Dr Michael Irwig, an endocrinology professor at George Washington University who has studied Propecia, reviewed the faultily redacted court filing for Reuters. He said Merck’s numbers “look much better” by excluding men who dropped out, and the difference reflects an overall lack of transparency regarding subjects who experienced sexual side effects, he said.
In 2008, after Swedish regulators investigated reports that sexual side effects continued in men after they stopped taking the drug, Merck changed Propecia’s label in that country to warn that erectile dysfunction had been reported to persist after stopping the drug.
The same year, Kelly Pfaff told her husband about Propecia. John’s hair had started to thin on top. “For whatever reason, it bothered him,” Kelly Pfaff said. She said she encouraged him to look into Propecia because she knew a friend was taking it and had hair “like a Chia Pet.” She now regrets her advice. “I have to sleep with that every night,” she said.
The label prominently warned pregnant women to avoid handling the drug. Kelly was pregnant with their daughter at the time, and she said John warned her not to touch the pills. She said he didn’t mention any other risks.
Reports of depression in men taking Propecia were added to the U.S. label in 2010. This disclosure appeared in the “Postmarketing” section of the label, below the much more favorable description of Merck’s clinical trial results added in 2002.
Meanwhile, the FDA had begun an inquiry after Merck changed its label in European countries to warn about persistent sexual dysfunction. In April 2012, the agency approved another change to the U.S. product label. The agency said at the time that “clear causal links” between the drug and sexual dysfunction had not been established. But, for the first time, the Propecia label acknowledged reports that a range of men’s sexual problems persisted after the men stopped taking the drug.
A patient advocacy group, the Post Finasteride Syndrome Foundation, petitioned the FDA in 2017 to either withdraw Propecia from the market or add a black box warning for sexual and mental health side effects. The FDA has not yet responded to the request.
MERCK BLAMES BALDNESS
The 2012 label change came as John Pfaff was hurtling toward his final crisis. He quit Propecia that spring, four years after starting treatment. Kelly Pfaff said her husband’s decision to go off the drug wasn’t prompted by Merck’s label change, but more a process of elimination of possible culprits. She and her husband entered therapy together.
In a rambling email to his colleagues, he abruptly quit his job in January 2013. Two months later, he was dead.
Kelly Pfaff’s lawsuit cites a peer reviewed study by Irwig, the academic endocrinologist, that found overlap between persistent sexual dysfunction and mental illness among 61 former finasteride users. In the study, 64% of men who experienced sexual problems after they stopped taking the drug also demonstrated moderate-to-severe depression, compared to none of a control group of men with hair loss who hadn’t taken the drug. Forty-four percent reported having thoughts of suicide, compared to none in the control group.
Irwig found these rates to be higher compared to other studies of depression among men with sexual problems. He acknowledged he did not have specific comparative data on bald men experiencing sexual dysfunction. Other published studies have found that Propecia can lead to decreased levels of neurosteroids that act as natural antidepressants.
Some dermatologists have questioned whether selection bias tainted Irwig’s findings and suggested that publicity and lawsuits could be artificially inflating the number of people reporting Propecia side effects. Merck said the study is “flawed” due to several factors, including a small sample size.
Nicole Rogers, a dermatology professor at Tulane University, said she counsels men on the possibility of side effects and tells them harmful impacts will go away if they stop.“For people who have a long family history of [hair loss], who are we to tell them they can’t do it?” Rogers said.
After reviewing the information Reuters found on the Merck clinical trials, Rogers said the sexual problems the men reported could have been caused by other factors, including smoking.
Rogers’s assessment echoed Merck’s position. “Premature hair loss itself, the very condition for which Propecia is prescribed, is associated with low self-esteem, poor body image, and depression,” Merck’s lawyers wrote in a 2017 court filing. “Rather than attribute their sexual difficulties to the common reasons why young men with premature hair loss experience these problems, Plaintiffs instead assign blame to a drug that, once discontinued, is no longer pharmacologically active in the body.”
Sales of Propecia climbed steadily through the 2000s, peaking at $447 million in 2010. Soon after, Merck’s patent expired, but use of finasteride remained strong as cheaper generic versions hit the market.
By then, hundreds of men were suing Merck over Propecia. In 2012, their lawsuits were consolidated before Judge Cogan.
As part of the discovery process, the early phase of litigation when opposing sides request information from each other, the court issued a routine protective order, allowing each side to designate discovery material as confidential before sharing it. The plaintiffs then filed a small handful of those documents in court under seal, citing the protective order as justification for the secrecy.
Once evidence hits the courthouse, however, appellate courts have ruled that judges are required to conduct their own analysis of whether the secrecy outweighs the public interest in transparency. Cogan never did so.
In 2016, Cogan selected four of the Propecia lawsuits to go to trial first. The proceedings marked the first time that some of the evidence described in this article might have been publicly aired.
But Merck settled hundreds of the Propecia lawsuits in April 2018. The first trials were canceled, and the information remained under seal.
Merck agreed to pay a lump sum of $4.3 million, according to a Merck securities filing, to be divided among plaintiffs who settled. In exchange, plaintiffs agreed to drop their claims against the company and not to discuss any confidential court documents, including any that were “inadvertently” filed in public and later placed under seal, according to a copy of one of the settlement agreements reviewed by Reuters.
Fewer than 25 U.S. cases remain pending, including Pfaff’s. Her lawyers signed the protective order and are now reviewing some of the same discovery material Merck provided to other plaintiffs’ lawyers. She says she hopes the case will give the public a full view of what Merck knows about Propecia.
Pfaff, who has moved with her children to Park City, Utah, said she thinks her husband would still be alive had he known how long Propecia’s possible side effects could persist. “We do crazy things for vanity. But if we are going to do that, we should know what the risks are,” Pfaff said. “I’m pretty sure if John knew he would poison his body, he would be bald.”"

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - California trucking companies that haul everything from summer strawberries to cars and Christmas toys say they are under threat from a bill that could turn so-called gig workers into employees.
California state senators late on Tuesday passed AB5, proposed legislation that would set tougher standards for determining which workers can be properly classified as independent contractors. Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom has signaled support for the measure, which would take effect on Jan. 1. 
The legislation threatens to upend a swath of California businesses that rely on freelance drivers. While the spotlight has been on ride-sharing companies  Uber Technologies Inc  (N:UBER) and  Lyft  Inc (O:LYFT), the trucking industry that underpins the U.S. agriculture, retail and industrial sectors is also heavily exposed. 
""It's going to hit all trucking firms small and large,"" said Joseph Rajkovacz, director of governmental affairs for the Western States Trucking Association.
Trucking companies of all stripes call on the roughly 70,000 California independent big rig owners to haul loads in the state and around the country. 
Experts say California's mostly small 137,000 trucking firms are vulnerable to upheaval wrought by AB5. 
""We have a lot of peaks and valleys. It takes all the flexibility away from us,"" said Bill Aboudi, whose eight-truck company serves the Port of Oakland. 
Most drivers who ferry goods to and from massive cargo ships at the port are independent, he said. 
""If nobody can use them, we're going to have a nightmare,"" said Aboudi, who employs seven drivers and said switching to a different employee model would not happen overnight. 
Los Angeles-based Sandra Alzate hires independent owner-operators when her customers, which include Los Angeles Unified School District, have more work than her four-truck company can handle on its own. 
""I'm going to lose clients because I can't provide the trucks they need for their jobs,"" said Alzate, who already planned to invest $400,000 on two truck upgrades and cannot afford to hire additional drivers or buy additional rigs.
""I don't think they understand what the impact will be,"" Alzate said of AB5 supporters.
Proponents of the union-supported bill say it would address employment abuses in the transportation industry, where companies like Uber,  XPO Logistics  Inc (N:XPO) and trucking firm Swift Transportation Holdings Inc (N:KNX) have paid millions of dollars in overtime and wage claims to settle worker misclassification lawsuits. 
Representatives from XPO and Knight-Swift did not respond to requests for comment. Oakland's Aboudi said he is currently settling a misclassification lawsuit involving meal and rest breaks.

SAN JUAN (Reuters) - A long-awaited plan to restructure Puerto Rico's core government debt will finally be filed in court later this month, an attorney for the bankrupt U.S. commonwealth's federally created financial oversight board told a federal judge on Wednesday.
Martin Bienenstock said the latest delay was due to political turmoil on the island that led to last month's resignation of Governor Ricardo Rossello, who was eventually replaced by Wanda Vazquez.
He said while the board expected to file a plan in August, it held off because ""it would have jammed"" the new governor, who took office on Aug. 7.
The board had signaled it could file a plan of adjustment covering roughly $13 billion of bonds and almost $50 billion of unfunded pension obligations as early as April, then set subsequent but vague deadlines in the following months.
Puerto Rico entered bankruptcy in May 2017 to restructure $120 billion of debt and pension obligations.
Bienenstock said ""the relationship between the new government and the oversight board is positive."" Vazquez, who had been Puerto Rico's justice secretary, has been meeting with oversight board officials. Her predecessor, Rossello, had been at odds with the board over spending priorities and other matters, including proposed pension cuts.
Earlier this year, the board asked U.S. District Court Judge Laura Taylor Swain, who is hearing the island's bankruptcy cases, to void billions of dollars of general obligation bonds. It also sued certain bondholders to recoup debt service payments and Wall Street banks and firms that participated in debt issuances.
The board in June announced deals with some creditors over recovery rates for certain bonds and for a pension restructuring.
In July, Swain ordered mediation that could extend into November over the validity of Puerto Rico's GO and other bonds, as well as for other disputes.
So far, Puerto Rico has won court approval for restructurings of debt from its Government Development Bank and Sales Tax Financing Corporation known as COFINA. On Monday, the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority move closer to exiting bankruptcy when two holdout bond insurers joined a deal to restructure its debt."

He made the comment to reporters at the White House.
The concern stems from rising instances of breathing problems experienced by otherwise healthy users of e-cigarettes that they use for vaping. At least six have died, and more than 450 cases have been recorded across the country this summer.
The health issues appear related to the presence of THC oil in vaping products smoked in the Juul e-cigarette. THC is the compound in marijuana that creates a high. Privately held Juul's cigarette normally packages nicotine salts from leaf tobacco into one-time use cartridges.
The Food and Drug Administration is finalizing plans to pull all flavored e-cigarette cartridges from the market, leaving only the tobacco flavor, in an effort to discourage youth vaping.   Altria Group   (NYSE:MO) fell 1%, while Philip Morris International (NYSE:PM) lost 0.4%.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) said Wednesday it was recalling 3.46 million U.S. pickup trucks and SUVs to address a vacuum pump issue that could make braking more difficult and that has been linked to 113 accidents and 13 injuries.
The recall covers 2014-2018 model year vehicles, including some Cadillac Escalade, Chevrolet Silverado, Chevrolet Tahoe, GMC Sierra, Chevrolet Suburban and GMC Yukon vehicles.
In late June, GM recalled 310,000 vehicles in Canada for the same issue. GM did not immediately explain why the Canadian recall occurred more than two months before it called back the vehicles in the United States.
The recall was triggered because the amount of vacuum created by the vacuum pump may decrease over time, GM told the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) in documents posted on Wednesday.
The NHTSA opened a preliminary investigation into the issue last November, and said it had reports of nine related crashes and two injuries. It provided GM in July with additional field reports that prompted the automaker to open an investigation.
GM said it could affect braking in ""rare circumstances."" The NHTSA said in a statement the ""vehicles may experience brake boost failure, which would require increased brake pedal effort, leading to a hard brake pedal feel, and potentially increased stopping distance.""
GM said dealers will reprogram the electronic brake control module to improve how the system utilizes the hydraulic brake boost assist function when vacuum assist is depleted. 
GM said the vacuum assist pump, which is lubricated with engine oil that flows into the pump through a filter screen, can in some cases lose effectiveness over time, as debris such as oil sludge can accumulate on the filter screen.
GM told NHTSA that prior model years used a different brake assist system design, and vehicles manufactured after 2018 were not equipped with the affected pump design.
Separately, GM said on Wednesday it is recalling 270,000 additional U.S. vehicles in three smaller recalls, including 177,000 2018 Chevrolet Malibu cars with 1.5L turbo engines because an error in the engine control module software may result in the fuel injectors being disabled.

It is also recalling 91,000 2019 Chevrolet Express and GMC Savana vehicles because the seatbelt-unfastened warning light will not illuminate for approximately five seconds after the ignition is moved to the ""on"" or ""start"" position, which means they are not in compliance with federal motor safety regulations.

(Reuters) - U.S. stocks rose on Wednesday, lifted by Apple a day after the launch of its latest iPhones and as China moved to ease trade tensions with the United States by exempting certain goods from additional retaliatory tariffs.
Apple Inc (O:AAPL) rose 2.60%, boosting all three major indexes by the most, as it also rolled out a streaming TV service at a price that undercuts Walt  Disney  Co (N:DIS) and Netflix Inc (O:NFLX).
The gains took Apple's market valuation above $1 trillion and lifted the wider technology sector (SPLRCT) by 0.68%, the biggest boost among the 11 major S&P 500 sectors.
Tech stocks bounced from a drop in the previous session, which saw investors moving to more value-oriented stocks from growth shares.
Adding to the positive momentum, China's finance ministry moved to exempt 16 types of U.S. goods, including lubricants and some animal feed ingredients, from additional retaliatory tariffs, ahead of a planned meeting between trade negotiators.
While on the surface, the move is seen as a friendly gesture to thaw relations with the United States, analysts are skeptical about how much it will move the needle in resolving a protracted trade war that has hurt the global economy.
The nature of the goods that are being exempted are staples and indicates that China's decision is likely more to do with supporting its own economy rather than extending an olive branch to the United States, Ed Egilinsky, head of alternative investments at Direxion said.
""There's a big difference between today's move and sitting down at the negotiating table and actually ironing out a deal.""
Comments from a senior White House adviser on Tuesday urging investors to be patient about resolving the dispute further downplayed expectations that a trade deal would be agreed this year.
Investors held out on big bets ahead of stimulus decisions from central banks to stem a global slowdown. The U.S. Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank are expected to cut interest rates at their policy meetings over the next two weeks.

(Reuters) - The Donerail Group, an investment firm led by former activist hedge fund Starboard Value LP executive William Wyatt, has built a stake in  Mobile Mini  Inc (O:MINI) and is pushing the world's largest provider of portable storage solutions to explore a sale, people familiar with the matter said on Wednesday.
The position, Donerail's first major investment, comes at a time of leadership changes at Phoenix, Arizona-based Mobile Mini, which announced in May that CEO Erik Olsson will become chairman in October. He will be succeeded at the helm by the President and Chief Operating Officer Kelly Williams (NYSE:WMB).
Donerail has asked Mobile Mini to explore strategic alternatives, including a potential sale, given the fragmented nature of the portable storage sector, the sources said, requesting anonymity because the matter is confidential. It was not clear how Mobile Mini plans to respond.
Mobile Mini did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Donerail, which was launched by Wyatt last year, declined to comment.
Mobile Mini shares rose 5.3% to $34.90 on the news, giving the company a market capitalization of close to $1.6 billion. The company also had a debt pile of $900 million as of the end of June. 
Mobile Mini has a rental fleet of about 198,000 storage containers and office units, as well 12,700 liquid and solid containment units and pumps that it also rents out. The company has 155 locations in the United States, Britain and Canada.
Mobile Mini's shares have lost 17% of their value in the last 12 months. The company's most recent quarterly earnings call in July said the business has been pressured by uncertainty fueled by Britain's protracted negotiations to cease membership in the European Union.
Mergers and acquisitions in the storage sector have been on the rise. Last year, WillScot Corp, another U.S. warehousing and storage services company, acquired Modular Space Holdings Inc, a provider of office trailers, portable storage units and modular buildings, for $1.2 billion.

(Reuters) - U.S. stocks rose slightly on Wednesday as China's move to ease trade tensions with the United States soothed investor nerves, while shares of Apple gained a day after the launch of its latest iPhones.
Apple Inc (O:AAPL) rose 1.79% and provided the biggest boost to all three major indexes, a day after it unveiled new iPhones and rolled out a streaming TV service at a price that undercuts  Disney  (N:DIS) and Netflix (O:NFLX).
The gains took the Silicon Valley giant's market valuation just shy of $1 trillion and lifted the wider technology sector (SPLRCT).
Adding to the positive momentum, China's finance ministry exempted 16 types of U.S. goods from additional retaliatory tariffs, ahead of a planned meeting between trade negotiators.
While the move is seen as a friendly gesture to thaw relations with the United States, analysts are skeptical about how much it will move the needle in resolving a trade war that has hurt the global economy.
""The exemption could be seen as a gesture of sincerity toward the US ahead of negotiations in October, but is probably more a means of supporting the (Chinese) economy,"" Iris Pang, a Greater China economist with ING, wrote in a note.
Comments from a senior White House adviser on Tuesday urging investors to be patient about resolving the dispute further downplayed expectations that a trade deal would be agreed this year.
Markets were largely subdued as investors held out on big bets ahead of stimulus decisions from central banks to stem a global slowdown. The U.S. Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank are expected to cut interest rates at their policy meetings over the next two weeks.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday renewed his attacks on Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, saying that the central bank should get interest rates down to ""ZERO, or less.""

Slowing jetliner sales at Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co. have sent its book-to-bill ratio, a measure of demand, plunging to levels not seen since the 2009 recession. Investors will be looking for insights into the outlook for commercial aircraft on Wednesday morning, when Boeing Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg makes his first public comments since the company reported second-quarter earnings in July.
The Chicago-based planemaker netted negative 85 aircraft orders this year through Aug. 31, as airline bankruptcies overseas wiped out sales gains and the worldwide grounding of its 737 Max in March was an added drag. The company delivered 276 aircraft over that stretch for a book-to-bill of -0.31, the first time that ratio has been negative in a decade.
Companies like to keep the measure at around one to replace the backlog they’re shipping to customers.
Boeing’s slump while its best-selling 737 model is sidelined is hardly surprising. Moreover, the ratio matters less for the company right now since it booked $474.3 billion in orders earlier this decade amid the largest sales boom in aerospace history -- a backlog that equates to about seven years of production.
More worrying is that rival Airbus SE has just 95 net orders year-to-date, against 500 deliveries.
“If the results were just Max-related, you’d expect Airbus to be doing better, and they’re not,” said George Ferguson, an analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence. “It’s a sign of the times.”
Boeing rose less than 1% to $370.88 at 9:37 a.m. in New York. Airbus advanced less than 1% to 123.14 euros.

333,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 11, 2019 07:55AM ET</span>",Aramco’s Long-Awaited IPO May Be Kryptonite to Saudi Stocks,"(Bloomberg) -- It’s been at least three years in the making, but it’s just dawned on investors what a share sale by Saudi Aramco would do to the Arab world’s biggest stock exchange.
The Tadawul All Share Index almost wiped out this year’s gains after the kingdom’s efforts to line up banks for the sale spurred market players to realize the initial public offering really is happening. About 90% of the index’s stocks fell.
“All local index constituencies should suffer outflows,” said Slava Breusov, a senior analyst with the emerging and frontier equities team at AllianceBernstein in New York.
The IPO is part of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s efforts to modernize the economy and diversify the nation’s revenue from oil, including turning the bourse into a gateway for foreign investment. The kingdom spent years relaxing rules for foreign traders and aligning its market with global peers, culminating in its inclusion in MSCI Inc. and FTSE Russell’s developing-nations equity benchmarks.
The world’s most profitable company is planning a listing in Riyadh, and potentially another internationally, although the timings of either haven’t been announced. The energy giant is considering first selling around a 1% stake through a listing on the Saudi stock exchange, with the possibility of offering another 1% on the local bourse at a later date, one person with knowledge of the matter said.
“Barring some sort of liquidity injection by the Saudi government, I would expect an Aramco local listing to be a drain on the rest of the market as Aramco’s behemoth size crowds out other local investments,” said Adam Choppin, an investment officer at FIS Group in Philadelphia.
The index fell as much as 2.5% as of 2:01 p.m. in Riyadh.
What It’s Worth
Prince Mohammed in 2016 valued Aramco at about $2 trillion, which means floating 1% would be valued at about $20 billion. That would account for about 4% of the market. To be sure, Bloomberg Intelligence values Aramco at $1.1 trillion because of the likelihood that Saudi Arabia will need to limit its output, and other analysts have said about $1.5 trillion. Brent crude at about $60 a barrel isn’t enough to fund the the kingdom’s budget, which needs prices at $80 a barrel or more.
But even if Aramco’s worth is lower than the kingdom’s estimates, it would still dwarf other equities. Its profit in the first half of the year was more than four times the combined earnings of 170 Saudi publicly traded companies that reported earnings, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
And assuming the company’s valuation is about $1.5 trillion, a 1% listing would put Aramco at 5.2% of the main stock index, according to Mohamad Al Hajj, an equities strategist at EFG-Hermes in Dubai. That would dilute the dominance of other market heavyweights, such as Al Rajhi Bank, which currently accounts for 15% of the index. The equity would receive roughly $1.9 billion in inflows from MSCI and FTSE passive trackers alone, almost a tenth of total foreign inflows into the Saudi bourse so far this year.
“Considering the size of Aramco’s IPO and its expected weight in indexes, the company will have a significant effect not only on the local gauge, but also on global indexes,” said AllianceBernstein’s Breusov."
334,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 11, 2019 07:17AM ET</span>",Trafigura Sees Oil Slide Near $50 Prompting Deeper OPEC Cuts,"(Bloomberg) -- Brent crude could slump toward a level it hasn’t seen since December 2018 prompting deeper output cuts from OPEC and its allies, according to one of world’s biggest oil traders.
Macroeconomic headwinds and rising supply will chart a course toward $50 a barrel for the global benchmark over the next six months, which is about 20% lower than where it’s currently, Ben Luckock, Trafigura Beheer BV’s co-head of global oil trading, said during an interview in Singapore. It’s likely to return to a range of $70 to $75 in the medium to long-term, a level cheap enough for consumers but valuable enough to make producers money, he said.
But for the next six months at least, prices are likely to drift lower before spurring OPEC+ to cut further and U.S. shale drillers to reduce spending, slowing down one of the fastest-growing sources of output, he said. Brent crude added 0.8% to $62.90 a barrel as of 12:34 p.m. Singapore time. It has averaged about $65 this year, and was last below $51 in late December.
A lower price “is one of the few things that either galvanizes OPEC, makes it harder for shale to perform, or stimulates demand,” Luckock said at the trading house’s office in the city state. “I can see us drifting toward $50 in the short term, but I think the medium to long term price is $70 to $75.”
OPEC Fraying
The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies including Russia have been working since 2016 to balance global markets through output cuts, but at current price levels, Trafigura sees the coalition fraying. Iraq has shunned its commitments, while stalwarts like Saudi Arabia and Kuwait are seeking to restart a 500,000-barrel-a-day neutral zone field next year, said Saad Rahim, the trading house’s chief strategist and global head of research.
“We don’t think the current level of OPEC cuts and compliance is actually enough to make oil go higher,” Luckock said. Still, lower prices could rekindle the group’s urgency to work together and even deepen curbs, he added.
See also: OPEC’s New Saudi Kingpin Faces Demand Woes That Beat Predecessor
Oil will need to drop to $40 to $45 a barrel to spur OPEC to make deeper cuts, Gabriel Mbaga Obiang Lima, the Minister of Mines and Hydrocarbons for member country Equatorial Guinea said during an interview in Abu Dhabi on Tuesday. The cartel needs to trim another 500,000 barrels a day to boost prices to $70, industry consultant FGE said in a note the same day.
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. sees 1 million barrels a day in deeper output cuts needed in 2020 to defend prices at $60 a barrel in the face of rising non-OPEC supply. On the contrary, the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies said rising supply may dissuade the Saudis from seeking deeper cuts.
Trafigura sees global production growing by 1.9 million barrels a day next year, with nearly half coming from shale. That will outpace demand growth, which they see at 1.6 million barrels a day. The OPEC+ pact currently has a target to reduce supply by 1.2 million barrels a day.
One Solver
Trafigura is shipping U.S. shale from its facility in Corpus Christi and buyers in Europe and Asia have begun asking if they can purchase the crude via long-term deals, Luckock said. The group is bullish on the Permian Basin and is looking at expanding its export project by building an offshore buoy that would allow direct loading onto the world’s biggest crude tankers.
Still, Luckock thinks the oil industry is relying too much on continued U.S. shale growth to meet demand, and isn’t investing in more expensive, long-term projects like deepwater wells.
“In the 18 month- to 5-year term, you get back into the story where you only have one solver for global demand in U.S. shale, there’s underinvestment in deepwater, demand could recover, and you can see how you could return back to a more normalized price,” he said.

The biggest company that absolutely nobody has ever heard of is called   Prosus   (AS:PRX). It’s a holding company for the international Internet assets of South African investment firm Naspers (JO:NPNJn).
More than anything, it’s a vehicle for Naspers’ 31% stake in Tencent Holdings (HK:0700), the Chinese social media and gaming giant, whose value has mushroomed from $31 million back in 2001 to $130 billion today. But it also holds stakes in payments and food delivery companies, notably Delivery Hero (BE:DHER) and Takeaway.com, as well as other social media assets like Russia’s Mail.ru (LON:MAILRq) and online marketplaces such as OLX group.
Last year, it made a net profit of $4.25 billion, due largely to a $1.6 billion windfall gain on the sale of its stake in India’s Flipkart to Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Stores. Even after that disposal, the company is easily the largest consumer Internet company listed in Europe.
The company reckons its portfolio companies’ products and services are used regularly by around one-fifth of the world’s population. The listing “will give international tech investors the opportunity to directly invest in an attractive Internet portfolio,” Naspers said in a video on its website detailing the transaction.
Naspers issued shares worth around 25% in the new company to all its shareholders ahead of the listing. Euronext Amsterdam had given an indicative price of 58.70 euros a share, implying a market value of 95.3 billion euros ($105 billion).
However, Reuters reported the shares jumped to 76 euros on opening and only gave up a fraction of those gains in subsequent trading. That made it immediately the third-largest stock on the Amsterdam exchange by market value, behind Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) and   Unilever   (LON:ULVR).
The listing came on a day when Europe’s markets were making broad advances on fresh hopes of détente on trade between China and the U.S. Earlier in the day, China had published a list of products to be exempted from its latest tariffs on imports from the U.S., which included cancer drugs and lubricant base oil but not the far more sensitive and economically important agricultural products such as soybeans and pork.

OSLO (Reuters) - Airbus has ordered checks on three types of helicopters following a fatal crash in Norway, Norwegian authorities said on Wednesday.
Five Norwegians and their Swedish pilot died when their AS350B3e helicopter crashed in Arctic Norway on Aug. 31. Norwegian investigators have not concluded on the cause.
Following preliminary findings linked to the connection between the engine and the main gearbox, Airbus Helicopters has issued an emergency alert service bulletin (EASB) calling for visual inspections of this area on all recently delivered AS350, AS550 and EC130 helicopters, investigators said.
""According to Airbus Helicopters, issuance of the EASB (notice) is a precautionary measure to ensure the continued airworthiness of the helicopter type,"" the Accident Investigation Board Norway said in a statement.
The crashed aircraft had flown just 73 hours, it added.
Airbus was not available for immediate comment.
Helitrans, operator of the crashed helicopter, said it had performed the prescribed inspections on its 15 remaining helicopters of the same type.
""There were no discoveries of any kind. In accordance with the recommendations from Airbus, the helicopters are thus cleared to fly and will be put back into operation,"" the company said in a statement.
In 2016 an Airbus Super Puma helicopter crashed off the coast of Norway, killing all 13 people aboard, the result of metal fatigue in its gearbox.
As a result, Norwegian authorities recommended Airbus revise the design of the main gearbox of its AS 332 L2 and EC 225 LP Super Puma helicopters. These models are different from the model that crashed in August.
In the 2016 crash the Super Puma's main rotor blades separated from the helicopter as it was ferrying passengers from an offshore oil platform."

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Chinese suppliers and manufacturers have stepped up their presence at the Frankfurt auto show, capitalizing on a strong position in electric technologies forced on European carmakers by regulators seeking to curb pollution.
Though the number of exhibitors has fallen to 800 in 2019 from 994 in 2017, Chinese automakers and suppliers now make up the biggest foreign contingent, with 79 companies, up from 73.
Several European and Japanese carmakers including  Fiat  (MI:FCHA), Alfa Romeo, Nissan (T:7291) and Toyota (T:7203) have skipped the show as the industry cuts costs.
Europe's automakers face multibillion-euro investments to develop electric and autonomous cars, forcing them to rely on Chinese companies for key technologies such as lithium ion battery cell production, an area where Asian suppliers dominate.
German firms are striking major deals with Chinese suppliers to help them meet stringent EU anti-pollution rules, which were introduced in the wake of Volkswagen's (DE:VOWG_p) 2015 emissions cheating scandal.
""All carmakers face the challenge that they will have to fulfill fleet consumption targets,"" Matthias Zentgraf, regional president for Europe at China's Contemporary Amperex Technology (CATL) (SZ:300750), told Reuters.
Zentgraf said he expected further supply deals to be struck in Europe this year following agreements with BMW (DE:BMWG) and Volkswagen.
 Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) on Wednesday said it had chosen China-backed Farasis Energy to supply battery cells for its Mercedes-Benz electrification push.
Farasis is building a 600 million euro ($663 million) factory in east Germany, close to where Chinese rival CATL is erecting a 1.8 billion euro battery plant.
SVOLT Energy Technology, which was carved out of China's Great Wall Motor Co (SS:601633) (HK:2333), told Reuters it would start building battery cells in Europe at a new 2 billion euro plant in 2023.
TIPPING POINT 
Chinese companies are also giving Europe more attention since the United States and China embarked on a global trade war, which has resulted in tariffs. 
""We put Europe up in priority,"" said Daniel Kirchert, chief executive of Chinese electric car maker Byton. 
""We are at a tipping point"" for acceptance of electric vehicles in Europe, Kirchert, a former BMW executive, added.
Byton has taken its prototype vehicles on road shows in Europe, and received expressions of interest from 20,000 customers, he said. In electric vehicle hot spots, such as Norway and the Netherlands, ""we see a very positive response."" 
Byton plans to export vehicles from its factory in Nanjing, to Europe in 2021, Kirchert said, adding that exporting to the United States would be a challenge if Washington and Beijing did not resolve their trade war. 
He said Byton still hoped to launch in the United States in 2021, but tariffs would threaten the company's goal of selling vehicles at a starting price of about $45,000. 
""We decided no matter what"" Byton will launch in the United States, even at a higher price, he said.
China's Great Wall Motor may consider building car manufacturing facilities in the European Union once its sales there hit 50,000 units a year, its chairman told Reuters at the show. 
German carmakers have been forced to accelerate electrification plans after the EU imposed a 37.5% cut in carbon dioxide emissions between 2021 and 2030 in addition to a 40% cut in emissions between 2007 and 2021.
PSA Group (PA:PEUP) Chief Executive Carlos Tavares used the show to step up criticism of Europe's aggressive approach toward emissions limits. 
""The word dialogue has become meaningless in Europe,"" he said, referring to the requirements placed on the auto industry.
""Politicians can decide rules without any discussion with industry,"" he told journalists on the sidelines of the show. 
Electric cars made up only 1.5% of global sales last year, or 1.26 million of the 86 million passenger vehicles sold, JATO Dynamics said.
If carmakers fail to meet the 2021 targets they could face a combined 33 billion euros in fines, analysts at Evercore ISI have estimated.

They also estimate it will cost the auto industry an aggregate 15.3 billion euros to comply, assuming a 60 euro cost per gram to reduce CO2 emissions for premium carmakers and 40 euros per gram of CO2 reduction for volume manufacturers.

340,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 11, 2019 05:32AM ET</span>","Apple's new, lower priced iPhone draws tepid response in Asia","By Josh Horwitz and Heekyong Yang
HANGZHOU, China/SEOUL (Reuters) - Apple Inc's (O:AAPL) new, lower priced iPhone that comes with a faster processor but lacks 5G technology disappointed Asia, where cheaper and feature-packed handsets from rivals are already available.
The iPhone 11, launched on Tuesday for $50 less than last year's base XR model, was met with a limp response from social media users in Asian markets that are dominated by Huawei Technologies and Samsung Electronics (KS:005930).
Lowering the entry price point, a rare move from Apple, was likely an effort to attract buyers in China, where Apple has ceded ground to Huawei due to a surge in support from patriotic Chinese consumers after the Chinese brand was caught in the U.S.-China trade standoff, said analysts.
Despite the reduction, the iPhone 11, and even the higher-end models with more camera lenses, are set to come up short in Asia.
""Apple's new phones were no surprise at all. Only tangible change is having an additional camera on their premium model,"" said Park Sung-soon, an analyst at Seoul-based Cape Investment & Securities.
""However, it is noticeable that Apple has made a price cut for the newest iPhone for about $50, which is a very rare move for the company. The move might be aiming to manage and reduce potential risks drawn by the U.S.-China trade war.""
The iPhone 11 will have two back cameras and is priced starting at $699, down from $749 for the XR last year. On Tuesday, Apple also dropped the price of the XR by $150.
The more expensive iPhone 11 Pro will have three cameras on the back and starts at $999. The bigger screen iPhone 11 Pro Max starts at $1,099.
(Graphic: Apple unveils new iPhones - https://graphics.reuters.com/APPLE-IPHONE/0100B28N18J/APPLE-IPHONE.jpg)
""Since we still have to wait a year for 5G, why not just buy Huawei on Monday,"" said one user on China's Twitter-like service Weibo. Huawei and smaller rival Vivo have already released 5G models in China, and Samsung in South Korea.
A meme doing the rounds on Chinese social media featured Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook bragging about the new features and Richard Yu, CEO of Huawei's consumer business group, shutting him down by pointing out that Huawei has had those features for years.
""(Apple) just added one more camera lens and called it a new feature, meanwhile it is still too pricey,"" said a user on South Korea's Naver.com web portal.
One of the main draws of the new launch for U.S. buyers - a $5 per month Netflix-like streaming service - will not be available in China.
FEATURES VS PRICE
Counterpoint analyst Neil Shah said the entry price, while lowered by Apple, remains high compared to local rivals. Combined with the lack of 5G, that made the new iPhones ""less attractive and future-proof"" for Chinese consumers, Shah said, forecasting that Apple will sell 30-35 million iPhones in China this year, down from 63 million phones in 2015.
Apple's share of the China market in the June quarter fell to 5.8% from 6.4% in the year earlier period, according to research firm Canalys. It has also lost ground in South Korea, with market share dropping to 11.2% from 12.5%, according to research firm Strategy Analytics.
In India, a market that Apple has said is key for growth, reaction to the new phones was muted as well.
""I don't believe customers will buy more iPhones now because the new models sport more cameras, it will not move the needle much for them,"" said Navkendar Singh, research director at IDC India.
Customers in India who care more about owning Apple-branded phones over the latest model are now likely to buy the discounted XR instead, Singh said.
Still, some analysts said that Apple's decision to lower the entry price for the new iPhone, one of the most discussed topics on Weibo on Wednesday, was a positive sign.
""We think the lower iPhone 11 price point and trade-in program will help promote upgrades, specifically in China, while the Apple Arcade and TV+ offerings will help accelerate services growth,"" CFRA analyst Angelo Zino said in a research note.
The new phones will be available to order on Friday and start shipping Sept. 20."
341,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 11, 2019 05:27AM ET</span>",Investors unwind bearish bets as optimism grows on trade and stimulus,"By Sujata Rao
LONDON (Reuters) - World stocks rose for the sixth straight day on Wednesday and bond prices fell as investors continued to unwind safety bets, encouraged by hopes of a resolution to the Sino-U.S. trade standoff and signs Europe may be preparing to ease budget spending rules.
Higher-risk assets such as equities and emerging markets rose almost across the board at the expense of safe-haven plays such as gold and bonds, as political risk appeared to ease in Britain, Italy and Hong Kong. 
U.S. President Donald Trump's firing of hawkish national security adviser John Bolton was also seen as a positive, as it could potentially lead to an easing of tensions with Iran.
There are hints China will go full-throttle with growth stimulating measures following a raft of dismal data: having already eased banks' cash curbs, it has now scrapped quota restrictions on two inbound investment schemes in order to lure more foreign capital.
Investors are also awaiting the European Central Bank's meeting on Thursday at which it is expected to cut interest rates and unveil more bond buying, though policymakers' comments have recently raised doubts about the extent of stimulus that could be delivered.
""We're seeing yields backing up and safe havens and defensive equities underperform so we are seeing a bit rotation. I don't think it's a structural shift, it's just that markets went too far and too soon, and we are seeing alleviation of that move,"" said Justin Onuekwusi, a fund manager at Legal & General Investment Management.
""The market is being driven by two extremes: one if we get further deceleration in trade, the probability of recession becomes quite high. But if we get a (Sino-U.S. trade deal) we could see confidence coming back,"" he added.
By 0830 GMT, MSCI's world equity index was up 0.3% following 0.5-1.5% gains across Asian bourses, including Tokyo Seoul and Hong Kong. A pan-European equity index rose toward five-week highs while futures implied a slightly firmer open on Wall Street.
Currency markets too reflected the risk-on mood, the dollar strengthening 0.2% to 107.795 yen, its highest in six weeks, and the British pound hovering near six-week highs of $1.2385 hit earlier in the week.
The yen had rocketed towards a 2019 high in August as investors fretted about recession and market selloffs. Forex traders often buy the yen in times of uncertainty because of Japan's vast current account surplus and because Japanese investors usually bring money home when global markets tank.
But since the start of September it's fallen almost 2%.
""Yen weakness has been reinforced overnight by speculation that China will implement further measures to ease the negative economic impact from the trade war with the U.S.,"" MUFG analysts told clients.
Broader risk appetite fed through into gains for both the Australian and New Zealand dollars, which were up 0.1% each. Emerging currencies touched the highest since mid-August, according to an MSCI index. 
BOND UNWIND
Expectations the ECB will push interest rates deeper into negative territory have weighed on the euro, which has shed 3% since June.
But recent comments from policymakers have played down the prospect of sizeable asset purchases. That alongside signs Germany might eventually ease its long-held opposition to loosening budget rules, lifted bond yields across the bloc.
Finance Minister Olaf Scholz said on Tuesday that Germany could counter economic crises by injecting billions of euros into the economy. That lifted Germany's 30-year borrowing costs above zero for the first time in over a month while 10-year bond yields too are 20 basis points above record lows reached a week ago.
""The recent market moves illustrate that expectations maybe went a bit too far, and with the ECB hawks on parade, doubts were raised on whether the ECB could meet the high expectation,"" Jan Von Gerich, chief analyst at Nordea, told the Reuters Global Markets Forum.
""I am still expecting a full package of measures.""
U.S. 10-year Treasuries yields also rose back toward a one-month high of 1.745% hit on Tuesday while Japanese 10-year yields too approached one-month high of minus 0.200%. 
The U.S. Federal Reserve is expected to deliver a 25 basis-point cut when it meets next week, while sources told Reuters policymakers were open to discussing the possibility of expanding stimulus at their Sept 18-19 meeting.
On commodity markets, Brent futures hovered near their strongest in six weeks, despite small losses on Tuesday after the sacking of Bolton as it raised the prospect of Iranian exports returning to the market.

Gold prices snapped a four-day losing streak to rise around 0.3% but they have shed more than 4%, or over $60, since scaling a more-than six-year peak of $1,557 on Sept. 4.

(Reuters) - European shares rose to six-week highs on Wednesday, as China eased trade worries by saying it would exempt some U.S. goods from additional tariffs, with eyes also moving to a European Central Bank meeting expected to deliver more economic stimulus.
Euro zone stocks (STOXXE) were up 0.5% at 0831 GMT, with investors piling into banks (SX7P), miners (SXPP) and auto parts (SXAP) shares for a second day.
Germany's trade-sensitive DAX's (GDAXI) rose 0.6%, while London's FTSE 100 (FTSE) jumped 0.9% and led the wider pan-European STOXX 600 index (STOXX) higher.
In the latest sign that tensions with the United States could be cooling, China's finance ministry said 16 types of U.S. goods would be exempted from additional retaliatory tariffs effective Sept. 17.
""The China (tariff) exemption has bolstered optimism,"" said Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex in London. ""It's like a conciliatory nod between the two superpowers and a reminder that those channels are still open.""
Markets now await a response to China's move from Washington after months of tit for tat moves that have hurt global growth and spurred a handful of stock market sell-offs.
All of the major European indexes have recouped losses sustained in a rough August for markets, with the STOXX up about 7% since touching a low of 361.07 last month.
However, analysts were still far from predicting that a U.S.-China trade deal could be struck this year.
""An exemption list of just 16 items will not change China's stance,"" Iris Pang, a Greater China economist with ING, wrote in a note. ""We believe that China will stand very firm in the negotiations.""
All eyes are now on the ECB's monetary policy meeting on Thursday, where it is widely expected to cut interest rates and restart an asset purchase program at a time when the euro zone's main economy - Germany - is slipping toward recession.

346,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 11, 2019 02:37AM ET</span>",Seoul to file WTO complaint over Japan's 'discriminatory' export curbs,"By Hyunjoo Jin
SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea plans to file a complaint over Japan's tighter export controls at the World Trade Organization on Wednesday, accusing Tokyo of being ""politically motivated"" and ""discriminatory"" in an escalating row rooted in wartime history. 
In July, Japan imposed tighter controls on exports of three materials to South Korea used in smartphone chips and displays following a diplomatic dispute over compensation for forced laborers during Japan's occupation of Korea during World War Two.
The complaint intends ""to prevent the act of abusing trade for political purposes from recurring,"" South Korea's Trade Minister Yoo Myung-Hee said at a briefing. 
Bilateral relations deteriorated after South Korea's Supreme Court last year ordered two Japanese companies to compensate wartime workers in a ruling that Tokyo said violated international law. Japan says the issue of compensation was settled under a 1965 treaty. 
The dispute has rippled through security cooperation over North Korea, with Seoul deciding to scrap a military intelligence-sharing pact with Japan, inviting criticism from both Tokyo and Washington.
Yoo said South Korean firms are ""faced with serious damage"" as a result of the export curbs, which also cast uncertainty into the global supply chain and the global economy. 
The materials affected by Japan's export controls are fluorinated polyimides, photoresists and hydrogen fluoride, which are used by South Korean tech firms such as Samsung Electronics (KS:005930).
Japan now requires exporters to seek permission each time they want to ship those materials, which takes up to 90 days. Previously, it only took a couple of weeks to ship, Yoo said. 
Only three shipments have been approved since Tokyo took action on July 4. 
Japanese officials had cited ""inadequate management"" of sensitive items exported to South Korea as a reason for the export curbs.
Japan's industry minister, Hiroshige Seko, said on Wednesday that the country would respond ""in line with WTO procedures.""
""We intend to thoroughly explain Japan's stance that our actions are in accordance with WTO rules,"" he said at a news conference.
""Seoul's complaint will not lead Japan to drop its tighter export curbs on the three items, but this will certainly put pressure on Japan to cautiously implement the measures,"" said Ahn Duk-geun, a professor at Seoul National University.
60-DAY CONSULTATION
As the first step of WTO dispute settlement, South Korea will request consultations with Japan and seek the end of the export curbs. If that does not resolve the issues, South Korea will request a WTO panel ruling on the cases, the trade minister told a briefing.
The talks could take 60 days or more, a trade ministry official said. 
Yoo also said South Korea was considering ""all options"" in response to Tokyo's decision to drop Korea from the so-called white list of preferred trading partners. South Korea is taking steps to drop Japan from its own white list, a move that experts say is likely to prompt Japan to launch a complaint at the WTO. 
But WTO cases can take years. 
""They should resolve the matter politically and diplomatically, but chances are low for such a resolution because both governments are using the dispute to their own political advantage,"" said Cheong In-kyo, an economics professor at Inha University. 
Meanwhile, the WTO Appellate Body on Tuesday broadly upheld an April 2018 panel ruling against South Korea's anti-dumping duties on imports of pneumatic valves from Japan.

But South Korean trade officials said the decision is not a victory for Japan, arguing that the WTO rejected most of Japan's claims, making it unlikely Seoul will need to scrap anti-dumping duties on Japanese valves.

347,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 11, 2019 01:25AM ET</span>","U.S. corporate bond, IPO markets heat up as recession fears persist","By David Randall
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Corporate America appears to be rushing to get the most out of the decade-long bull market in stocks and bonds before a possible recession and election-year stock market volatility slam the IPO and credit windows shut.
Approximately 70 companies have registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to go public, according to estimates from Renaissance Capital, while $72 billion in investment-grade corporate debt – a figure nearly as large as the total issuance in August - was issued last week, according to data from Dealogic.
The rash of new deals comes as the U.S.-China trade war weighs on the global economy, helping push 30-year Treasury yields to record lows and increasing fears of a global economic slowdown. U.S. manufacturing activity contracted for the first time in three years in August, while construction spending barely rose in July, helping send business confidence lower, according to the Institute for Supply Management.
As a result, even companies like Apple Inc (O:AAPL) and Walt  Disney  Co (N:DIS) that have billions of cash on hand are taking on new corporate debt, taking advantage of the opportunity to lock in historically low borrowing costs while investor demand for yield remains high.
""Companies might as well take advantage while they can. Corporations are getting in while the credit window remains wide open as you just never know when it slams shut,"" said Greg Peters, head of multisector and strategy at PGIM Fixed Income, which oversees more than $809 billion in assets under management.
The increase in corporate debt on the heels of a 24% decline in borrowing in 2018 will likely be a key topic of discussion at the Federal Reserve's policy meeting scheduled to begin Sept. 17. While the market is currently predicting a 91% chance that the Fed cuts interest rates, according to data from the CME Group (NASDAQ:CME), signs that corporate lending remains robust may undermine the economic need for lower rates, fund managers and analysts say.
""From where I sit obviously money is very cheap right now and bond prices reflect a full-blown recession, but I don't think that's in the offing,"" said Eddy Vataru, a portfolio manager at the Osterweis Total Return fund. ""We are going through a weak patch now but it feels like as the days pass and it's clear that inflation is not obsolete, the market will have to re-price for that.""
IPO FEVER
Expectations for increased stock market volatility and a desire for liquidity on the part of venture capital and private equity firms are helping fuel the packed slate of upcoming IPOs through the end of the year, said Kathleen Smith, principal at Renaissance Capital, a provider of institutional research and IPO ETFs. Food delivery company Postmates Inc and fitness startup Peloton Interactive are among the companies expected to go public by the end of 2019.
""The IPO market hasn't shut down, and won't shut down until returns are poor,"" she said, as companies such as plant-based meat maker  Beyond Meat Inc  (O:BYND) and video conferencing company  Zoom Video Communications  Inc (O:ZM) have helped send Renaissance Capital's IPO-focused ETF (P:IPO) up nearly 30% for the year to date.
Jordan Stuart, a client portfolio manager at Federated Kaufmann who focuses on newly-public companies, said that any volatility around the 2020 presidential election could weigh on healthcare companies that have their stock market debuts next year, prompting some companies to go public by the end of this year instead. Healthcare is widely seen as the industry most likely affected by a Democratic victory in the presidential election.
Yet more companies are making the call that they have a ""window of liquidity"" through the end of this year, and are rushing at the chance to take it, Stuart said.
""These companies are looking for capital to grow and they're reasonably certain that they can get it now,"" he said.
The pushback on IPO valuations in the wake of the disappointing performance of hyped debuts from  Uber Technologies Inc  (N:UBER) and  Lyft  Inc (O:LYFT) is also putting pressure on companies to go public now because they do not expect to get a better deal in the future, said Kevin Landis, a portfolio manager at Firsthand Funds.
The We Company, for instance, could go public with a valuation as low as $18 billion, roughly a third of the $47 billion the company was valued at in a previous private funding round.

The annual poll by the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai found that while most of its member companies remained profitable in 2018, the number reporting revenue growth fell. Projections for future revenue also dropped, highlighting the corrosive impact of the escalating tit-for-tat tariffs.
Five-year optimism sunk for the first time since 2015, when China's stock markets nosedived and the authorities fumbled their response.
""Revenue growth projections have lowered, optimism about the future has waned, and many companies are redirecting investment originally planned for China,"" AmCham said in a report on the survey published on Wednesday.
The downbeat results come as U.S. and Chinese negotiators prepare to meet in Washington in October in stop-start efforts to de-escalate the year-long trade row. With little progress to show so far, market expectations for a breakthrough in the discussions are low.
""With no sign of a trade agreement, 2019 will be a difficult year; without a trade deal, 2020 may be worse,"" the AmCham report said.
Most AmCham member companies were against the use of tariffs to handle trade disputes, with three-quarters of respondents saying they were opposed.
The survey was conducted between June 27 and July 25 - before the latest round of tariff increases took effect - and received 333 responses, AmCham said.
Over a quarter of poll respondents said they had redirected investments originally planned for China to other locations – up 6.9 percentage points from the previous year. Southeast Asia was the top destination, followed by India.
Investment redirection was most prominent in technology, hardware, software and services, with 40% saying they had done so, according to the survey.
Moreover, decreases in investment have accelerated in 2019, underscoring the pressure on China's economy, which grew at its slowest pace in almost 30 years in the second quarter.
The survey showed a 14.4 percentage point fall in the number of companies anticipating increasing investment, and a 12.2 percentage point increase in the number of companies planning to decrease investment compared to 2018.
The gloom was taking a toll on employment.
Nearly 20% of companies said they were cutting headcount in 2019, compared to just shy of 10% last year, while the number of companies that said they were increasing headcount slipped by 17.8 percentage points.
Beside the trade war, the slowing Chinese economy clouded the outlook and was named as the greatest three- to five-year challenge by almost 60% of companies - up 22.5% from last year.
Still, AmCham said there were ""pockets of optimism"" in its survey results, with corruption and fraud reported to have declined, while government bureaucracy became more efficient and the regulatory environment improved."

Venezuela has suffered a severe economic and political crisis over the past several years, including wide-spread shortages of basic goods and soaring inflation, which has also caused debts owed to the airlines to pile up.
Due in large part to strict currency controls in place since 2003, the government of President Nicolas Maduro has for years failed to reimburse the airlines in hard currency for ticket sales in local currency.
""Right now, recovering this money is a lost cause,"" said Peter Cerda, IATA's regional vice president for the Americas, on the sidelines of the Aviation Day industry forum held in Panama City.
""We hope that in the future, when there's a change of administration, it allows us to have a dialogue about recovering that money,"" he added.
Cerda added that IATA, which represents some 240 airline companies, has not had any talks with Maduro's government in two years.
As Venezuela's economy has continued to shrink, airlines like Delta Air Lines Inc (N:DAL), Deutsche Lufthansa AG (DE:LHAG) and LATAM Airlines Group SA (SN:LTM) have cut their service to the South American country. Other carriers like  Air Canada  (TO:AC) and  American Airlines Group  Inc (O:AAL) stopped their flights in and out of Venezuela citing security concerns.
""There isn't much chance the companies will return... The government still owes the industry and until this is fixed it's difficult to expect any improvements,"" said Cerda.

353,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 10, 2019 06:35PM ET</span>","WeWork presses on with IPO, pushing SoftBank into a corner","By Anirban Sen and Joshua Franklin
(Reuters) - Office-sharing startup WeWork is pressing ahead with plans to go public despite lukewarm interest in its shares, three sources said, leaving its largest investor, SoftBank Group (T:9984), with a stark choice: take a haircut or pony up even more cash. 
The We Company, WeWork's parent, may seek a valuation as low as $15 billion to $18 billion in an initial public offering, down from the $47 billion value it commanded in the last private fundraising round in January, one source familiar with the situation said.
That means SoftBank, which has invested $10.65 billion in WeWork since 2017 through its Saudi-backed $100 billion Vision Fund and other vehicles, would have to write down the value of its investment should the IPO go ahead. 
Sources familiar with the situation cautioned that no final decisions have yet been made and the plans around valuation and timing of the IPO are all still subject to change.
The sources requested anonymity because the matter is private. SoftBank declined to comment. We Company also declined to comment. 
The sharply lower valuation reflects concerns around the sustainability of We Company's business model, which relies on a mix of long-term liabilities and short-term revenue, and how such a model would weather an economic downturn, according to investors and analysts. 
A sharp cut to WeWork's valuation would be a blow to SoftBank as at a time when it is seeking funds from investors for a second Vision Fund, for which it says $108 billion in pledges have been secured. 
Returns for SoftBank first Vision Fund have already been hit by lackluster listings of Uber (N:UBER) and Slack (N:WORK).
SoftBank chief Masayoshi Son and longtime lieutenant and group Vice Chairman Ron Fisher were in favor of the WeWork IPO until last week, even as others inside the group were pushing for a delay, one of the sources said. 
However, in recent days Son and Fisher have now conceded internally that a delay might be in SoftBank's best interests, the source added. 
Son and SoftBank have been pushing We Company Chief Executive Adam Neumann to delay the IPO but have so far failed to persuade him, according to two sources familiar with the matter. 
Having burned through $2.36 billion in cash in the first half of the year, WeWork requires a fresh injection of funds and is looking to raise between $3 billion and $4 billion in the IPO, Reuters has reported. 
Adding to the importance of We Company going public is the $6 billion in bank commitments it secured in August, which is dependent on it raising at least $3 billion from the IPO.
Given its need for cash, a postponement of the IPO would be feasible if SoftBank would inject more cash into WeWork, a proposition Son has so far been reluctant to pursue given how much the fund has already put in, according to two sources. 
For its part, WeWork may now wait until Monday of next week to begin its roadshow to pitch the IPO to investors given that it is still waiting on approval for its filing from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, according to one source familiar with the matter. 
The company had previously hoped to be in a position to begin its IPO roadshow as early as this week, Reuters has reported.
Reflecting the uncertainty in its IPO plans, We Company's $669 billion junk bond <96208LAA9=> issued last year fell below par on Tuesday for the first time since announcing its IPO plans about a month ago. The 7.875% note due in May 2025 was down 2.5 cents on the dollar and the yield surged by 55 basis points to the highest since mid-August.
INTUITIVE BETS 
While SoftBank and its Vision Fund emphasize their long-term investing credentials, founder and CEO Son has set out an ambitious IPO pipeline for tech investments spanning ride-hailing, fintech and health startups.
The tech conglomerate has burned through much of the $100 billion raised by its first Vision Fund in just two years, recording big paper gains on internal revaluations of its tech investments as well as the sale of marquee investments including India's Amazon Inc (O:AMZN) rival Flipkart. 
SoftBank says its valuation techniques include cash-flow analysis, recent transactions and comparison with peers to underpin its numbers, but Son has won a reputation for intuitive bets and for doubling down on companies which have yet to generate hard results.
SoftBank says many investments receive a vote of confidence as third parties come in as co-investors or by making follow-on investments at the same or higher valuations. 

If a tech company shelves an IPO due to a lower valuation than expected, investors are generally expected to take that fall into account when appraising their stakes.

Shares of Baker Hughes, in which GE owned an about 50.4% stake as of June 30, fell 3.7% to $23.20 in after hours trading, while GE's were marginally up at $9.15.
GE had long planned to sell down its stake in Baker Hughes.
But the issue came under scrutiny last month when Madoff whistleblower Harry Markopolos issued a lengthy report that alleged in part that GE was improperly counting Baker Hughes' income, capital and cash in GE's financial statements.
GE has said its accounting was appropriate since it is the majority shareholder.
Baker Hughes said GE would sell up to 120.75 million shares, including over-allotment option, of Baker Hughes' Class A common in a secondary offering. Baker Hughes will additionally repurchase $250 million of Class B common stock from GE in a private transaction.
GE currently owns about 522 million shares of Baker Hughes, and has said previously that a reduction in its ownership interest below 50% in Baker Hughes will result in GE 'deconsolidating' its oil and gas business.
GE's cash generation has failed to keep pace with earnings in recent years, causing the company to cut its dividend and divest non-core assets in order to raise billions of dollars in cash to meet its financial obligations.
Baker Hughes said the deal would also shrink the industrial conglomerate's presence on the oilfield services company's board to one seat from five.

General Electric wants John Rice to be its designated member on the Baker Hughes board, while Lorenzo Simonelli and Geoffrey Beattie are expected to continue as directors, but not as GE representatives.

355,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 10, 2019 06:09PM ET</span>",Not so fast: CDC isn't ready to blame illicit 'street vapes' for illnesses,"By Julie Steenhuysen
CHICAGO (Reuters) - U.S. health investigators are casting a wide net to understand what is sickening hundreds of vapers across the country and still have not ruled out any product on the market, even as vaping industry officials highlight the potential role of illegal cannabis products.
Dr Dana Meaney-Delman is leading the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's investigation into the culprit behind at least five confirmed deaths and 450 reported cases of lung illness linked with use of the devices. 
The agency is recommending that people refrain from the use of any electronic cigarette or vaping device until there is more conclusive evidence of a cause, she said in an interview.
    ""We're trying to prevent any additional cases and deaths,"" Meaney-Delman said. 
    She has reviewed data so far from 64 patients, including cases published on Friday in the New England Journal of Medicine as well as other reports. Eighty percent of those patients reported the use of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the psychoactive component of cannabis, she said. 
    On Friday, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration warned consumers against using vaping devices bought ""on the street"" or adding THC and other substances to products purchased in stores. E-cigarette manufacturers have distanced themselves from illicit ""street vapes"" and stressed that their products don't contain the liquids under scrutiny.     
""We agree with the FDA. If you don't want to die or end up in a hospital, stop vaping illegal THC oils immediately,"" said Gregory Conley, president of the American Vaping Association.
Meaney-Delman said investigators are not yet ready to distinguish between products. The data she has reviewed show that 60 percent of patients used both THC and nicotine, while 20 percent reported only using nicotine in their devices.
    ""We're absolutely concerned about THC, but there's a large number in our data that are reporting (use of) both nicotine and THC,"" Meaney-Delman said. ""There is no one product, device or substance that we can point to that is common among all these different patients.""
    
DOCTORS WEIGH IN
The CDC's view has been reinforced by the American Medical Association, which on Monday urged consumers to stop using any sort of electronic cigarette until the investigation yields clear findings. The AMA called on doctors to inform patients about the potential dangers of the devices, including toxins and carcinogens.
An FDA spokesman said on Tuesday the agency has not changed its recommendation to consumers. The FDA has faced mounting pressure to curb a surge in teenage use of e-cigarette products. Last year the number of high school students using e-cigarettes shot up by 78 percent, a trend that coincided with the rising popularity of Juul e-cigarettes. Juul is 35 percent-owned by  Altria Group  (N:MO).
Former FDA Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb on Monday called for government regulation of cannabis products in an interview on CNBC, noting the possible THC link to the illnesses.
Meaney-Delman said state health officials are now going back to interview all patients about the products they used. 
The CDC is also trying to match what its scientists are finding in tissue and fluid samples taken from patients' lungs with substances the FDA is identifying in the products used by sick patients. Meaney-Delman said some of the samples are nicotine products and some are THC products from a variety of places.
    In the meantime, the agency is instructing doctors to start asking patients about their vaping history and urging patients who vape to monitor themselves and seek medical attention for symptoms of cough, shortness of breath, chest pain, nausea and vomiting.  
Meaney-Delman said the publication of chest X-rays and CT scans from affected patients in the New England Journal of Medicine should help doctors identify additional cases. 

    ""That's helpful so physicians can look at the imaging, which has been really important to these diagnoses, and compare patients they have in front of them,"" she said.

CUPERTINO, Calif. (Reuters) - Apple Inc (O:AAPL) caught up with hardware rivals on Tuesday by revealing a triple-camera iPhone, and it rolled out a streaming TV service priced at $5 a month, undercutting  Disney  and Netflix.
The announcements came at the company's biggest marketing event, where it unveils its top products for the year ahead, and showcased an aggressive Apple ready to battle on price.
The long-awaited Apple TV+ streaming television service will be available in over 100 countries, starting in November.
Buyers of an iPhone, iPad or Mac will get a free year of streaming TV, potentially drawing hundreds of millions of viewers to the service. That catapults the new service into a rarified group of companies.
""I think the pricing on the Apple TV service was definitely a positive surprise,"" said Michael James, managing director of equity trading at Wedbush Securities in Los Angeles. ""That's why you're seeing the hammering in some of the other video service-related names like Netflix, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Roku. Clearly, that was a positive that people were happy to hear.""
There was no bundle with Apple Music or other services as some analysts had expected. But Ben Bajarin, an analyst with Creative Strategies, said the TV service, a $5 a month ""Arcade"" gaming service and the base model iPhone 11, seem designed to draw in users for the longer term.
""We weren't expecting Apple Arcade and particularly Apple TV to be priced as aggressively as they were,"" Bajarin said. ""They know once consumers get into their ecosystem, they don't leave.""
Apple said its new iPhone 11 will come with two back cameras, including an ultra wide-angle lens and the next generation of microchips, the A13. Prices start at $699, down from last year's new iPhone that started at $749.
The more expensive iPhone 11 Pro will have three cameras on the back - wide angle, telephoto and ultra-wide. It can create videos with all three back cameras and the front camera at the same time and starts at $999. The iPhone 11 Pro Max with a bigger screen starts at $1,099. The new phones are available to order Friday and will start shipping Sept. 20.
Rivals including Huawei Technologies Co Ltd [HWT.UL] and  Samsung Electronics Co Ltd  (KS:005930) already sell phones with three cameras on the back. While Apple once tested the upper limits of what consumers would pay for a phone, it is now giving ground on prices, even making older models available at significant discounts to the latest technology.
""Consumers absolutely still care about cameras. That's why it was surprising over the last couple of years that Samsung and Huawei got the jump on Apple,"" said Patrick Moorhead, an analyst with Moor Insights & Strategy. ""Apple was playing a bit of catch up, but Apple did bring their game, particularly on the video side of the camera, where I do think they'll have the leg up.""
Analysts expect Apple will sell around 200 million iPhones in the next year, in addition to other devices, and while many of those will be in China, it ensures at least tens of millions of potential viewers for the subscription service.
Hal Eddins, chief economist for Apple shareholder Capital Investment Counsel, said Apple's lower priced iPhones ""aren't exciting on the surface, but the low streaming price may suck in some new subscribers."" Apple shares gained 0.8%.
CROWDED FIELD
With streaming content, Apple is entering a crowded field dominated by Netflix Inc (O:NFLX). (Graphic: https://tmsnrt.rs/2N6OB2j)
Walt Disney Co (N:DIS) will launch on Nov. 12 a $7-per-month service that will contain that firm's iconic children's content. Apple is also trying to win out over HBO Max with its hit shows like ""Game of Thrones,"" ""Friends"" and ""The Sopranos.""
Apple's challenge is to persuade consumers that its family of devices, from its set-top box to phones, are the best one-stop place to watch shows.
“The roll out of new subscription-based services by Apple paves the way for the introduction of new business models akin to the all-you-can-eat bundles like Amazon Prime,"" said Paolo Pescatore, analyst with PP Foresight. ""In the future we might even see users pay for a service bundle and receive a new iPhone every year.”
Apple also unveiled an updated watch, the Series 5, with an always-on display, starting at $399, while keeping the older Series 3 starting at $199. Moorhead said the older model would drive ""tremendous"" business.
Apple said the seventh generation of the iPad will start at $329 and be available to order starting Tuesday and in stores on Sept. 30."

(Reuters) - PG&E Corp's plan to cap payments to victims of California wildfires blamed on the power producer is ""totally unacceptable,"" a lawyer representing victims in the utility's bankruptcy case said on Tuesday.
San Francisco-based PG&E unveiled on Monday a proposed plan to exit bankruptcy that included payments capped at $8.4 billion for wildfire claims.
The plan forces fire victims and government entities to seek compensation from the same fund, which will dilute payouts for everyone, said Cecily Dumas, a BakerHostetler lawyer who represents the official committee of tort claimants in PG&E's bankruptcy.
State investigators have blamed PG&E transmission lines with causing wildfires in 2017 and 2018 including the Camp Fire that killed 85 people.
Dumas said that government agencies such as the Department of the Interior and the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA, could have billions of dollars in claims, leaving far less for victims than $8.4 billion.
At the same time, PG&E said it intends to pay other unsecured creditors such as noteholders in full in cash when its plan goes into effect next year. ""That's unfair,"" said Dumas.
A PG&E spokeswoman said the plan meets the company's legal requirements and ""proposes a rate-neutral framework that fairly compensates wildfire victims and other stakeholders.""
The plan must be approved by U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Dennis Montali in San Francisco, and companies in Chapter 11 generally seek broad support from creditors.
Montali had referred the process for estimating what PG&E owes for property loss, personal injury and wrongful death claims to U.S. District Court Judge James Donato in San Francisco. Donato said on Tuesday he expected to resolve the estimated compensation in January.
PG&E also capped payments at $8.5 billion for reimbursing insurers that had paid victims and at $1 billion for local governments. 
PG&E said it would raise $14 billion by selling stock, and had commitments from funds led by Knighthead Capital Management to invest $1.5 billion. The company said large banks expressed confidence that $30 billion could be raised in both debt and equity.
Shares of PG&E ended down 2.6% on Tuesday at $10.90. 
Dumas said the plan also violates the so-called absolute priority rule, which requires that creditors get paid in full before shareholders receive anything. 

She said the court should allow wildfire victims to opt for a $30 billion plan by proposed by bondholders led by Elliott Management, which included $16 billion for all PG&E's pre-bankruptcy wildfire claims.

FEMA’s Regional Administrator Ahsha Tribble, her former deputy, Jovanda Patterson, and Cobra’s former president Donald Keith Ellison were arrested and face a 15-count indictment alleging crimes including conspiracy to bribe public officials, false statements and fraud.
The trio “used Tribble’s position to benefit and illegally enrich themselves,” Rodriguez-Velez told reporters in San Juan on Tuesday.
“These defendants were supposed to come to Puerto Rico to help during the recovery after the devastation suffered from Hurricane Maria,” she said in an emailed statement. “Instead, they decided to take advantage of the precarious conditions of our electric power grid.”
Hurricane Maria struck in September 2017, and federal aid was slow to arrive. Hundreds of thousands of Puerto Ricans waited for months without electricity after the storm, and at least 3,000 people died. The delay occurred at the same time the trio were allegedly conspiring. The arrest of federal officials charged with overseeing the relief effort comes after President Donald Trump’s repeated criticism of alleged corruption by Puerto Rican politicians.
While Trump has claimed that Puerto Rico has received $91 billion in aid, U.S. lawmakers have allocated about $42.5 billion in disaster aid so far, and about $14 billion had been spent on the island, according to federal data.
The storm hit just a few months after the commonwealth filed a record $74 billion bankruptcy following a more than decade-long recession. Public services had already been hollowed out by budget cuts. On Tuesday, Rodriguez-Velez described the alleged offenses as “reprehensible, more so in light of PREPA’s and Puerto Rico’s fiscal crisis.”
The Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority, the territory’s government-owned power company gave two contracts totaling $1.8 billion to Cobra to help repair the island’s power grid in the aftermath of the storm. Rodriguez-Velez outlined what she said were gifts Ellison had doled out to Tribble, including airline tickets and use of a personal helicopter, in exchange for information that allegedly helped Cobra secure the contracts and Tribble’s influencing of FEMA and PREPA officials. Patterson left her job at FEMA last year to go to work for Cobra.
“Corruption in the ranks of the DHS and FEMA will not be tolerated,” said James Long, special agent in charge of the major frauds and corruption unit.
Tribble was assigned to work in Puerto Rico as part of FEMA’s response to Hurricane Maria and served as the chief official in charge of power and infrastructure from October 2017 to September 2018, a period during which millions of Puerto Ricans went without power.
“Mammoth is aware of and has been cooperating with the government’s investigation into Ms. Tribble and Mr. Ellison and will continue to do so,” Peter Mirijanian, a Mammoth spokesperson, said in an emailed statement.
FEMA spokesperson Alex Bruner said the agency can’t comment on personnel matters, but is “fully cooperating” with the federal investigators.
“There is a serious corruption problem that goes beyond the island,” said Miguel Angel Rosario Lozada, a historian at National University College in Puerto Rico. “They arrested federal officials who orchestrated a corruption scheme that affected the lives of thousands of Puerto Ricans.”"

JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co. reduced the annual net interest income target it set two months ago, joining  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C). and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co. in lowering the bar this week. Longer-term rates have continued to fall as investors expect the Federal Reserve to continue the cuts it began in July.
JPMorgan’s net interest income will likely be around $57 billion this year, Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said Tuesday at an investor conference in New York. That’s down from the $57.5 billion it targeted in July, which was a $500 million cut from what it expected in April.
Banks’ traditional lending businesses have profited from the Fed’s march upward that began in late 2015, as they passed on the higher rates to borrowers while keeping deposit rates low. Investors have fretted about how banks will handle the turnabout, causing their stocks to trail the broader market despite record earnings and buybacks.
The four commercial banking giants all missed analysts’ estimates for net interest income in the second quarter, and most set a lower bar for the latter half of 2019.
Wells Fargo Chief Financial Officer John Shrewsberry said Monday that NII will likely drop 6% from last year, the second time this year it’s cut that outlook. Citigroup CFO Mark Mason said his bank will probably see a 3% to 4% increase in NII this year, down from earlier guidance of 4%.
Not all lenders had bad news on lending income.  State Street  Corp (NYSE:STT). surged as much as 7.5%, the most since July, after saying net interest income probably won’t fall in the third quarter even as lower interest rates pressure revenue."

366,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 10, 2019 03:02PM ET</span>","Apple reveals triple-camera iPhone, undercuts Disney streaming TV price","By Stephen Nellis and Noel Randewich
CUPERTINO, Calif. (Reuters) - Apple Inc (O:AAPL) revealed on Tuesday that its streaming TV service will kick off Nov. 1 and cost $4.99 a month and new cameras for the latest iPhones, as the tech giant reaches a turning point where it focuses as much on services as its hardware and software.
Apple TV+ will be available in over 100 countries and buyers of an iPhone, iPad or Mac will get a free year of streaming television service, the company announced.
Apple revealed that its new iPhone 11 will come with two back cameras, including an ultra wide-angle lens and the next generation of microchips, the A13, but few big apparent changes. Prices start at $699.
The iPhone 11 Pro will have three cameras on the back - wide angle, telephoto and ultra-wide. It can create videos with all three back cameras and the front camera at the same time and starts at $999. The iPhone 11 Pro Max with a bigger screen starts at $1,099. The new phones are available to order Friday and will start shipping Sept. 20.
Apple is in a ""holding pattern"" until it rolls out 5G phones with faster mobile data speeds next year, analysts said. Instead, services like the television content featuring the likes of Oprah Winfrey that will compete with Netflix Inc (O:NFLX) and Walt  Disney  Co (N:DIS) could take center stage.
Apple long boasted about its competitive advantage over rivals such as  Samsung Electronics Co Ltd  (KS:005930), which makes handsets, or Alphabet Inc's Google (O:GOOGL), which provides the Android operating system for most of the world's phones. Apple touted controlling both the hardware and software, resulting in polished products that commanded premium prices and captured most of the smart phone industry's profits.
At the fall event in the Steve Jobs Theater in Cupertino, California - typically Apple's splashiest and dedicated to its flagship devices - Apple is cementing a third element to its focus: hardware, software and services.
The new strategy comes as iPhone sales have declined year-over-year for the past two fiscal quarters and investors are fixed on the growth potential for services.
Apple also announced its video game service, Apple Arcade, will be a tab in the App Store and available starting Sept. 19 and cost $4.99 a month, with a one-month free trial.
""This is the first time we'll get to see Apple's strategy with all three parts of the business,"" said Ben Bajarin, an analyst with Creative Strategies.
With streaming content, Apple is entering a crowded field. Since Apple's initial television event in March, rivals like Walt Disney Co (N:DIS) have since announced a $6.99 per month service that will contain that firm's iconic children's content.
With no historic library of television content of its own, Apple will sell its own service - Apple TV+ - even as it already serves as a reseller of other channels like HBO and, analysts believe, takes a cut of sales. Bajarin said Apple's challenge is to persuade consumers that its family of devices, from its set-top box to phones, are the best one-stop place to watch shows, despite the fact that Netflix has yet to come on board with the integrated viewing system. (Netflix remains available as a standalone app on Apple devices, and its shows appear in search results in the Apple TV app.)
""Netflix is sort of gaping void"" in the Apple TV app ""but they've got Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and all the channels on board,"" Bajarin said. ""The vast majority of content providers are playing nice with Apple TV.""
Apple also unveiled updates to the Apple Watch and iPad.
The Apple Watch Series 5 will have an always-on display, an 18-hour battery life and international emergency calling in over 150 countries. Prices start at $399 or $499 with cellular service and will be available to order Tuesday and in stores Sept. 20. The Series 3 Apple Watch will start at $199.
Apple said the seventh generation of the iPad will start at $329 and be available to order starting Tuesday and in stores on Sept. 30.
""I believe we are in an incremental holding pattern until 5G. Customers with iPhone X and beyond likely won't have a reason to upgrade,"" said Patrick Moorhead of Moor Insights & Strategy.
Apple makes much of its profits on selling memory upgrades to devices with larger storage capacity, and Moorhead said falling memory chip prices could help Apple absorb the cost of tariffs on Chinese-made goods, which are expected to hit mobile phones starting Dec. 15.
""Thankfully, storage and memory prices have declined so instead of taking more profit, I see Apple eating the cost and not raising prices,"" Moorhead said. ""I can also see Apple leaning heavily on its supply chain to eat some of the cost."""
367,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 10, 2019 03:01PM ET</span>",Trump Ousts Bolton After Dispute Over Negotiating With Taliban,"(Bloomberg) -- President Donald Trump said he fired his hawkish national security adviser, John Bolton, after disagreeing “strongly” with many of his positions, ending a tumultuous tenure marked by multiple setbacks in U.S. foreign policy.
Bolton, known for his hardline approach to U.S. adversaries including Iran, North Korea and Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, was the third person to formally occupy the White House’s highest-ranking national security job under Trump.
“I informed John Bolton last night that his services are no longer needed at the White House,” Trump said in a pair of tweets. “I thank John very much for his service. I will be naming a new National Security Advisor next week.”
Bolton had been scheduled to take part in a White House press briefing Tuesday on terrorism. Minutes after Trump’s announcement, Bolton contradicted the president on Twitter, saying that he had offered to resign Monday night and Trump deferred the discussion.
Trump and Bolton had disagreed on “many, many issues,” White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham said. Most recently, Bolton had advised the president against a meeting he had planned with the Taliban at Camp David to complete negotiations to end the war in Afghanistan. Bolton was also skeptical of Trump’s overtures to Kim Jong Un. He was conspicuously absent in June when Trump made a snap decision to meet the North Korean leader at the Demilitarized Zone; Bolton instead traveled to Mongolia to meet with officials there.
Bolton’s departure is a boon for Secretary of State Michael Pompeo, who had clashed with the national security adviser and now assumes an unchallenged role as Trump’s closest adviser on foreign policy. Charlie Kupperman, the deputy national security adviser, will assume Bolton’s position on an acting basis, deputy White House press secretary Hogan Gidley said.
Kupperman is a Bolton confidant who has counseled the former national security adviser for more than 30 years, Bolton has said. Grisham said it was “too soon to say” whether Bolton’s National Security Council staff would remain in their jobs.
Foreign Setbacks
Gidley said in an interview on Fox News after Trump’s announcement that it had become “very clear that John Bolton’s policies and priorities did not align with President Trump’s.”
The break came days after Trump abandoned his plan to meet with the Taliban at Camp David, capping a tough week. On Friday, the president’s adviser on North Korea said negotiations have been stalled for months. On Thursday, Middle East envoy Jason Greenblatt announced his intention to depart; the vaunted Israeli-Palestinian peace plan he’s been working on has yet to be unveiled. The U.S.-China trade war drags on.
Crude oil futures reversed an earlier gain in New York, falling 0.2% to $57.71 a barrel at 12:06 p.m.
Bolton, 70, joined the White House in April 2018, bringing an interventionist view into Trump’s inner circle.
From the outset, Bolton seemed like an odd fit for a president who champions an “America First” agenda and campaigned on disengaging the U.S. from wars prosecuted by his predecessors. At times, Bolton pursued his own longstanding foreign policy priorities, creating tension with top administration officials and the president himself.
Bolton came to the post best known for his ardent support of the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq while serving in the George W. Bush administration. He was later a Fox News contributor and senior fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute.
Since joining Trump’s White House, Bolton sought to break Iran financially, shield Americans from the reach of the International Criminal Court and toughen U.S. posture toward Russia. Bolton was a leading voice promoting U.S. support for the ouster of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, an effort that hasn’t been successful.
‘Naive Worldview’
Bolton’s departure drew mixed reactions from Republican lawmakers.
Senator Mitt Romney, the Utah Republican, said it was a “huge loss” for the administration. Bolton’s “point of view is not always the same as everyone else in the room. That’s why you want him there,” Romney said.
Senator Rand Paul, the Kentucky Republican, said the threat of war “goes down exponentially with John Bolton out of the White House.”
“I think his advocacy for regime change around the world is a naïve worldview and I think the world will be a much better place with a new adviser,” Paul said.
Weeks before joining the administration, Bolton wrote a Wall Street Journal op-ed arguing for a preemptive strike against North Korea, only for Trump to instead pursue diplomacy with Kim. Bolton said that his personal views were “now behind me” and that “the important thing is what the president says and what advice I give him.”
Kelly Conflict
Bolton also took a hard line on immigration policy, and clashed with former White House Chief of Staff John Kelly over the administration’s approach to border crossings.
Last year, Kelly and Bolton engaged in a heated argument outside the Oval Office over immigration and the performance of then-Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen. Bolton was among the officials who urged Trump to fire Nielsen.
Bolton, whom the president sometimes called “the Mustache” because of his trademark facial hair, clashed with Pompeo and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin over sanctions against Iran. Bolton has argued that waivers for the sanctions were too generous toward Iran.
Bolton had been scheduled to brief reporters at the White House with Mnuchin and Pompeo on Tuesday.
Bolton suffered the loss of his top deputy, Mira Ricardel, in November after first lady Melania Trump called for her ouster. Melania Trump issued an unusual public statement demanding Ricardel leave the White House after clashes between Bolton’s deputy and the first lady’s staff over her trip to Africa last year.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) lowered its outlook for 2019 net interest income by about $500 million on Tuesday, following similar moves by rival big banks  Wells Fargo  & Co (N:WFC) and  Citigroup  Inc (N:C).
""Our (net interest income) will be a little bit lower than we told you last time,"" Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said at Barclays' Financial Services Conference in New York. ""I think we told you $57.5 (billion) and I'm closer to $57 (billion) for this year.""
That is a lower forecast for full-year net interest income than the bank gave in mid-July and it shows that banks with large pools of customer deposits are struggling to make as much money amid lower interest rates and an inverted yield curve.
On Monday, top brass from Citi and Wells Fargo tempered their outlooks for net interest income. 
Citi now expects net interest income to be up 3% to 4% for the year, compared with prior guidance of 4% growth.
Wells Fargo lowered its projections for the second time this year. The bank's chief financial officer said it expects net interest income to fall 6% in 2019, compared with 5% stated previously.

Dimon also said JPMorgan Chase expects third-quarter trading revenues to be 10% lower than in the second quarter, while fees from mergers and acquisitions will likely be flat in comparison with the prior quarter.

During a four hour celebration in an 80,000-capacity stadium, Alibaba's billionaire executive chairman delivered on his promise of a year ago to hand over to CEO Daniel Zhang.
Costumed performers, some dancing to dubstep music and dressed in traditional Chinese dress, and singers paid tribute to Ma's reputation for dressing up and performing at big events, entering to a parade of floats representing Alibaba divisions such as shopping site Tmall and payment service Ant Financial. 
""After tonight I will start a new life. I do believe the world is good, there are so many opportunities, and I love excitement so much, which is why I will retire early,"" Ma told guests and employees.
Ma was spotted at one point welling up with tears as staff put on skits and sang songs, prompting the topic ""Jack Ma has cried"" to trend on Chinese social media platform Weibo. 
Toward the end of the ceremony, Ma, co-founder Lucy Peng, and CEO of Alibaba's technology committee Wang Juan donned rock star-style leather jackets and wigs to perform Chinese pop songs. They were joined by co-founder Joe Tsai dressed in Marilyn Monroe style white dress and a blonde wig. 
Zhang, also clad in rock star garb, then delivered a solo, having earlier said that Alibaba would keep investing in areas such as cloud computing.
Ma's exit comes as Alibaba has grown to become Asia's most valuable listed company, with a market capitalization of $460 billion. It employs over 100,000 people, and has expanded into financial services, cloud computing and artificial intelligence.
The company also said on Tuesday that it had adopted six new core values, among which one was a pledge to ""respect the work-life balance decisions of every individual"", marking a step away from Ma's recent comments urging tech company employees to work nights and weekends, which sparked a nationwide debate. 
Ma also told attendees that he hoped to see Alibaba shoulder more responsibility to improve society amid the sweeping changes brought about by technologies like big data and 5G. 

""It is not easy to be a strong company, but it is more difficult to be a good company,"" he said. ""A strong company is determined by its commercial ability, while a good company is responsible and kind.""

373,By Investing.com,"<span>Sep 10, 2019 01:23PM ET</span>",StockBeat: Boeing Climbs Despite Nosedive in Deliveries,"Investing.com - Boeing (NYSE:BA) climbed on Tuesday despite the aircraft maker delivering fewer-than-expected jets last month as the grounding of its 737 MAX jet continues to keep a lid on growth. 
Boeing (NYSE:BA) delivered 276 planes through August, down 42% from the 481 jets delivered in the first eight months of last year, undershooting analyst forecasts for about 500 deliveries during the period in 2019. Boeing shares were up 2.1% and contributed more than 50 points to the Dow Jones industrials.
Weakness among other Dow components, especially McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD), pulled the blue-chip index lower.
The slump in Boeing (NYSE:BA) deliveries comes as the company did not deliver any 737 MAX aircraft, which have been grounded worldwide for nearly six months after two fatal crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia.
Boeing has estimated that its 737 MAX jets could be back in the air by October, but the aircraft maker may find it difficult to build traction as some regulators said they would carry out independent checks to validate the FAA's final verdict on improvements made to the jets. 
The European Aviation Safety Agency said it plans to send its own pilots to the U.S. to carry out flight tests of the jets. 
The checks from other regulators, however, could restore public faith in the jets, but will likely delay the entry to service. 
European rival Airbus, meanwhile, continues to bolster its pipeline, with combined deliveries of 500 aircraft for the first eight months of 2019. 
Boeing is up more than 13% for the year so far, after bouncing from a low of around $320 last month. It had been up as much as 38% before the 737 Max groundings."

375,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 10, 2019 01:06PM ET</span>",Apple to reveal streaming service prices while iPhones in 'holding pattern' until 5G,"By Stephen Nellis and Noel Randewich
CUPERTINO, Calif. (Reuters) - Apple Inc (O:AAPL) kicked off Tuesday its presentation where it is expected to announce pricing for its forthcoming streaming TV service as well as updates to its iPhone lineup, as the tech giant reaches a turning point where it focuses as much on services as its hardware and software.
The annual upgrade to the iPhone is expected to include new camera features but few big changes, with Apple in a ""holding pattern"" until it rolls out 5G phones with faster mobile data speeds next year, analysts said. Instead, services like the television content featuring the likes of Oprah Winfrey that will compete with Netflix Inc (O:NFLX) and Walt  Disney  Co (N:DIS) could take center stage.
While the iPhone still makes up more than half of Apple's sales, Tuesday's event may nudge it off center stage after a decade in the limelight.
Apple long boasted about its competitive advantage over rivals such as  Samsung Electronics Co Ltd  (KS:005930), which makes handsets, or Alphabet Inc's Google (O:GOOGL), which provides the Android operating system for most of the world's phones. Apple touted controlling both the hardware and software, resulting in polished products that commanded premium prices and captured most of the smart phone industry's profits.
At the fall event in the Steve Jobs Theater in Cupertino, California - typically Apple's splashiest and dedicated to its flagship devices - Apple is cementing a third element to its focus: hardware, software and services.
The new strategy, which Apple hinted at an event in March where it gave some details about the streaming TV service, comes as iPhone sales have declined year-over-year for the past two fiscal quarters and investors are fixed on the growth potential for services.
Questions about how Apple will price its television service, and whether it will bundle it with its streaming music products, will weigh on the minds of Wall Street and analysts just as much as whether the Apple TV hardware box gets an upgrade or how many cameras the iPhone has. Apple has not yet given a specific launch date or price.
""This is the first time we'll get to see Apple's strategy with all three parts of the business,"" said Ben Bajarin, an analyst with Creative Strategies.
With streaming content, Apple is entering a crowded field. Since Apple's initial television event in March, rivals like Walt Disney Co (N:DIS) have since announced a $6.99 per month service that will contain that firm's iconic children's content.
With no historic library of television content of its own, Apple will sell its own service - Apple TV+ - even as it already serves as a reseller of other channels like HBO and, analysts believe, takes a cut of sales. Bajarin said Apple's challenge is to persuade consumers that its family of devices, from its set-top box to phones, are the best one-stop place to watch shows, despite the fact that Netflix has yet to come on board with the integrated viewing system. (Netflix remains available as a standalone app on Apple devices, and its shows appear in search results in the Apple TV app.)
""Netflix is sort of gaping void"" in the Apple TV app ""but they've got Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and all the channels on board,"" Bajarin said. ""The vast majority of content providers are playing nice with Apple TV.""
Apple is also likely to unveil updates to the iPhone and Apple Watch. Analysts expect the iPhone to feature better cameras, and perhaps new chips to help handle the work of sensors on the device, but few new blockbuster features. Those are not expected until next year, when Apple is expected to have a 5G device capable to taking advantage of faster mobile data networks.
""I believe we are in an incremental holding pattern until 5G. Customers with iPhone X and beyond likely won't have a reason to upgrade,"" said Patrick Moorhead of Moor Insights & Strategy.
In terms of pricing, most analyst expect prices to remain unchanged from the last year's models, between $749 and $1,099 depending on size and features. Apple makes much of its profits on selling memory upgrades to devices with larger storage capacity, and Moorhead said falling memory chip prices could help Apple absorb the cost of tariffs on Chinese-made goods, which are expected to hit mobile phones starting Dec. 15.
""Thankfully, storage and memory prices have declined so instead of taking more profit, I see Apple eating the cost and not raising prices,"" Moorhead said. ""I can also see Apple leaning heavily on its supply chain to eat some of the cost."""

382,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 10, 2019 11:54AM ET</span>","Recovery first: for next Nissan CEO, priority is profit before Renault partnership","By Naomi Tajitsu
TOKYO (Reuters) - The next head of Nissan Motor Co will need to prioritize a recovery in profits at the troubled Japanese firm ahead of trying to fix its relationship with top shareholder  Renault  SA (PA:RENA), executives and analysts say.
Reviving earnings would strengthen the carmaker's hand in negotiations with its French partner, and is something Renault itself would welcome as the owner of a 43.4% stake in Nissan. 
Japan's second-largest automaker said on Monday CEO Hiroto Saikawa would step down on Sept. 16 after he admitted to being overpaid in breach of company rules.
It's another heavy blow for Nissan, which is already reeling from the arrest of former chairman Carlos Ghosn last year and a subsequent plunge in earnings. Its stock is down 20% this year.
For Saikawa's yet-to-be-named replacement, the top priority will be lifting profits from a more than decade low. Earnings have been undercut by years of heavy discounts and low-margin sales to rental firms that have cheapened Nissan's brand image.
Renault, which has unsuccessfully sought a full-blown merger with its larger partner, is likely to give the Japanese firm time to focus on its turnaround, a Nissan executive said.
""It goes without saying recovery is the biggest priority,"" the executive said, declining to be identified because the information is not public.
""We have Renault's understanding on that.""
Tensions in the Nissan-Renault partnership worsened after Ghosn's arrest. He is awaiting trial in Tokyo on financial misconduct charges that he denies. 
The strain has sparked investor concern about the future of the Franco-Japanese automaking alliance at a time when car companies desperately need scale to keep up with sweeping technological changes like electric vehicles and ride-hailing.
Nissan executives have long complained about their unequal partnership with Renault, which saved the Japanese firm from bankruptcy in 1999. Nissan holds a 15% stake in Renault, but without voting rights. Tokyo is also seen as being uneasy about the French government's 15% holding in Renault, which makes Paris an indirect shareholder in Nissan.
""Profitability is likely to remain under pressure and it (Nissan) is unlikely to promptly reach an agreement with Renault over the future shape of the alliance,"" analysts at Standard & Poor's said in a note.
BOTTOM LINE
Tensions worsened when Renault tried to in vain to merge with Nissan and then Fiat Chrysler. Both Renault Chairman Jean-Dominique Senard and the French government may now have to hold off on their expressed desire for stronger ties with Nissan.
""It's also in the French government's interest for Nissan to improve its bottom line,"" Janet Lewis, head of Asia transportation research at Macquarie Securities.
""Renault's share price is going to benefit much more from a healthy Nissan than any kind of merger agreement.""
COO Yasuhiro Yamauchi will take over from Saikawa next week on an interim basis as a newly created nominations committee will recommend a successor by the end of October. Possible candidates include Nissan veteran Jun Seki, and Makoto Uchida, who currently head's the automaker's China operations.
Two key tasks for the new CEO will be to see through Nissan's recovery strategy in the United States, where it is trying to stop flooding the market with discounted cars, and execute plans announced by Saikawa in July to cut excess production at its global plants.
Saikawa on Monday suggested that his plan to improve U.S. profit by producing higher-quality cars while weaning dealers off of sales incentives was already paying off, and that signs of recovery would be evident at first-half results next month. 
The new CEO will also oversee a cut of around one-tenth of Nissan's global workforce - its deepest job cuts since 2009 - and slash production capacity, shuttering underutilized plants built as part of Ghosn's aggressive growth strategy in 2011 to grab 8% global market share.
While steep, the challenges facing Nissan now are different from 1999, said Macquarie's Lewis, referring to the time when Renault rescued the automaker from the brink bankruptcy and dispatched Ghosn to overhaul the Japanese company.
""Nissan has a very strong balance sheet, it has a very profitable business in China. They have some problems in the U.S. but they're not insurmountable,"" she said.

""This is not a 1999 situation where Nissan needs to be rescued.""

383,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 10, 2019 11:52AM ET</span>",Goldman Chiefs Court Saudis on Aramco IPO After 1MDB Fallout,"(Bloomberg) --  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). is tapping its upper echelons to navigate a notoriously complicated region where it has stumbled of late: the Middle East.
After missing out on at least $25 billion in deals in Abu Dhabi -- the emirate that snubbed the U.S. bank for its involvement in the 1MDB scandal -- Goldman Sachs is making a push into Saudi Arabia.
Chief Executive Officer David Solomon -- the first chief of a Wall Street bank to visit the kingdom following the murder of government critic Jamal Khashoggi -- has turned to international banking head Richard Gnodde and former Donald Trump adviser Dina Powell to help lead the push. They’ve all spent months wooing top officials in Riyadh, vying for a slice of the world’s biggest initial public offering, people with knowledge of the matter said.
The charm offensive is paying off: the bank has been picked for a lead role on Saudi Aramco’s mammoth offering, according to people with knowledge of the matter. The deal promises to open the door to more lucrative mandates as the nation opens up to foreign investment and plans to privatize hundreds of state assets.
Saudi Arabia is becoming the focus of Goldman Sachs’ Middle East strategy after the fallout from the 1MDB corruption scandal marked its abrupt downfall in Abu Dhabi, once one of its most lucrative markets in the region. Dealings with Qatar have become more complicated amid its diplomatic clashes with the kingdom. Global banks, including JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) & Co. and  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Group AG, are investing in Saudi Arabia as it promises some of the world’s biggest deals.
“Saudi Arabia is a goldmine of potential investment banking revenues for Goldman Sachs in the Middle East,” said Gary Dugan, chief executive officer of Singapore-based Purple Asset Management Pte. “They will need success on Aramco to offset the door closing in their face in Abu Dhabi.”
A spokesman for Goldman Sachs declined to comment.
Goldman Sachs had been the go-to bank for many of Abu Dhabi’s top dealmakers, but has missed out on billions of dollars of deals after being sued by two of its investment funds. The bank is accused of misleading investors when it helped 1MDB raise $6.5 billion through bond deals in 2012 and 2013, while allegedly knowing that the funds would be misappropriated. The firm has denied culpability in the scandal and laid the blame on Tim Leissner, a former partner who has pleaded guilty.
‘1MDB Controversy’
Mubadala Investment Co. publicly blacklisted the bank earlier this year, while a number of local lenders and state bodies have informally stopped doing business with the bank, people with knowledge have said.
“The 1MDB controversy has shaken Goldman severely,” said David Knutson, head of credit research for the Americas at Schroder Investment Management in New York. “The question is do they hunker down, go back into their shell and pause until they are confident they’ve reinstituted the culture that made Goldman what it was, or are they confident enough in the changes they have made to go back after something that is complex, challenging and potentially risky not unlike what they faced in Malaysia?”
Goldman Sachs is being sidelined as Abu Dhabi, home to 6% of global oil reserves, is in the midst of a consolidation wave as the emirate tackles lower oil prices and slowing economic growth. The government is merging banks and sovereign funds, selling non-core assets and bringing in international investors into core sectors such as oil and gas -- all of which mean big business for banks.
The U.S. bank advised on the initial public offering of Abu Dhabi National Oil Co.’s retail distribution unit in 2017 that raised $851 million and worked with Mubadala on the planned $3 billion IPO of its Emirates Global Aluminium unit. It was also involved in a controversial deal to raise $1.2 billion in bonds for a cluster of airlines linked to Etihad Airways.
Despite the fallout, Goldman Sachs continues to speak with companies in Abu Dhabi and seek new business there, one of the people said.
In Saudi Arabia, Goldman Sachs’s top executives have been cultivating relationships for years.
While the bank joined rivals in canceling its attendance at the nation’s marquee conference last year, CEO Solomon in April became the first head of a global U.S. bank to travel to the kingdom to boost ties after Khashoggi’s killing and dismemberment at a consulate in Istanbul.
Investment banker Gnodde has been courting Saudi officials since Aramco first announced plans for the listing more than two years ago, and is managing the bank’s efforts in the kingdom, the people said.
When Egyptian-born Powell returned to Goldman Sachs last year after time in the Trump administration, the firm carved out a new role for her in the investment-banking division. She was tasked with courting large sovereign wealth funds, especially in the Gulf. Her appointment was notable because she had no prior banking experience and it wasn’t until this year that she completed the required exams for Wall Street bankers.
Powell started visiting the country in the run up to Aramco’s record debut bond issue, which Goldman Sachs helped manage, one of the people said. The Arabic speaker and former U.S. deputy national security adviser has played a key role in pitching for business using her deep connections in the Middle East, the people said.
On the Ground
Goldman Sachs has been building its presence in Saudi Arabia for some time, boosting headcount, securing a stock-trading license and getting involved in key deals including the kingdom’s first euro-denominated bond sale. The bank hired JPMorgan’s Mohammed Nazer to join its investment banking team in the kingdom, people said in July.
These efforts are yielding results. The bank is closing in on  HSBC Holdings  Plc (LON:HSBA) and JPMorgan that have for years dominated dealmaking in the kingdom. Goldman Sachs was the second top M&A adviser in the country last year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The bank advised petrochemical giant Saudi Basic Industries Corp. on its $69 billion sale to Aramco and is working on Riyad Bank’s merger with National Commercial Bank. It also advised on Saudi British Bank’s $5 billion combination with Alawwal Bank.
Saudi Risk
Still, operating Saudi Arabia isn’t without its risks. Investment banking fees are limited compared with other markets and the hype over deals masks a struggle to attract long-term foreign direct investments crucial to reduce the reliance on oil. While FDI more than doubled last year to about $3 billion, it remains well below the average level of the past decade.
That’s in part due to uncertainty over the government’s economic plans, human rights record and its 2017 declared crackdown on corruption, which ensnared hundreds of billionaires and businessmen. Questions also remain over whether Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman knew about or ordered Khashoggi’s killing, an allegation the kingdom denies.
“When you do business in emerging markets, your systems have to be much more robust,” said Schroder’s Knutson. “If that level of vigilance doesn’t stay high when the money comes thick and fast, it can dull your sensitivity to risks. If you let your guard down, emerging market risks will haunt you for a long time.”"

The three main U.S. indexes opened with modest declines. The Stoxx Europe 600 Index dropped a second day, led by food and beverage and health-care shares. The pound fluctuated as embattled British Prime Minister Boris Johnson insisted he won’t ask for another Brexit delay, while U.K. wage and unemployment data beat estimates. Most euro-zone sovereign bonds nudged lower as European Central Bank officials prepare to meet. Treasuries added to declines from Monday.
The recent pullback in the bond rally “is a correction to an outsized move in yields during August, not a turn in the trend,” Kit Juckes, chief global FX strategist at  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) SA, wrote in his daily note. “Last Friday’s U.S. labor market data show, clearly enough for me, that the U.S. economy is slowing slowly but steadily as the global trade slowdown infects it.”
Investors are awaiting the ECB’s policy decisions on Thursday and those next week by the Federal Reserve and Bank of England as they assess how much monetary easing may be looming. On the foreign-trade front, China removed one more hurdle for foreign investment into its capital markets on Tuesday.
Elsewhere, oil extended gains to the highest level in almost six weeks as Saudi Arabia’s new energy minister signaled his commitment to production cuts ahead of an OPEC+ meeting later this week. Gold headed for its fourth day of declines, sinking close to $1,490 an ounce."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A federal appeals court revived a lawsuit by  Spirit Airlines  (N:SAVE) passengers who said the low-cost carrier blindsided them by imposing unexpected carry-on bag fees on tickets bought through Cheapoair,  Expedia  (NASDAQ:EXPE), Priceline and Travelocity.
The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan said 22 passengers could sue for breach of contract because there was no evidence that Spirit promptly notified them about the fees, and there were ""ambiguities"" in the prices they would pay.
Spirit and its lawyers did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Compared with many carriers, Spirit relies more on ancillary fees to offset the financial drag from lower base fares.
The plaintiffs accused the Miramar, Florida-based carrier of knowing that its online travel agents hid the ""gotcha"" bag fees they would have to pay at the airport.
They said these fees often exceeded the cost of their tickets, and totaled millions of dollars a year.
Spirit countered that federal law precluded the lawsuit, and that its ""contract of carriage"" specifically provided that a passenger could take one carry-on bag into the cabin, for a fee.
The appeals court returned the case to U.S. District Judge William Kuntz in Brooklyn, who had dismissed it last November.
""This is a great victory for air travelers nationwide,"" the plaintiffs' lawyer John Hermina said in an interview. He said his clients will pursue their case in the district court.
On Tuesday, Spirit advertised carry-on bag fees for an Oct. 1 flight to Fort Lauderdale, Florida, from New York's LaGuardia Airport ranging from $28, if booked on its website, to $65, if paid at the gate. Base fares ranged from $26 to $121.99.

The case is Cox et al v Spirit Airlines Inc, 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 18-3484.

393,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 10, 2019 10:15AM ET</span>",Technology hands start ups key to $5.1 trillion FX market,"By Tommy Wilkes and Saikat Chatterjee
LONDON (Reuters) - More than five years since global foreign exchange (FX) trading was tainted by a rigging scandal, a handful of banks are more dominant than ever and show no sign of weakening their grip on the $5.1 trillion-a-day electronic market.
But below the radar a new breed of start-ups is seeking to break their hegemony by pursuing the smaller but higher-margin customer-facing FX business used by asset managers, pension funds and insurance companies.
Data analytics firm Coalition estimates the bulk of daily flows are between banks and the majority are likely to remain with the big lenders, notably Citi, JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC), HSBC and UBS who together hold almost 45% of worldwide FX trading, up from around 35% in 2012.
The upstarts say banks can read trading patterns to obtain higher prices from asset managers, who should instead save millions of dollars a year, as much as 50% in FX trading costs, by trading directly with each other.
The cost of trading depends on size, currency, liquidity and the time of day. For a $25 million transaction in euro/dollar, a mid-sized asset manager can pay a spread of 1 to 2 ""pips"" for trading via a large bank, which equates to $5,000.
Banks, who often use FX trading to win more lucrative business such as structured products, hedging solutions and treasury services, say that their dominance and creditworthiness allow them to offer clients the best prices in the safest way.
""We can also match more liquidity internally, allowing us to secure better pricing for clients than if we always had to go out to the market as those smaller companies have to,"" said Richard Anthony, HSBC's Global Head of FX eRisk.
Nevertheless, there are now 80 or more venues trading FX, with one or two launching each year, Marketfactory, a firm that offers clients an interface to trade on them, says.
This is largely because technology costs, previously a major barrier to entry, have dropped, with the Bank of International Settlements estimating that developing a trading platform costs $5-$10 million, versus $100-$150 million in the early 2000s. 
One preparing to go live this year is New York-based FX HedgePool whose founder Jay Moore said banks include costs such as credit and market risk transfer, capital, technology, platform fees and staff salaries in their quotes.  
""We seek to significantly reduce these costs by allowing institutions to source liquidity from each other,"" said Moore, who will face competition from platforms like London-based 24 Exchange, which began operating in August. 
(Graphic: FX market share, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/12/2879/2854/FX%20market%20share.png)
CAUGHT IN THE NET
Investors betting on currencies or hedging stock and bond exposure do so mostly on bank platforms, where they choose from continuously streamed quotes. 
Alternatively, they use multi-dealer platforms such as those from Refinitiv or CME, where banks compete on price.
Although a breakdown of bank market shares for serving buy-side customers is not easily available, in London, the world's biggest forex trading hub, six dealers accounted for 74% of all spot transactions in October 2018, Bank of England data shows.
And in New York four dealers corner three-quarters of spot trading, New York Federal Reserve data shows.
The start-ups argue that while transaction ""spreads"" on currency trading have plummeted in recent years, investors often pay significantly for ""market impact"", the degree to which large, staggered orders can skew market pricing.
Claude Goulet, CEO of London-based Siege FX, another start-up set to launch in 2019, says his analysis shows the costs associated with market impact for a recent large euro/dollar transaction totaled 2.5 times the cost of the spread paid. 
Siege is building a matching system to check when one asset manager's currency needs can be ""netted"" against another's, which would eliminate the need to trade through banks. 
Goulet reckons large investors netting 20% of their forex flows through Siege would save millions of dollars a year.
""If you are systematically trading with the same banks you can assume the bank knows what you are doing,"" he said. ""That doesn't correspond with reducing your footprint.""
NICHE PROVIDERS
The biggest challenges facing FX start ups are settlement risk and operational differences, where an asset manager's system is not compatible in matters such as legal documentation.
Because FX is traded bilaterally ""over-the-counter"" rather than on exchanges, there is a credit exposure for two days after the trade is executed before funds are exchanged.
While this is not a concern for a major fund manager trading with a big bank as its counterparty, it puts them off dealing with start ups, said David Mercer, CEO of LMAX Exchange said.
""The large banks still dominate FX trading for this reason (operational issues such as legal documentation). That might change in the next 10 years but for now, the new providers are very much niche providers,"" Ugo Lancioni, managing director of currency management at Neuberger Berman, said. 
(Graphic: Market Share FX, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/12/3860/3833/Market%20Share%20FX.jpg)
BIG BANKS DOMINANT
None of the half a dozen funds canvassed by Reuters appeared concerned yet about market concentration, saying they were open to trading with start ups but the credit issue needed solving.
If anything, the squeeze on forex trading profitability since the 2008 financial crisis has made it difficult for smaller banks to compete with the giants on price. 
Andreas Anschperger, European head of FX trading at Allianz (DE:ALVG) Global Investors said he had not observed an adverse impact. His company has opted to receive FX quotes from 10-15 banks, down from as many as 20 some years ago. 

""(The big banks) have the ability to support us, we can select a full suite of services,"" he told Reuters.

LONDON (Reuters) - Marks & Spencer's exit from the FTSE 100 (FTSE) underlines how times have changed since the blue-chip index was launched in 1984, when it was dominated by British companies including household names like M&S, Cadbury and House of Fraser.
Home-grown talent is increasingly absent from the FTSE, now valued at $2.4 trillion, as failure to grow domestically or make the cut internationally has seen companies disappear via mergers, demotions, de-listing or privatization.
MFI Furniture was among founding members of the index that failed to survive after privately-owned IKEA entered the UK market in the 1980s.
British Home Stores and Magnet & Southerns were other big retail names that have either failed or been bought by other companies.
These household brands have been giving way to big corporations that make the bulk of their revenues outside Britain. The most recent FTSE constituents pocket just 29% of their revenue from the UK.
Marks & Spencer (L:MKS), which was the fifth-most-valuable company at the FTSE's inception, now ranks just 111th by market capitalization -- too small to qualify.
M&S shares have lost about 40% of their value since January 2018 as the British high street stalwart has struggled with competition in clothing and food, particularly online.
Other famous names at the risk of falling through the trap doors soon are Morrison Supermarkets (L:MRW), Sainsbury's (L:SBRY) and B&Q-owner  Kingfisher  (L:KGF), now sitting at the bottom-end of the index.
Until recently, M&S, Sainsbury's and  Tesco  (L:TSCO) were some of the 28 original members still in the FTSE.
New joiners in the most recent reshuffle included precious metals mining firm  Polymetal  (L:POLYP), Hikma (L:HIK), a generic drugmaker earning the bulk of its revenue from the United States, and aerospace and defense group  Meggitt  (L:MGGT).
By sector weightings, banks & financial services, mining and energy stocks now make up nearly 40% of the index, while retail has shrunk to less than 3% from 8% in 1996.
Other major sectors to take a hit in the last two decades were technology, media & telecoms, which together have shrunk to just 7.5% from nearly a quarter in early 2000s.
Here's the sectoral break-down of the index since 1996:

The holiday season, which includes Black Friday, Christmas and New Year shopping, marks the busiest time for retailers and records the most sales during the year.
""It's critical we build the right team across our stores and supply chain to deliver an exceptional holiday experience for our guests during the busiest time of the year,"" Chief Human Resources Officer Melissa Kremer said.
The seasonal hiring would include about 125,000 employees in stores and 8,000 at its distribution and fulfillment centers in the United States.
Big-box retailers have been investing more on their websites and mobile apps as consumers prefer to shop online and have it delivered to their doorstep or pick up in stores, rather than wait in long lines at billing counters.
Target is the one of the first retailers to layout its hiring plans for the holidays. The 8% rise in holiday hiring is much lower than last year's 20% increase.
 United Parcel  Service Inc (N:UPS), the world's biggest parcel delivery firm, said on Monday it was planning to hire 100,000 holiday workers, the same number as last year, hinting at a softening in the U.S. consumer economy.
Retail employment contracted for a seventh straight month in August to hit the lowest level since January 2016. Department store jobs, which have been hard hit by online competition, sunk to the lowest point since the federal government started tracking the data in 1990.
Target said it would pay workers $13 for an hour, a wage that it has been paying employees since June. The company will also invest $2 million in an employee rewards program for the holidays."

A Commerzbank spokesman said that the bank could not comment on ongoing investigations.
""We are fully cooperating with the authorities and hope the matter is resolved as quickly as possible,"" he added.
The investigations focus on a practice, known as cum-ex, which involves cross-border trading of company shares around a syndicate of banks, investors and hedge funds to create the impression of numerous owners, with each entitled to a tax rebate.
The investigation into the scheme began as far back as 2013. Prosecutors have said the practice misled the German government into paying tax refunds that have cost the country more than 5 billion euros.
Earlier this month the first trial began as part of a wider investigation into the scheme, aimed at recovering billions from banks who profited.

405,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 10, 2019 06:52AM ET</span>",Bond Bonanza Gives Traders a Chance to Tidy Up,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- The U.S. bond market is having a September to remember as far as debt sales are concerned. Investors ought to use this borrowing binge to their advantage.
Investment-grade companies issued some $74 billion of debt last week, a record for any comparable period since at least 1972, and it looks as if an additional $35 billion is on the way in the coming days. More than $11 billion of asset-backed securities and commercial- and residential-mortgage debt is being pitched to investors, Bloomberg News’s Adam Tempkin reported. The leveraged-loan market has 12 bank meetings lined up, and a high-yield deal or two seems likely.
Much of the focus of this borrowing spree has been on the companies themselves, and rightly so. After all, it’s not every day that a company like Deere & Co. can set a record for the lowest-yielding 30-year investment-grade corporate debt, or Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). issues long bonds despite holding more than $200 billion of cash and investment securities. As I’ve written before, companies’ decision-making is fairly simple: They see low yields, and they sell bonds. 
However, this should also be a time for investors to get introspective. Even with the wide swing in benchmark U.S. yields, spreads in corporate credit markets have remained remarkably steady. Since the start of August, yields have declined about 50 basis points on the 30-year Treasury and 40 points on the 10-year. Yet during that same period, the average investment-grade spread is up only 10 basis points. It’s roughly the same in the high-yield market, where spreads are below their 2019 average. Leveraged-loan prices have barely budged in recent weeks.
In other words, there’s still time to clean up bond portfolios heading into the final months of 2019. I imagine it can be hard for investors to deviate from their strategies, considering the staggering total-return figures across debt markets this year. But looking at the gains in the context of recent history starts to paint a clearer picture:
 U.S. investment-grade corporate bonds: 13.7% (on pace for highest since 2009) U.S. high-yield bonds: 11.3% (highest since 2016) U.S. Treasuries: 8.4% (highest since 2011) U.S. leveraged loans: 6.4% (highest since 2016) U.S. mortgage-backed securities: 5.5% (highest since 2014) U.S. asset-backed securities: 4.3% (highest since 2011)Clearly, speculative-grade securities aren’t flying quite as high as they might initially appear. By contrast, the fact that the asset-backed securities index, stuffed with triple-A rated obligations, is quietly having its best year in recent memory indicates investors’ preference for higher-quality bonds.
Of course, the blistering rally in investment-grade corporate bonds can’t be separated from the huge increase in negative-yielding debt worldwide. Its proliferation has created a conundrum for investors in Europe and Japan because even 10-year Treasuries yield less than zero after hedging for currency risk. But in both regions, the yield turns positive by picking up an average U.S. corporate bond. Tetsuo Ishihara, a U.S. macro strategist at Mizuho Securities USA who has his finger on the pulse of the Japanese markets, said in a recent report that he had heard “retail consensus in Japan is that the US 30y is heading to 0%” over the next several years. As a result, “US IG is also a target for both retail and wholesale.”
Back in the U.S., some big money managers are advocating the “up in quality” trade (or, at least, voicing concerns about riskier securities). In a Financial Times Q&A about negative-yielding debt — with questions like “Is there a bubble in the bond market?” and “Will there be a damaging crash?” — JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Asset Management’s Bob Michele stressed that “Investors should improve the credit quality of their holdings and concentrate primarily on positive yielding investment grade rated bonds.” BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK).’s Rick Rieder said the riskiest areas and those offering the least value are “loan markets, especially in sectors where credit quality and covenants are weak.” Daniel Ivascyn, group chief investment officer at Pacific Investment Management Co., answered the same question by pointing to parts of the credit markets with deteriorating fundamentals and investor protections.
None of this is to say that riskier debt will deliver imminent losses. In fact, high-quality sovereign debt was the big loser on Monday, with yields rising on Treasuries and German bunds ahead of a potentially hawkish European Central Bank meeting and amid speculation that Germany is considering a “shadow budget” to bolster public investments, providing a much-needed fiscal boost to its economy.
The slow-but-steady economic growth since the financial crisis, combined with ever-accommodating central banks, has made reaching for yield the obvious trade. Sure, some energy companies crashed and burned along the way, and retailers have floundered, with discount merchandise chain Fred’s filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Monday and Forever 21 Inc. perhaps up next. Yet by and large, companies have endured during the longest expansion on record, aided by low interest rates. Fixed-income investors have been rewarded handsomely along the way. 
The reasons to believe that trend can’t last are beginning to pile up. There’s the yield curve, of course, which has been inverted for just about all of the past three months. But notably, as Shawn Donnan wrote for Bloomberg Businessweek, recession is becoming a reality in at least some corners of America, like manufacturing and agriculture. U.S. consumers have been a resilient part of the recovery, but as Komal Sri-Kumar noted in a Bloomberg Opinion column last week, their spending habits are hardly a leading indicator. And their outlook for the economy is slumping.
Bond investors, who clearly fear nothing more than a liquidity crunch during a rush to the exits, probably shouldn’t wait to see whether recession fears were overblown or warranted. This month’s supply offers a convenient opportunity for them to tidy up their holdings and position for a time when making money in fixed income isn’t quite so easy. "

407,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 10, 2019 06:22AM ET</span>",PG&E’s Plan to Cap Fire Liabilities at $18 Billion Draws Outrage,"(Bloomberg) -- California utility giant PG&E Corp. (NYSE:PCG) has issued its long-awaited plan for emerging from the largest utility bankruptcy in U.S. history: Raise debt, offer equity and cap the wildfire liabilities that led to its collapse at $18 billion -- less than half of what victims and insurers have asked for.
Within hours of its release, the plan had sparked outrage.
The proposal is “a fraction of what wildfire victims would need to rebuild their lives,” said Patrick McCallum, who co-chairs a group representing victims of blazes that PG&E’s equipment has been blamed for sparking. The fires destroyed tens of thousands of structures across Northern California in 2017 and 2018, killed more than 100 people and buried the company in so many legal claims it was forced to file for Chapter 11 in January.
The plan PG&E submitted in federal court on Monday kicks off the most contentious phase yet of a bankruptcy that has already attracted some of the biggest names in the financial world, including Pacific Investment Management Co. and Elliott Management Corp. Since the company’s collapse -- what has been described as climate change’s largest financial casualty to date -- wildfire victims, state politicians, activist investors and ratepayer advocates have clashed over the future of the company.
PG&E Chief Financial Officer Jason Wells described the company’s plan on Monday as a “crucial step in a multistep process” and said it may eventually be revised, depending on what the courts find the company legally responsible for paying.
“It’s a framework,” Wells said.
Mike Danko, a lawyer representing some wildfire victims, called it a plan that’s “dead on arrival.”
Wildfire Estimates
Complicating PG&E’s proposal is the fact that claims tied to the blazes are getting tallied as part of a separate court process that’s only just begun. While the company has given estimates, it may be months before the utility has a clear picture of its actual liabilities.
Any exit plan hinges on that estimate. The official tally could lead to an entire rewrite of PG&E’s reorganization. A total that’s higher than PG&E is capable of paying threatens to wipe out current shareholders since, under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, fire victims would get paid in full first.
That puts PG&E in a tenuous position as key creditor groups clamor to pitch their own restructuring proposals to U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Dennis Montali. In August, Montali said he doesn’t expect PG&E’s plan to be the final since some details aren’t yet available. But he said the company must present something credible or else he may open the door to rival ones.
Meanwhile, time is running out for PG&E. The company has until June to get out of bankruptcy if it wants to participate in a fund recently established by California to help utilities cover the cost of future fires. The alternative is facing the prospect of another catastrophic blaze that could force it into financial ruin once again.
Hitting Snags
PG&E’s plan has already hit some snags: A group led by Pimco and Elliott have been floating one plan that would all but wipe out the stakes of current stakeholders and hand control of the company over to them. They’ve fought to have their proposal considered by Montali. PG&E shareholders would keep their current holdings under the company’s plan, but their stakes may be significantly diluted by new shares issued.
On Sept. 6, a measure that would’ve allowed the company to use tax-free state bonds to pay off its fire claims stalled in California’s legislature. And San Francisco is offering to buy some of the utility’s local electrical assets for $2.5 billion. The city -- PG&E’s hometown -- sees the deal as an opportunity to save ratepayers money and fulfill its long-held desire to break away from the company.
What Bloomberg Intelligence Says
“A reportedly failed bid to use tax-free state bonds to cover wildfire liabilities likely makes the sufficiency and nature of plan funding even more susceptible to attack.”
--Negisa Balluku, litigation analyst

PG&E filed its plan without an outline that describes in plain terms how creditors will be treated. That outline, known as a disclosure statement, typically helps creditors decide how to vote on the reorganization. Montali permitted PG&E to put off filing it.
The company did submit a summary with key details. “Under the plan we filed today, we will meet our commitment to fairly compensate wildfire victims and we will emerge from Chapter 11 financially sound and able to continue meeting California’s clean energy goals,” PG&E Chief Executive Officer Bill Johnson said in a statement Monday.

408,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 10, 2019 06:19AM ET</span>","Aramco Readies Banks as IPO Is Coming ‘Very Soon,’ CEO Says","(Bloomberg) -- State oil giant Saudi Aramco said it’s lining up banks for its long-awaited initial public offering as the sale is now imminent.
Banks will be chosen “soon,” Chief Executive Officer Amin Nasser said at an industry conference in Abu Dhabi. Confirmation of the underwriters will signal that the share sale -- set to be the world’s largest -- is finally in the offing after plans were put on hold last year.
“We have always said Aramco is ready for listing whenever the shareholder makes a decision to list,” Nasser said on Tuesday. “It’s going to be very soon.”
Global investment banks presented a week of pitches starting in late August, people with knowledge of the matter said this month. Saudi Arabian Oil Co., as the company is formally known, is expected to choose about four or five banks to lead the IPO marketing as joint global coordinators, while a larger number will work on the deal in more junior capacities, the people said.
The main exchange to list shares will be in Saudi Arabia, while officials from bourses in London, New York and Hong Kong have been pitching to host the IPO’s foreign portion.
“We are ready for whatever the decision is to list locally -- which is going to be the primary listing -- but we are also ready for listing outside the kingdom,” Nasser said.
For Aramco, the domestic segment of the IPO could be key to the prospects for an international listing, with a high valuation at home potentially raising the bar for foreign investment. With persistently weak oil prices, that’s crucial to the success of Saudi Arabia’s plans to fund an ambitious economic agenda.
The kingdom has also held discussions with some of its wealthiest families about becoming anchor investors in the stake sale, people with knowledge of the talks said this month. That underscores the country’s desire to ensure there’s enough demand for the offering as low crude prices weigh on the economy."
409,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 10, 2019 05:37AM ET</span>",Waning ECB stimulus bets push bond yields higher,"By Karin Strohecker
LONDON (Reuters) - Global bond yields rose on Monday, amid growing caution over the extent to which the European Central Bank will add stimulus to boost an ailing economy this week and rising hopes that Berlin could loosen its purse strings.
Germany's 30-year benchmark bond yield briefly broke into positive territory for the first time in more than a month, while U.S. Treasury yields climbed to 18-day highs.
Safe-haven assets have been caught up in the fixed income sell-off, with gold  touching a one-month trough and Japan's yen plumbing a five-week low. But equities failed to make gains, as weak Chinese producer prices data dampened the mood. 
The bond moves comes as markets are gearing up for Thursday's European Central Bank (ECB) meeting, which is widely expected to deliver a cut to interest rates and point to further bond-buying stimulus.
However, there is a growing chorus of opinion that ECB policymakers and other central banks with negative interest rates and sub-zero long-term sovereign bond yields are nearing the limits of stimulus policies. 
Germany also starts to debate its 2020 budget in parliament later in the day, where Finance Minister Olaf Scholz's speech will be scrutinized after Reuters reported Berlin was looking into creating a ""shadow budget"" to boost public investment and effectively circumvent limits set by its national debt rules.
""These stories have become more frequent in recent weeks,"" said Deutsche Bank's Jim Reid. ""Whilst the market always gets more excited by the headlines than is justified by hard evidence of any change in policy, it's fair to conclude that market pressure and chatter on this story is building."" 
Europe's largest economy is teetering on the brink of recession, but strict national spending rules have tied policymakers hands on fiscal policy. 
The U.S. Federal Reserve is also widely expected to cut interest rates next week as policymakers race to shield the global economy from risks, which also include Britain's planned exit from the European Union. 
With interest rates plumbing record lows in many countries and the effectiveness of further bond-buying muted by already record-low borrowing costs for governments, attention has turned to increased public spending or tax cuts to fire up growth.
A CHINESE CLOUD
The sell-off in fixed income markets failed to lift global stocks, where the mood was subdued amid concerns over the health of the world economy. 
Data showing China's mainland factory-gate prices shrank at their fastest pace in three years, as flagging demand at home and abroad forced some businesses to slash prices, saw Asian bourses slip lower.
In Europe, the pan-European stocks benchmark index STOXX 600 (STOXX) fell 0.4% in a second day of losses. 
China-sensitive German stocks (GDAXI) eased 0.3% while France's CAC (FCHI) dropped 0.6%.
""China inflation data was probably the worst combination of prints the market could have hoped for,"" said Stephen Innes, Market Strategist AXI Trader. 
""While the enormous slide in China factory gate prices reminded us of what we already know, U.S. tariffs are sinking the Chinese economy and at a much quicker pace than anyone could have imagined."" 
However, climbing bond yields helped lift European banking stocks (SX7P) 0.3% - one of the few sectors in the black. 
U.S. stock futures pointed to a lower open on Wall Street after the S&P 500 (SPX) ended flat in New York on Monday. 
In currencies, the rise in Treasury yields helped lift the dollar to touch a five-week high of 107.50 yen . The euro (EUR=EBS) was flat at $1.104 after reaching an overnight high of $1.1067.
The pound  traded near a six-week high of $1.2385 after a law came into force demanding that Prime Minister Boris Johnson delay Britain's departure from the European Union unless he can strike a divorce deal with the bloc.
Oil futures hit their highest level in six weeks in Asia after Saudi Arabia's new energy minister confirmed he would stick with his country's policy of limiting crude output to support prices. 
U.S. crude traded at $57.97 a barrel after hitting the highest since July 31. Brent crude futures climbed to $62.67 a barrel.

Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman, who became Saudi Arabia's new energy minister on Sunday, told reporters there would be ""no radical"" change in Saudi's oil policy. Saudi Arabia is OPEC's de facto leader.

(Reuters) - European shares fell in early trading on Tuesday, dragged down by a sell-off in defensive sectors and on disappointing China data that stoked recession worries ahead of the European Central Bank's monetary policy meeting later this week.
The pan-European stocks benchmark index STOXX 600 (STOXX) fell 0.6% by 0840 GMT with all major country indices in the red. The index was on track to post its worst session in more than two weeks.
Euro zone stocks (STOXXE) also weakened as investors focused on the ECB's meeting on Thursday, when it is widely expected to cut its deposit rate for the first time since 2016 and restart an asset purchase program.
David Madden, analyst at CMC Markets in London, said he expected a subdued trading week in Europe. ""We're going to have traders sitting on their hands between now and Thursday when the ECB (make) their announcement.""
Defensive sectors such as healthcare (SXDP), utilities (SX6P) and food and beverages (SX3P) were among the biggest losers. The stocks had been in high demand over the past three months amid trade and growth uncertainties.
European banks (SX7P) posted the largest increase, led by London banks  Barclays  (L:BARC),  Standard Chartered  Bank (L:STAN) and RBS (L:RBS). Swiss bank UBS Group (S:UBSG) rose 2% after Kepler Cheuvreux upgraded the stock to ""buy"".
Euro zone banks were trading flat after rising 1.3% earlier in the session. They have risen 9% in the past five days in one of their strongest rallies since April 2017.
Expectations of a stimulus from global central banks were strengthened on Tuesday after weak factory data from China showed prices shrunk in August at their fastest pace in three years.
Technology stocks (SX8P), a key growth sector, fell 1.3%, tracking their U.S. counterparts lower. (N)
On the corporate side, JD Sports (L:JD) topped the STOXX 600 after it reported higher first-half pretax profit, helped by more demand for gym apparel and premium branded fashion.

412,By Investing.com,"<span>Sep 10, 2019 05:02AM ET</span>","StockBeat: Barclays, Lloyds, RBS Emerge From PPI Nightmare","By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- Harry Flashman, the fictional Victorian hero created by George MacDonald Fraser, used to say that once your vitals are trapped in the wringer, all you can do is holler with a good grace until you come out the other side.
That’s pretty much what U.K. banking stocks are doing this week, as the sector tries to wake up from an eight-year nightmare – also known as compensation for mis-selling payment protection insurance.
  Barclays   (LON:BARC) rose 4.2% Tuesday after it said it would take what it expects to be a final hit of between 1.2 and 1.6 billion pounds for the PPI scandal. That comes a day after Lloyds Banking Group (LON:LLOY) had said it would need to increase provisions by between 1.2 and 1.8 billion pounds. Royal Bank of Scotland (LON:RBS) had said last week it expected a more modest final reckoning of between 600 and 900 million pounds. Lloyds was up 2.0% Tuesday while RBS was up 1.6%.
That’s considerably ahead of the U.K. FTSE 100, which was down 0.3%, and the Stoxx 600, which was down 0.5% on overdue profit-taking after some harsher rhetoric from Chinese media on the subject of trade and of White House economic advisor Peter Navarro in particular.
The Financial Conduct Authority, the banks’ lead regulator, had set a deadline of Aug. 29 for compensation claims, triggering a last-minute surge in activity enthusiastically stoked by professional advisory firms. The fact that all the major banks are raising their provisioning now that the application forms are in suggests that people were all too happy to jump on the compensation train before it left the station. Common sense, however, suggests that anyone who sustained real financial damage filed their complaint long ago. It would not be surprising to see that the final batch of claims turn out to be of much lower quality – and thus generating proportionately smaller payouts – than in previous years.
Whatever the final outcome, British banks now look to be free of a factor that has hammered their stocks repeatedly for the best part of a decade. If the U.K. can avoid a disorderly Brexit that would inevitably hit the quality of domestic loan portfolios, then another major risk will have been negotiated, U.K. interest rates will stand a better chance of staying positive, and the outlook for bank profits will look considerably rosier. Nor will U.K. pay growth, which hit an annual rate of 4% for the first time since 2008 in August, do the banks’ balance sheets any harm.
Meanwhile, the wringer may be preparing to process its next victims. The European Court of Justice signaled earlier Thursday that it is likely to rule that the Spanish banking sector’s practice of selling mortgages tied to a local price index was “abusive”. That paves the way for millions of Spaniards to claim compensation from their lenders. The worst affected, Caixabank (MC:CABK) and   Bankia   (MC:BKIA), both fell by 2.9%, while Sabadell (MC:SABE) fell 2.0%. The country’s two biggest banks, Santander (MC:SAN) and BBVA (MC:BBVA), fell by 0.3%, reflecting the fact that their balance sheets are bigger and more diversified away from their home market. Spain’s IBEX 35 was down 0.4%."

Markets have factored in the European Central Bank’s president slashing interest rates and restarting quantitative easing, so it will take a multi-faceted stimulus package in his penultimate meeting Thursday to impress investors. Bond gains have faltered and the euro has staged a recovery from the weakest since 2017 this month after opposition from some officials raised doubts over the size and timing of any new asset purchases.
Money markets are still betting on a 15-basis-point interest rate cut on Sept. 12, a bigger drop than the 10 basis points forecast by economists. Those expectations for policy easing to revive inflation have depressed the euro to $1.10 and driven German bund yields well below the ECB’s minus 0.4% deposit rate.
“I think that the ECB will struggle to exceed the already dovish market expectations,” said Valentin Marinov, head of Group-of-10 currency strategy at  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) SA. Any failure to mitigate the fallout from even more negative rates on banks and to lift limits on the bonds the ECB can buy could spur euro gains to $1.12, he said. “Without them, people will conclude that Draghi is done and that the ECB may not have the courage for more once he is gone.”
Goldman Sachs’ strategists have stopped recommending bets on the euro’s decline against the yen ahead of the announcement, while  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) has scaled down its estimate for the size of future asset purchases.
That caution led European bonds to fall Monday, the latest in a series of pullbacks from the rally. Longer maturities have been worst hit, following poor demand in a 30-year German auction, as they would benefit the most from renewed ECB asset purchases. Allianz (DE:ALVG) Global Investors has warned of a bigger sell-off in German bunds.
Here are further views by analysts:

417,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 10, 2019 02:55AM ET</span>",Car makers near CO2 cliff-edge in electrification race,"By Laurence Frost and Edward Taylor
PARIS/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Time is running out for European car makers, which have waited until the last minute to try to meet ambitious EU emissions targets and face billions in fines if they fail to comply.
Manufacturers from PSA Group (PA:PEUP) to Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) will use this week's Frankfurt auto show to reveal the new models and strategies they hope can slash carbon dioxide emissions within months.
But it is a challenge fraught with danger, as the cost of pushing pricey technology on unconvinced consumers could hammer profits in an industry already suffering a downturn in sales.
""You have cars that cost an extra 10,000 euros to build, fleet-emissions targets requiring a certain sales volume and consumers who may or may not want them,"" said one PSA executive.
""All the ingredients are there for a powerful explosive.""
By next year, CO2 must be cut to 95 grams per kilometer for 95% of cars from the current 120.5g average - a figure that has risen of late as consumers spurn fuel-efficient diesels and embrace SUVs. All new cars in the EU must be compliant in 2021.
Another 37.5% cut in carbon dioxide fumes is required between 2021 and 2030 in addition to the 40% cut in emissions between 2007 and 2021.
The timing could hardly be worse, with the world's main auto markets in decline and the sector braced for a chaotic British exit from the European Union as well as a protracted U.S-China trade war.
The industry has long since given up pushing for the goals to be relaxed - a political impossibility underlined by a resurgent climate protest movement that has added the Frankfurt show to its target list.
Volkswagen's chief executive, Herbert Diess, said the regulatory crunch and growing support for green causes proves that his company's 80 billion euros ($88 billion) bet on becoming the world's largest manufacturer of electric cars is right.
""Even Toyota and some other competitors, which were slow to bring EV's, they are now also betting on electric. So we are right,"" Diess said.
New electric cars wheeled out at the show on Tuesday include PSA Group's Opel Corsa-e mini and the ID.3 compact from Volkswagen. The German car maker is also making hybrid power standard-issue in its Golf bestseller.
The show is also seized upon by activist groups. Greenpeace on Tuesday inflated a 1,400 cubic meter black balloon emblazoned with the word CO2 from the outsize exhaust pipes of a monster truck to protest the car industry's reliance on combustion engines.
 Fiat  Chrysler (MI:FCHA), which lacks adequate green technology, has agreed to pay Tesla (O:TSLA) hundreds of millions of euros to pool emissions scores with its electric cars and escape penalties.
CRUNCH TIME
For years, image-conscious mass automakers have placed electrified models at the center of their show stands but near the margins of their commercial offerings. Only now will they be forced to sell them in large numbers, challenging profitability.
To meet the targets, sales of electric cars would need to triple to 6% of the market by 2021, and rechargeable hybrids surge fivefold to a 5% market share, German engineering firm FEV Consulting estimates. 
Fines of 95 euros ($105) per car, per excess gram of CO2 quickly add up to hundreds of millions of euros.
""Market acceptance of a lot of this tech and exactly what people are willing to pay remains very, very unclear,"" said Max Warburton, an analyst at brokerage Sanford C. Bernstein, who predicts that car makers will lean on heavily discounted sales to fleet customers and even their own employees.
Rather than incur fines that could total 25 billion euros in 2021 if current lineups were left unchanged, car makers are engaged in a huge product overhaul likely to wipe more than half that amount from combined profits, Bernstein projects.
Many electrified offerings are arriving just in time - or in many cases too late - for deliveries to begin in January, when less efficient models will also become more scarce.
Hard on the heels of VW's electric ID.3, the Golf 8 to be unveiled next month heralds a mass deployment of 48-volt hybrid technology at the very heart of Europe's auto market.
Such mild hybrids add less cost, starting at 500 euros per car, but bring more modest emissions cuts than plug-in hybrids or pure electrics costing an extra 5,000-10,000 euros, by comparison with an equivalent gasoline model.
MODEL CULL
French car makers face a bigger hit to margins than German rivals, analysts say, because they lack significant U.S. and Chinese earnings to soften the blow.
 Renault  (PA:RENA), reliant on its aging Zoe electric car, is rushing to add hybrid versions of its Clio and Captur subcompacts now expected in the second quarter of 2020.
PSA is counting on pricier plug-ins and electric versions of its DS3,  Peugeot  208 and Opel Corsa to claim 7% of its total sales.
Industry executives expect the cull to be replicated by other car makers, hitting European automotive jobs already threatened by the shift to electrification.

""During the year we're likely to see models dropped and some layoffs,"" said Georgeric Legros, Paris-based director at consulting firm AlixPartners.

The former English teacher steps down as executive chairman of China’s largest company on his 55th birthday after amassing a $41.8 billion fortune -- a trove surpassed only by India’s Mukesh Ambani in Asia, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. His record-breaking rise from a bootstrapped entrepreneur working out of his apartment in 1999 to jet-setting e-commerce mogul is one for the history books, mirroring China’s own evolution from technological backwater to world’s No. 2 economy.
Over two decades, Ma and his co-founders built a business-to-business marketplace into a $460 billion titan that bested EBay Inc. and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)., operates the one of the world’s largest cloud computing businesses, and runs a logistics network that delivers millions of parcels every day. Now the country’s most recognizable businessman, he hands the helm on Tuesday to finance maven Daniel Zhang -- a momentous transition for Asia’s largest corporation.

Ma became Asia’s richest person in 2016, overtaking Dalian Wanda Group Chairman Wang Jianlin. The title now belongs to Reliance Industries Ltd. Chairman Ambani, who’s worth $47.4 billion, according to a Bloomberg ranking of the world’s 500 wealthiest individuals.
The Alibaba co-founder has become the face of Chinese business even while a member of the ruling Communist Party. Ma, who recalled in a 2015 interview how KFC once rejected his job application, currently owns a 5.3% Alibaba stake worth $24.6 billion, or about 10-fold the $2.6 billion his 7.4% slice in 2012 was worth. Since taking over as executive chairman in 2013, Alibaba’s revenue has surged about 1,100% to 378.8 billion yuan ($56.2 billion) in the year ended March 2019. His fortune doesn’t count shares in the company held by his foundation, or the value of stock he’s sold over time.
Ma isn’t the only person to derive fabulous wealth from the Alibaba empire. The company’s trajectory at one point spawned at least 10 other billionaires across its ecosystem, from a parcel delivery company and supermarket to an online payments affiliate. Despite stepping down, Ma is expected to remain pivotal to a sprawling industrial machine with e-commerce at its heart.
“At this point, it’s still unlikely that Zhang would make important decisions without Ma’s support,” said Brock Silvers, managing director at Shanghai-based Kaiyuan Capital, an investment advisory firm.

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazilian online housing broker QuintoAndar has raised $250 million in a new funding round led by Japan's SoftBank Group International, the company said on Tuesday.
The broker has been valued at more than $1 billion in this funding round, a source with knowledge of the matter said.
Besides SoftBank, which launched a $5 billion Latin America fund in March, San Francisco-based Dragoneer Investment Group is investing in the company. Existing partners General Atlantic LLC and Kaszek have also joined this fourth-funding round.
QuintoAndar said in a statement that the proceeds will be used to expand geographically and accelerate growth through partnerships with real estate agencies.
Chief Executive Officer and founder Gabriel Braga told Reuters in an interview that QuintoAndar is considering expanding abroad, but declined to name the countries it might be eyeing.
Founded in 2013, QuintoAndar is a rental platform that does not require tenants to provide a guarantor, a standard requirement in Brazil even for renters with good credit histories.
QuintoAndar has been securing roughly 4,500 new rental contracts per month, five times higher than in 2018."

To start, Amazon Prime Brazil will be a scaled-down version of the U.S. subscription service, offering free unlimited shipping for about 500,000 products out of the 20 million Amazon currently sells in Latin America’s largest economy. Two day-shipping will be available in 90 cities, the company said. Deliveries in other urban centers will take three days or more.
Amazon, which entered Brazil in 2012, is battling established e-commerce competitors, including  MercadoLibre  (NASDAQ:MELI) Inc. which offers free shipping if shoppers spend a certain amount. B2W Cia. Digital, another local rival, offers its own “prime” delivery service with unlimited free shipping, among other perks. Amazon operates two distribution centers in Cajamar, near Sao Paulo, Brazil’s largest city.
“This is a country in which we’re investing for the long run,” Amazon’s Prime and Marketing Vice President Jamil Ghani said in an interview. “Prime is the crown jewel of the consumer business at Amazon.”
Amazon Prime Brazil will offer entertainment perks, including Amazon music, books, games, local magazines and the full content of Prime Video. Amazon currently charges 14.90 reais ($3.64) monthly for its streaming service in Brazil. That compares with 9.90 reais monthly for the beefed-up full Prime membership.
While e-commerce is still small in Brazil, it has been growing fast, driven by the proliferation of smartphones. Sales rose 41% in the last two years, according to Nielsen’s e-commerce researcher Ebit. That compares with 7.3% growth for retail as a whole, according to data from Brazil’s Geography and Statistics Institute.
Brazil is the 19th country to offer Amazon’s membership program, Ghani said. Launched in 2005 in the U.S., Prime helped persuade shoppers to see the retailer as more than just a bookstore. Surveys show Amazon Prime members spend more than non-members.
Prime’s growth in the U.S. has slowed, prompting Amazon to focus on expanding the service globally, including in countries like India. Amazon Prime has more than 100 million members worldwide, including, analysts estimate, a majority of U.S. households.
Amazon debuted in Brazil in 2012 selling e-books. In 2017, it launched a marketplace operation, starting with electronics and appliances. In January, Amazon started selling directly to consumers in 11 categories, including beauty, personal care and baby products. Amazon doesn’t disclose its Brazil revenue."

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian pension funds are sitting on a A$245 billion ($167.38 billion) 'wall of money' that will probably flow overseas because of a lack of domestic options, asset managers say.
Thanks to Australian laws requiring employers to contribute at least 9% of a worker's salary to a pension, superannuation funds, as they are known locally, are the world's third-largest pool of pension assets, worth about $1.9 trillion. The Australian stock market is worth only $1 trillion.
The nearly 2:1 ratio is the highest among major developed economies, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BAML) (N:BAC), and the imbalance is growing - as is the range of overseas markets and assets attracting those funds.
""We have the world's tenth-biggest stock market but the third-biggest pension fund pool,"" said Mark Warburton, BAML head of Australian equity capital markets. ""There is a wall of money waiting to be invested.""
The Australian Bureau of Statistics puts the number at about A$245 billion.
Some of that money has stayed in Australia, such as the A$2.1 billion purchase in March education group Navitas by AustralianSuper, the country's largest pension fund, and private equity group BGH Capital.
(Graphic: Pension fund cash levels near all-time highs - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/AUSTRALIA-FUNDS-PENSIONS/0H001QEVM89L/eikon.png)
But asset managers told Reuters the cash imbalance was putting pressure on Australian funds to find infrastructure, property, private equity and listed companies offshore.
Last month, AustralianSuper agreed to put up to $1 billion into India's National Investment & Infrastructure Fund Ltd (NIIF), and has accumulated major stakes in listed companies such as drinks maker  Diageo  (L:DGE) and consumer company  Reckitt Benckiser  (L:RB).
Superannuation fund-owned IFM Investors, one of the country's largest infrastructure investors, also told Reuters it was expanding its listed equities business outside Australia.
""The scale is just enormous,"" National Australia Bank (AX:NAB) head of markets Drew Bradford said of the potential overseas investments.
According to NAB, about 41% of the biggest funds' assets are currently invested overseas. Nearly three quarters of those funds plan to increase such investments over the next two years, the bank found.
""You are going to have maybe the third-largest nominal pension pot money in the world with half or more of those investments held offshore,"" Bradford said.
AustralianSuper this year announced plans to open an office in New York and expand its London operations.
In Britain, pension funds assets are worth 1.4 times more than the local equities market, while in Canada it is 1.2 times, BAML figures show. U.S. pension fund assets are almost equal to stock markets, at about $24.7 trillion apiece.
(Graphic: Pension assets vs market cap by country - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/AUSTRALIA-FUNDS-PENSIONS/0H001QEVL89H/eikon.png)
Analysts said pension funds' available assets have been one reason for the Australian market's performance this year. The benchmark S&P/ASX200 (AXJO) has risen 17.5% this year, according to Refinitiv data.
The US S&P500 has increased 18.82% during the same period, according to Refinitiv data.
CONSOLIDATION AND FEE PRESSURE
The continued growth of Australia's biggest funds - with some adding internal management teams - is also adding pressure on domestic fund managers.
This year, five pension funds have announced mergers, and industry experts expect more.
Ian Fletcher, head of research at investment advisory firm Chant West, said fund managers were discounting their fees as their pool of customers grows smaller in number but heftier in size.
""If you want to get mandates from Australian pensions you need to charge 5 to 10 basis points less than in overseas markets,"" Fletcher said.
Ian Macoun, the managing director of Pinnacle Investment Management, which has A$54.3 billion of assets under management according to the company's website, said domestic managers were suffering as super funds expanded and did more allocations on their own.
""There are definitely fee pressures from big super funds,"" he said. The only solution, he added, ""is to keep performing well."""

(Reuters) - A federal judge on Monday ordered  Facebook Inc  (O:FB) to face most of a nationwide lawsuit seeking damages for letting third parties such as Cambridge Analytica access users' private data, calling the social media company's views on privacy ""so wrong.""
While dismissing some claims, U.S. District Judge Vince Chhabria in San Francisco said users could try to hold Facebook liable under various federal and state laws for letting app developers and business partners harvest their personal data without their consent on a ""widespread"" basis.
He rejected Facebook's arguments that users suffered no ""tangible"" harm and had no legitimate privacy interest in information they shared with friends on social media.
""Facebook's motion to dismiss is littered with assumptions about the degree to which social media users can reasonably expect their personal information and communications to remain private,"" Chhabria wrote. ""Facebook's view is so wrong.""
A Facebook spokeswoman said the company considered protecting people's information and privacy ""extremely important,"" but believed its practices were consistent with its disclosures and ""do not support any legal claims.""
Lesley Weaver and Derek Loeser, two of the plaintiffs' lawyers, said in a joint statement that they were pleased with the decision, and ""especially gratified that the court is respecting Facebook users' right to privacy.""
The litigation followed a series of data privacy issues involving Menlo Park, California-based Facebook.
These included the 2015 breach that allowed Cambridge Analytica, a British political consulting firm, to access data for an estimated 87 million Facebook users. That breach was not revealed until March 2018.
In their 414-page complaint, users said Facebook misled them into thinking they could keep control over personal data, when in fact it let thousands of ""preferred"" outsiders such as Airbnb,  Lyft  (NASDAQ:LYFT) and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) gain access.
Chhabria faulted Facebook for treating privacy as an ""all-or-nothing"" proposition, where users would forfeit their privacy by sharing data even in a ""limited"" fashion.
He said Facebook had taken different positions elsewhere, including in a California case where it likened information kept on social media accounts to information stored on smartphones, where privacy concerns might be greater.
That position is ""closer to the truth than the company's assertions in this case,"" Chhabria wrote. ""Sharing information with your social media friends does not categorically eliminate your privacy interest in that information.""
The litigation covers Facebook users in the United States and United Kingdom whose information was shared with third parties without their consent since 2007.

The case is In re Facebook Inc Consumer Privacy User Profile Litigation, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 18-md-02843.

Huawei, which has been placed on a U.S. trade blacklist since May, had sued the Commerce Department and other U.S. government agencies for seizing its equipment in Alaska in 2017 en route back to China after a lab test in California.
Huawei said the U.S. government returned the equipment in August after confirming no export license was required and it decided to drop the suit.
It said the company was disappointed the U.S. government refused to provide a full explanation of what Huawei calls ""arbitrary and unlawful"" detention of the equipment for two years.
The fate of Huawei, the world's largest telecommunications equipment maker and a national icon in China, has become crucial in an escalating trade war between Beijing and Washington.
Huawei still faces multiple criminal charges in the United States for allegedly breaking U.S. export sanctions to countries including Iran. It is trying to challenge its addition to the U.S. National Defense Authorization Act in an ongoing lawsuit, which it says had restricted its business in the United States ""unconstitutionally"".
Washington says the Chinese company's telecoms gear could be used by Beijing to spy, an allegation Huawei has denied.

The Trump administration added Huawei to the so-called entity list in May, barring it from buying needed U.S. parts and components without U.S. government approval and threatening to disrupt its operations.

The package of rules, approved in a vote by the SEC, require brokerage firms to disclose potential conflicts of interests in the fees investors pay and the commissions brokers earn when giving financial advice.
The rules, which will be implemented by June 30, 2020, also require brokers to have a higher standard to meet a client's best interest when recommending stocks, mutual funds and other financial products.
In a filing in the U.S. District Court in the Southern (NYSE:SO) District of New York, the states of New York, California, Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, New Mexico, Oregon and the District of Columbia argued that the rule change is ""arbitrary and capricious.""
""Among the harms they will suffer, Plaintiffs will lose revenue from the taxable portions of distributions from their residents' investment and retirement accounts that are worth less because of expensive conflicts of interest in investment advice,"" the states wrote in the court filing.
The SEC did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The SEC's vote comes at the end of a 10-year battle over regulations on the investment advice industry. Last year, lobby groups successfully sued to overturn the similar fiduciary standard proposed by the Labor Department.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - California power provider PG&E Corp on Monday unveiled the outlines of a reorganization plan that will pay $17.9 billion for claims stemming from the wildfires that pushed it to seek bankruptcy protection.
The plan filed in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in San Francisco includes payments capped at $8.4 billion for wildfire victims, payments capped at $8.5 billion for reimbursing insurers that had paid victims and a $1 billion settlement with local governments.
The plan also would pay PG&E's debts in full and honor the company's contracts, including ones for buying renewable energy to help California meet its goals for cutting greenhouse emissions.

At the time, the company expected more than $30 billion in liabilities from wildfires in California in 2017 and 2018, including November's Camp Fire, the deadliest and most destructive wildfire of the state's modern history.
Lawyer Michael Kelly of Walkup, Melodia, Kelly & Schoenberger in San Francisco said wildfire victims like those he represents, including victims of the Camp Fire, will find what the plan offers them to be too little.
They also will be stunned that PG&E did not propose sacrifices from its bondholders or shareholders, Kelly said.
""It's not in any way, shape or form satisfactory or fair,"" Kelly told Reuters.
PG&E must file a detailed reorganization plan by Sept. 29, the day its so-called exclusive period for filing a Chapter 11 plan expires.
If PG&E resolves its bankruptcy by the end of June 2020, it will be able to participate in a recently enacted, $21 billion state fund to help California's investor-owned utilities pay for future wildfires liabilities.
The utilities would help support the fund with contributions. PG&E has said that taking part in the fund will enhance its finances over the long term.
According to the outline of its reorganization plan, PG&E will make a required $4.8 billion initial contribution to the fund.
PG&E said in a statement it expects its plans will include substantial equity financing, which may include a rights offering to existing shareholders, and that it aims to raise $14 billion to help pay wildfire victims and pay into the state fund.
Corporate reorganization plans generally need widespread support of creditors, and debtors can spend months getting the necessary backing.
PG&E will ultimately need to win approval for a reorganization plan from U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Dennis Montali, who has indicated he is willing to consider viable plans from other parties."
429,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 09, 2019 08:02PM ET</span>",U.S. congressional panel to probe court secrecy,"By Dan Levine and Lisa Girion
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - A U.S. House of Representatives subcommittee will hear testimony this month about a lack of transparency in the federal courts, with a focus on judges who routinely keep important evidence secret at the public's expense.
The hearing comes after a June 25 Reuters investigation (Read the Special Report https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-courts-secrecy-judges ) detailed how judges have allowed the makers of dozens of consumer products to file under seal in their courts information that is pertinent to public health and safety. As a result, hundreds of thousands of Americans have been killed or seriously injured by allegedly defective products -- drugs, cars, medical devices and other products -- while evidence that could have alerted consumers and regulators to potential danger remained hidden by the courts.
Representative Hank Johnson, a Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee, told Reuters in an interview Monday that court secrecy is a ""life and death"" issue, and that it causes people to lose confidence in the justice system.
It is rare for any party in a lawsuit to push for transparency. Corporations are loath to expose embarrassing internal communications, plaintiffs' lawyers don’t want to delay resolution for their clients, and judges want to keep cases moving on a crowded docket.
""Every judge should be aware that it's not just the parties that are litigating, but there is a public interest involved -- even if the only interest is the appearance that justice is taking place,"" said Johnson, chairman of the Subcommittee on Courts, Intellectual Property and the Internet, which oversees the federal courts.
A spokesman for the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts, which manages the federal court system, said: ""The judiciary has great respect for Chairman Johnson and always appreciates the opportunity to engage in a dialogue with his committee.""
Judges sealed evidence relevant to public health and safety in about half of the 115 biggest defective-product cases consolidated before federal judges over the past 20 years, Reuters found.
Information about the addictive nature of opioids was kept secret for years in courthouses across the United States, including nearly 2,000 cases grouped in multidistrict litigation before Judge Dan Polster in federal district court in Cleveland. An appeals court in June rebuked Polster over excessive secrecy in his court, and Polster has since allowed much more information from the case to become public.
Judges, including Polster, provided no explanation for allowing the secrecy in 85 percent of the cases where Reuters found health and safety information under seal -- despite being required to do so in most jurisdictions.
Johnson said the purpose of the congressional hearing, scheduled for Sept. 26, is to amplify the issue so judges will take action themselves to follow case law.

""If they don't, then legislation can commence,"" Johnson said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. House Judiciary Committee plans to hold hearings and seek documents into the Justice Department's decision to open an antitrust investigation into four major automakers' voluntary agreement with California to adopt compromise vehicle emissions requirements.
House Judiciary Chairman Jerrold Nadler and Representative David Cicilline, who chairs a subcommittee on antitrust issues, said in a joint statement late on Monday the probe of  Ford Motor Co  (N:F), Honda Motor Co (T:7267), BMW AG (DE:BMWG), and Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p) ""is only the latest in a profoundly troubling pattern of abuse of power that has flourished under the Trump presidency.""
The Justice Department declined to comment. The White House did not immediately comment. The automakers did not immediately comment.
The two House Democrats added ""there is virtually no antitrust theory that the Justice Department can use to prove that this agreement will unreasonably restrain trade or otherwise violate the antitrust laws.""
Reuters and other outlets reported Friday the existence of the investigation as the Trump administration has ramped up its opposition to automakers seeking to sidestep it on rolling back Obama-era fuel-efficiency rules.
The antitrust division sent Aug. 28 letters to the four automakers saying the government was concerned the agreement ""may violate federal antitrust laws"" but adding it had ""reached no conclusions,"" according to documents seen by Reuters.
In July, the four automakers said they had reached a deal to adopt standards that were lower than Obama-era rules but higher than the Trump administration's 2018 proposal.
The automakers were defying the Trump administration's effort to strip California of the right to fight climate change by setting its own standards.
Separately on Friday, general counsels at the Environmental Protection Agency told California Air Resource Board Chair Mary Nichols in a letter that its actions in connection with the voluntary agreement ""appear to be unlawful and invalid.""
Reuters reported on Thursday the administration was moving forward with plans to strip California of its waiver under the Clean Air Act to set its own vehicle emissions rules and requiring automakers to build an increasing number of zero-emission vehicles.

The Obama-era rules called for a fleetwide fuel efficiency average of 46.7 miles per gallon by 2026, compared with 37 mpg under the Trump administration's preferred option. The final regulation will modestly boost fuel efficiency over the preferred option's freeze of 2020 requirements but be far less than the Obama rules, Reuters reported on Thursday.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday proposed greater transparency for self-regulatory groups managing a trading database project aimed at preventing sudden and dramatic shifts in financial markets.
The regulator proposed the Consolidated Audit Trail (CAT) repository after the May 2010 ""flash crash"" and views it as critical to the oversight of markets where trading happens in tiny fractions of a seconds.
It will be a central database for all stock and options ""message traffic,"" meaning every trade order, execution, modification and cancellation, and hold sensitive personal identifying data such as the social security numbers of exchange customers.
The proposed changes also cover quarterly reports on the implementation of the project, the SEC said in a statement.
The SEC again extended the deadline for national securities exchanges to come up with plans on how they would comply with the project requirements. The exchanges had failed to meet implementation deadlines due to technical issues and worries about cybersecurity.
The original compliance timeline of November 2017 to November 2019 has been extended till between April 2020 and ending in December 2022, the SEC added.
The industry has complained that the SEC has not made clear who would pay for the project.
The SEC said the proposed changes were designed to ""decrease the likelihood of additional delays to CAT implementation by increasing operational transparency and attaching financial accountability.""
The platform would ideally track all trades from inception, pinpointing buyers, sellers, exchanges and brokers involved, and allow the SEC to better spot insider trading and market manipulation.

1. Apple) New IPhones in Focus
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) will take center stage tomorrow at 1 PM ET (17:00 GMT) when the tech giant is set to reveal its trio of iPhone 11s and other gadgets like a new version of the Apple Watch.
“Expected price points look to be $749 for the base iPhone, $999 for the iPhone 11 Pro, and $1,099 for the iPhone Pro Max,” Wedbush said. Any update on the upcoming launch of Apple TV+ - expected to go live in the early November – will also come into focus, Wedbush added. 
In the run-up to the event, however, some on Wall Street have opted for caution, with Piper Jaffray saying it expected ""limited excitement"" around this year's iPhones.
Apple shares (NASDAQ:AAPL) were up 0.31% on Monday. They're up 2.6% so far in September and 8.2% so far in the third quarter -- third best among the 30 Dow stocks, after   Home Depot   (NYSE:HD) and Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG).
Most on Wall Street are looking ahead to the launch of Apple's 5G phones next year, despite uncertainty about the upgrade cycle, Nomura said. 
""We believe many investors are looking ahead to the 2020 5G iPhone launches,"" Nomura said. ""IPhone estimates may be optimistic and that the shape of the 5G cycle remains uncertain.""
2. Labor Market Check
Just days after the data showed the U.S. economy created fewer jobs in August than expected, investor attention will turn to the Job Openings and Labor Turnover survey (JOLTs), which comes out at 10 AM ET.
Economists predict that the January JOLTs number fell slightly to 7.31 million last month from 7.48 million.
3. API Crude inventories
A fresh batch of petroleum data from the American Petroleum Institute due Tuesday, is expected to be closely watched to gauge whether the U.S. crude supplies will continue to slide, and support prices the rally in oil prices seen so far this month. 
The American Petroleum Institute last Tuesday reported crude oil stockpiles rose by 0.40 million barrels, though U.S. government data, released a day later, showed a third-straight weekly draw. 
Crude oil futures gained 2.4% to settle at $57.85 even as traders and investors concluded that newly appointed Saudi energy minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman would signal more aggressive efforts to curb oil output to support prices. 
Not everyone agreed, however. Wjile Abdulaziz bin Salman called on OPEC to continue output cuts, he said it would be wrong to preempt the meeting of OPEC and its allies. His comments ""are more or less market neutral,"" said Ole Hansen, head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank. "

Robbins, a politically impartial government employee, spearheaded May's negotiations on a deal with the European Union that would manage the country's departure from the bloc.
Though the sides succeeded in agreeing a Withdrawal Agreement last November, May repeatedly failed to garner enough domestic support for it to pass through Britain's parliament, and she resigned earlier this year.
Robbins, 44, has attracted criticism from prominent Brexit supporters who accused him of being too pro-EU.
But new Prime Minister Boris Johnson - who has himself said the deal would turn Britain into a ""vassal state"" - paid tribute to Robbins on Monday.
Robbins will first spend a sabbatical at the University of Oxford, becoming the first holder of a visiting fellowship set up in memory of former Cabinet Secretary Jeremy Heywood.
""I am delighted that Olly will be the first Permanent Secretary to take up this Fellowship in Jeremy Heywood's memory, which follows his many years of dedication to public service in a variety of different roles,"" Johnson said in a statement.
Robbins will then leave the civil service at the end of the fellowship to become a managing director in Goldman Sachs' Investment Banking Division.
He will join former European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso, who is the non-executive chairman of Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) International."
435,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 09, 2019 05:04PM ET</span>","Bloomberg, Goldman Sachs team up on foreign exchange analytics","By Elizabeth Dilts
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Bloomberg LLP is teaming up with  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS) to feature some of the investment bank's trading analytics on a new service the financial information company launched on Monday for foreign exchange trades made using algorithms.
Goldman is the first bank to have such a partnership with Bloomberg, and the tie-up will make its analytics visible on Bloomberg's terminal in FXGO, a global foreign exchange trading platform. Bloomberg is a competitor with Thomson Reuters for news and information services. 
Trading clients are demanding greater access to decision-making tools like Goldman's analytics, as the industry faces increasing pressure to cut costs, increase speed and prove that every trade is executed in the most efficient way possible. 
The new tool is aimed at breaking down barriers between companies that previously may not have worked together in this way, both companies said on Monday. 
""Historically, Bloomberg and Goldman might have liked to own the whole process independently,"" said Damien Vanderwilt, global head of Goldman's FICC execution services.
The partnership comes six years after tension between Bloomberg and big Wall Street banks, including Goldman, over its journalists accessing client data. (http://reut.rs/YQR02H)
The service on FXGO's execution manager allows clients to manage incoming orders and then to route those orders to liquidity providers, like Goldman. 
The benefit for Goldman this time around is that its trading clients who also use Bloomberg's terminal no longer have to log in to both systems to access both firms' analytics.
Vanderwilt called the new platform attractive to traders ""trying to reduce the number of systems that they need to operate in (on) any given trading day."" 
Goldman, which also offers equities execution services to clients of Bloomberg's Tradebook product, expects to gain new clients as Bloomberg's sales team markets the terminal and these new analytics tools. The bank declined to comment on business targets.
Bloomberg said it is open to similar partnerships with other banks, and that FXGO is open to any liquidity providers.
Tod Van Name, global head of FX electronic trading at Bloomberg, said that including the new analytics service on FXGO will give traders access to Goldman's proprietary analytics on liquidity and order execution in real time.

But there were struggles among big tech stocks as well as the defensive stocks that have led the market in recent weeks.
And the market pretty much stalled.
The S&P 500 was off slightly because of the tech weakness, which was more visible in the declines seen in the Nasdaq Composite, down 0.2%, and the Nasdaq 100 index, down 0.26%. The Dow, however, moved up 0.14% because of gains in its financial components, especially Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS).
The gains in financials reflected higher interest rates. The 10-year Treasury yield moved up to 1.646% from Friday's 1.55%.
Falls in Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO),   Intuit   (NASDAQ:INTU) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) were among the bigger decliners among tech stocks.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) were higher. And the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index climbed 0.8%, helped by Intel, Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN), Applied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT) and Broadcom NASDAQ:AVGO).
Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA),   Caterpillar   (NYSE:CAT), and chemical maker Dow led the Dow, along with Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM).
Energy stocks were buoyed by higher oil prices. West Texas Intermediate crude was up $1.33 to $57.85 a barrel. Brent oil futures crude rose $1.05 to $62.59.
The gains were prompted by Saudi Arabia's naming Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman, brother of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, as the new oil minister. He's expected to push for continuing production cuts among members of OPEC. Saudi Arabia has been trying to push global crude prices to $70 a barrel or higher to take of internal economic needs. 
Also pressuring oil prices -- and boosting energy stocks -- was Israeli Prime MInister Benjamin Netanyahu's claim that Iran has a secret nuclear weapons site. The claim raised Middle Eastern tensions.
Halliburton (NYSE:HAL), Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB), Apache (NYSE:APA) and Chesapeake Energy (NYSE:CHK) were among the bigger gainers.   Chevron   (NYSE:CVX) added nearly 1%.   Exxon Mobil   (NYSE:XOM) was up 0.8%.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks ended flat on Monday as increased expectations of stimulus from central banks around the world were offset by losses in technology and healthcare shares.
Investors also appeared to pull back from buying after the market posted solid increases last week, strategists said.  Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT) was the day's biggest drag on the S&P 500 and Nasdaq. 
The S&P 500 financial index (SPSY) was among the day's best-performing groups, rising 1.5%, with banks <.SPXBK> gaining 3.2% and U.S. Treasury yields up on rising bets of an interest rate cut at the U.S. Federal Reserve's September meeting.

""This is kind of the eye of the storm,"" as investors await more news on interest rates or trade, said Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Asset Management in Chicago.
But, he said, ""for the market to move significantly higher from here, we'd really need to see something happen on trade.""
Stocks rose last week largely on easing worries about U.S.-China trade negotiations.
This week, the European Central Bank is expected to introduce new stimulus measures at its meeting on Thursday.
""The market is absorbing those gains from last week, and ... is in a wait-and-see regarding the European Central Bank meeting,"" said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial (NYSE:PRU) in Newark, New Jersey.

Among other stocks, AT&T Inc (N:T) gained 1.5% after shareholder Elliott Management Corp disclosed a $3.2 billion stake in the company and pushed for changes.

438,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 09, 2019 04:33PM ET</span>",Argentines Make 7% Returns in Minutes Thanks to Capital Controls,"(Bloomberg) -- Argentines are beginning to find some benefits from the capital controls that President Mauricio Macri imposed earlier this month.
One system to circumvent the controls is paying a return of 7% in a matter of minutes, and its completely legal. The profit derives from the difference between the so-called “MEP dollar” -- which entails buying and selling bonds in different currencies -- and the official exchange rate.
“We are barely keeping up,” said Federico Grand, a trader at Guardati Torti SA, a grain broker in Ciudad de Rosario. There are customers who come in three times a day to carry out the operation, he added.
The only limit is the $10,000 monthly cap that the central bank imposed on dollar purchases by individuals. Some clients spent that entire limit last week alone, Grand said.
The official exchange rate that closed last week at 58 pesos per U.S. dollar, is significantly stronger than the “MEP dollar”, which stood at 62.35 per dollar on Friday. The differential, nicknamed “rulo“ by local traders, gives rise to generous profits and is similar to operations that were made during the capital controls under former President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner.
This is how it works, assuming the exchange rate is at 58 per dollar:
Step 1: A retail investor invests 58,000 pesos to obtain $1,000 in the bankStep 2: With the $1,000 in their pocket, the person asks their broker to buy Bonar 2024 bonds in the market at a price of $45.24 (assuming the Sept. 6 price)Step 3: Just a few minutes later, the person sells the securities and receives 62,344 pesos; the move would have allowed the person to make a 4,344 peso profit, which is equivalent to a return of 7.5% in dollar termsThe commission charged by the broker is 0.26% of the total amount or 150 pesos in this example, so the return is 7.25%.The question is, how long will the government maintain an operation that can be very generous with retail investors, but at the same time causes the central bank to lose reserves?

First, shareholders won an important legal victory after markets closed Sept. 6 that gave them renewed optimism of getting their hands on billions of dollars in company profits that now go to the government.
Then, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said early Monday that he will soon reach a deal that allows Fannie and Freddie to hold on to some of their earnings, so they can start rebuilding their capital buffers.
The step is considered crucial in eventually freeing the companies from federal control, which has been their status since the 2008 financial crisis. That’s because Fannie and Freddie are currently restricted from holding more than $3 billion in capital apiece, far short of what they would need to weather another housing crash as private companies.
Fannie jumped 43% to $3.88 in New York trading, the biggest one-day gain since November 2016. Freddie surged 43% to $3.67, also its biggest rise in almost three years.
Among investors benefiting from the gains are some of the biggest names in finance, including John Paulson, Bill Ackman’s Pershing Square (NYSE:SQ) Capital Management and Blackstone (NYSE:BX) Group Inc.
Read More: Fannie-Freddie Soar as Wall Street Hails Court Win, Mnuchin Plan
Treasury is “in the process of negotiating” a plan for Fannie and Freddie to retain earnings with the Federal Finance Housing Agency, Fannie and Freddie’s regulator, Mnuchin said Monday in an interview with Fox Business. “We expect a near-term agreement to retain their earnings,” he said.
Revamping Sweep
For Fannie and Freddie to hold on to their earnings, Treasury and FHFA would have to halt or revamp a controversial policy implemented in 2012 during the Obama administration, known as the net worth sweep, that requires the companies to send virtually all their profits to the Treasury.
Hedge funds and other investors that own Fannie and Freddie shares have long fought to end the sweep through litigation, claiming it was illegal. The shareholders won a big victory Sept. 6 when a panel of federal appeals court judges overturned a lower ruling that had backed the government’s right to take all of the mortgage giants’ profits.
Read More: Fannie-Freddie Investors Fighting Profit Sweep Get Key Win
The Fifth Circuit appeals court judges, based in New Orleans, also concluded last week that the structure of the FHFA is unconstitutional. Investors still face many hurdles, as the decision just kicks the case back to the lower court. Many other federal courts have ruled against the shareholders, making it more likely that an appeal could ultimately be heard by the Supreme Court if the case isn’t settled before then.
Litigating Shareholders
Fannie and Freddie don’t lend money to home buyers. Instead, they purchase mortgages from banks and other lenders and package them into bonds. Those securities have guarantees that protect investors from the risk of borrowers defaulting. Fannie and Freddie backstop nearly half of the U.S.’s $10 trillion of home loans, a process that keeps the mortgage market harming and borrowing rates low.
Fannie and Freddie were put into federal conservatorship in 2008 as the housing market cratered and were sustained by taxpayer aid. They have since started making money again and paid $115 billion more in dividends to the Treasury, through the net profit sweep, than they received in bailout funds.
Assuming that Fannie and Freddie would eventually released, hedge funds started buying their shares for pennies in the years after the crisis. Paulson & Co., Pershing Square and Blackstone Group’s GSO Capital were among those who got in on the trade.
Until now, shareholders have mostly suffered setbacks in their attempts to overturn the profits sweep. Their Sept. 6 win follows what also might be a watershed moment in Fannie and Freddie getting out of the government’s grip: the release of a Treasury report a day earlier that outlines the Trump administration’s plan to end the conservatorships.
Treasury Report
The Treasury document laid out dozens of suggested reforms to protect Fannie and Freddie from another housing crash, shrink their dominant market shares and create new competitors to the companies. Yet, it is only an initial step in what still would be a long and arduous road to freeing the companies from the government’s grip.
The Treasury Department’s proposal left much to be ironed out, signaling many of the suggested changes may not come until after the 2020 presidential election. And if a Democrat beats President Donald Trump next year, the overhaul would likely be scrapped all together.
Mnuchin said Monday that while he hopes to work with Congress to implement changes to Fannie and Freddie over the next three to six months, he is “perfectly comfortable” making administrative fixes if necessary. Only Congress can create competitors to Fannie and Freddie. But there is much the Trump administration can do on its own with FHFA, including ending the profit sweep.
If Fannie and Freddie start retaining earnings, it would still take them years to build up adequate capital to offset big losses. That’s why most officials believe the companies will also have to raise money through other means, such as share sales. In conservatorship, the companies lack of capital hasn’t been much of an issue because they have access to about $250 billion in Treasury funds.
Senate Hearing
The Treasury secretary will testify tomorrow on the administration’s plan before the Senate Banking Committee. Joining Mnuchin will be FHFA Director Mark Calabria and Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson.
The officials are expected to face aggressive push back for Democratic lawmakers, who are concerned that the administration’s proposals will do more to help hedge funds than assist consumers in getting loans, particularly lower-income buyers.

High-flying health-care shares led declines Monday, as some on Wall Street including Goldman’s Asad Haider sounded the alarm to a “potential onslaught of drug pricing headlines in the coming weeks following Congress’s August recess.” Megacap tech names also retreated. Stocks coveted for their high dividend yields, including real-estate and utility names, retreated as the 10-year rate topped 1.6%.
“The fact that we’ve had a bit of a reversal in the Treasury market has scared some of the momentum players,” said Charlie Smith, founding partner and chief investment officer at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh.
German bunds led the drop in sovereign debt, with yields on longer-dated notes climbing more than shorter-dated securities, as traders pared back expectations that the European Central Bank will unveil a big stimulus package this week. Rates on longer-dated Treasury notes climbed more than those on shorter-dated securities, reversing an inversion in the yield curve.
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said earlier that the U.S. and China have made “lots of progress” on trade talks.
“Trade sentiment is driving the market movements on the margin up and down,” Aaron Clark, portfolio manager at GW&K Investment Management, said by phone. “The commentary that we’ve heard over the past week or so, clearly markets have taken note of that and already priced some of that in.”
Elsewhere, oil advanced after Saudi Arabia’s new energy minister signaled that OPEC and its allies will continue with production cuts, as the group prepares to gather in Abu Dhabi.

442,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 09, 2019 04:07PM ET</span>",Goldman Leaders Court Saudis Over Aramco IPO After 1MDB Fallout,"(Bloomberg) --  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). is tapping its upper echelons to navigate a notoriously complicated region where it has stumbled of late: the Middle East.
After missing out on at least $25 billion in deals in Abu Dhabi -- the emirate that snubbed the U.S. bank for its involvement in the 1MDB scandal -- Goldman Sachs is making a push into Saudi Arabia.
Chief Executive Officer David Solomon -- the first chief of a Wall Street bank to visit the kingdom following the murder of government critic Jamal Khashoggi -- has turned to international banking head Richard Gnodde and former Donald Trump adviser Dina Powell to help lead the push. They’ve all spent months wooing top officials in Riyadh, vying for a slice of the world’s biggest initial public offering, people with knowledge of the matter said.
The charm offensive is paying off: the bank is considered one of the strongest contenders to get a lead role on Saudi Aramco’s mammoth offering. The deal promises to open the door to more lucrative mandates as the nation opens up to foreign investment and plans to privatize hundreds of state assets.
Difficult Market
Saudi Arabia is becoming the focus of Goldman Sachs’ Middle East strategy after the fallout from the 1MDB corruption scandal marked its abrupt downfall in Abu Dhabi, once one of its most lucrative markets in the region. Dealings with Qatar have become more complicated amid its diplomatic clashes with the kingdom. Global banks, including JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) & Co. and  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Group AG, are investing in Saudi Arabia as it promises some of the world’s biggest deals.
“Saudi Arabia is a goldmine of potential investment banking revenues for Goldman Sachs in the Middle East,” said Gary Dugan, chief executive officer of Singapore-based Purple Asset Management Pte. “They will need success on Aramco to offset the door closing in their face in Abu Dhabi.”
A spokesman for Goldman Sachs declined to comment.
Missed Deals
Goldman Sachs had been the go-to bank for many of Abu Dhabi’s top dealmakers, but has missed out on billions of dollars of deals after being sued by two of its investment funds. The bank is accused of misleading investors when it helped 1MDB raise $6.5 billion through bond deals in 2012 and 2013, while allegedly knowing that the funds would be misappropriated. The firm has denied culpability in the scandal and laid the blame on Tim Leissner, a former partner who has pleaded guilty.
Mubadala Investment Co. publicly blacklisted the bank earlier this year, while a number of local lenders and state bodies have informally stopped doing business with the bank, people with knowledge have said.
Goldman Sachs is being sidelined as Abu Dhabi, home to 6% of global oil reserves, is in the midst of a consolidation wave as the emirate tackles lower oil prices and slowing economic growth. The government is merging banks and sovereign funds, selling non-core assets and bringing in international investors into core sectors such as oil and gas -- all of which mean big business for banks.
The U.S. bank advised on the initial public offering of Abu Dhabi National Oil Co.’s retail distribution unit in 2017 that raised $851 million and worked with Mubadala on the planned $3 billion IPO of its Emirates Global Aluminium unit. It was also involved in a controversial deal to raise $1.2 billion in bonds for a cluster of airlines linked to Etihad Airways.
Despite the fallout, Goldman Sachs continues to speak with companies in Abu Dhabi and seek new business there, one of the people said.
In Saudi Arabia, Goldman Sachs’s top executives have been cultivating relationships for years.
While the bank joined rivals in canceling its attendance at the nation’s marquee conference last year, CEO Solomon in April became the first head of a global U.S. bank to travel to the kingdom to boost ties after Khashoggi’s killing and dismemberment at a consulate in Istanbul.
Investment banker Gnodde has been courting Saudi officials since Aramco first announced plans for the listing more than two years ago, and is managing the bank’s efforts in the kingdom, the people said.
When Egyptian-born Powell returned to Goldman Sachs last year after time in the Trump administration, the firm carved out a new role for her in the investment-banking division. She was tasked with courting large sovereign wealth funds, especially in the Gulf. Her appointment was notable because she had no prior banking experience and it wasn’t until this year that she completed the required exams for Wall Street bankers.
Powell started visiting the country in the run up to Aramco’s record debut bond issue, which Goldman Sachs helped manage, one of the people said. The Arabic speaker and former U.S. deputy national security adviser has played a key role in pitching for business using her deep connections in the Middle East, the people said.
On the Ground
Goldman Sachs has been building its presence in Saudi Arabia for some time, boosting headcount, securing a stock-trading license and getting involved in key deals including the kingdom’s first euro-denominated bond sale. The bank hired JPMorgan’s Mohammed Nazer to join its investment banking team in the kingdom, people said in July.
These efforts are yielding results. The bank is closing in on  HSBC Holdings  Plc (LON:HSBA) and JPMorgan that have for years dominated dealmaking in the kingdom. Goldman Sachs was the second top M&A adviser in the country last year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The bank advised petrochemical giant Saudi Basic Industries Corp. on its $69 billion sale to Aramco and is working on Riyad Bank’s merger with National Commercial Bank. It also advised on Saudi British Bank’s $5 billion combination with Alawwal Bank.
Still, operating Saudi Arabia isn’t without its risks. Investment banking fees are limited compared with other markets and the hype over deals masks a struggle to attract long-term foreign direct investments crucial to reduce the reliance on oil. While FDI more than doubled last year to about $3 billion, it remains well below the average level of the past decade.
That’s in part due to uncertainty over the government’s economic plans, human rights record and its 2017 declared crackdown on corruption, which ensnared hundreds of billionaires and businessmen. Questions also remain over whether Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman knew about or ordered Khashoggi’s killing, an allegation the kingdom denies.
“When you do business in emerging markets, your systems have to be much more robust,” said David Knutson, head of credit research for the Americas at Schroder Investment Management in New York. “If that level of vigilance doesn’t stay high when the money comes thick and fast, it can dull your sensitivity to risks. If you let your guard down, emerging market risks will haunt you for a long time.”"

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Attorneys general from 48 U.S. states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico have opened an antitrust probe into big tech companies that focuses on Alphabet's Google (O:GOOGL), Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton formally announced on Monday.
Paxton leads the probe, he said, which will focus on Google's advertising business. California and Alabama are not part of the investigation.
States on Monday formally requested documents from Google on its advertising business, Paxton said. Several of the attorneys general at the announcement in Washington described the investigation as ""preliminary"" but said they expected it would expand to cover other issues including data privacy.
Utah Attorney General Sean Reyes said the probe was ""for the benefit of the tech ecosystem to help level the playing field.""
Arkansas Attorney General Leslie Rutledge called Google's online search engine a ""juggernaut,"" and argued that a free search sometimes came at the cost of the freedom to choose the best products from the best companies.
The tech giants that were once praised as engines of economic growth with massive efficiencies have increasingly come under fire for allegedly misusing their clout in the market and lapses such as privacy breaches. 
U.S. President Donald Trump has called for closer scrutiny of social media firms and Google, accusing them of suppressing conservative voices online without presenting any evidence.
Google specifically has faced accusations that its web search service, which has become so dominant that it is now a verb, leads consumers to its own products at the cost of competitors. There have also been complaints of potentially anti-competitive behavior in how it runs the advertising side of its business. 
Google said in a statement on Friday that it would work constructively with them. It had no further comment on Monday. Its shares were down 0.6 percent in late trading.
Senator Josh Hawley, who as Missouri attorney general opened a Google probe in 2017, lauded the announcement on Monday as ""a very big day for the folks who care about antitrust enforcement.""
""I hope that Congress will get serious about acting. And I hope the United States Senate will lead the way there,"" he said.
Separately, a second group of state attorneys general, led by New York, is focusing on  Facebook Inc  (O:FB), it was announced on Friday.
The social media platform, which owns one-time rivals Instagram and WhatsApp and has more than 1.5 billion daily users, has been criticized for allowing misleading posts and so-called ""fake news"" on its service. Will Castleberry, Facebook's vice president for state and local policy, said last week that the company would cooperate with state attorneys general.
One criticism of Facebook is that it has been slow to clamp down on hate speech, and it recently paid a $5 billion settlement for sharing 87 million users' data with the now-defunct British political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica. The consultancy's clients included Trump's 2016 election campaign.
On the federal level, the Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission are probing Facebook, Google, Apple (O:AAPL) and Amazon (O:AMZN), also for potential violations of antitrust law.
Google's parent Alphabet said on Friday the Department of Justice in late August requested information and documents related to prior antitrust probes of the company. The company added in a securities filing that it expects similar investigative demands from state attorneys general, and that it is cooperating with regulators.
Amazon, the world's biggest online retailer, has been accused of unfair tactics with third-party sellers on its website, who must pay for advertising to compete against first-party and private label sales by Amazon itself.
Apple has come under fire from app developers over practices like making only iPhone apps available through its official App Store. The music-streaming app Spotify (N:SPOT) has alleged that App Store policies make it difficult to compete against Apple Music for paid subscribers.
State attorneys general have fewer resources than the federal agencies but have been known to team up to take on even giant corporations.

Most recently, 43 states and Puerto Rico sued Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd (N:TEVA) and 19 other drugmakers in May, accusing them of scheming to inflate prices and reduce competition for more than 100 generic drugs.

“We are in the process of negotiating with FHFA, we expect a near-term agreement to retain their earnings,” Mnuchin said early Monday on Fox Business, referring to talks with the Federal Housing Finance Agency.
Mnuchin said he aims for the mortgage giants to retain their earnings as soon as this month and that the money would not go back to investors but remain with the companies.
In a proposal released Thursday, Mnuchin’s agency laid out dozens of suggested reforms to protect Fannie and Freddie from another housing crash, shrinking their dominant market shares and creating new competitors to the companies that backstop about $5 trillion of home loans. Yet, it is only an initial step in what still would be a long and arduous road to freeing the companies from the government’s grip.
The Treasury Department’s proposal left much to be ironed out, signaling there might not be a windfall unless President Donald Trump wins re-election in 2020. That sentiment was palpable on Wall Street Friday with Fannie and Freddie suffering their biggest one-day drops since January.
Mnuchin said Monday that while he hopes to work with Congress to implement changes to Fannie and Freddie over the next three to six months, he is “perfectly comfortable” making administrative fixes if necessary.

They have since returned to profitability and paid $115 billion more in dividends to the Treasury than they received in bailout funds. Since 2013, nearly all of their profits have been sent to the Treasury under a policy called the “net-worth sweep.”
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac investors won a big victory in their long battle to reap benefits from their stakes in the mortgage giants with a court ruling letting them pursue claims that the U.S. sweep of the companies’ earnings is illegal.
A panel of federal appeals court judges in New Orleans overturned a ruling that backed the government’s right to take all of the mortgage giants’ profits. The judges also concluded that the structure of Fannie and Freddie’s regulator, the FHFA, is unconstitutional because of job protections for the agency’s director."

The current odds are not in favor of gaming stocks, which have seen activity stutter in the key gambling region Macau, pressured by the Hong Kong protests and ongoing U.S.-China trade. But for  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), the weakness in the region creates an ""attractive"" long-term entry, with the bank upgrading  Las Vegas Sands  to buy from hold, sending Las Vegas Sands (NYSE:LVS) more than 2% higher. 
A little over a week ago, data showed gross gaming revenues in Macau fell in August for the second straight month. Gaming revenues from Macau, the world’s largest gambling hub, declined 8.6% in August year-on-year. 
As well as the ongoing U.S.-China trade war and protests in Hong Kong, competition from Asian casino operators in Macau has also kept a lid on growth for U.S. gambling companies. 
Against the backdrop of headwinds in Macau, U.S. gaming companies have found a semblance of support in the expansion of U.S. sports betting following the repeal – in May last year – of the Professional and Amateur Sports Provision Act of 1992, which paved the way for individual states to introduce legislation permitting sports betting.

This is what’s coming, on a day that saw the pound rally to the highest level against the dollar since July, before paring gains after House of Commons Speaker John Bercow announced he was stepping down.
Before 7.15 p.m.: Document Release
An emergency debate aimed at forcing the government to release details on
its no-deal Brexit planningdiscussions that took place ahead of the decision to suspend parliament for so long Since Johnson expelled 21 Conservative members of parliament, he’s a long way short of having a majority, and he’s likely to lose.

In the final debate of the evening, Johnson will make a second attempt to get Parliament to vote for a snap general election. He needs two-thirds of MPs -- 434 of them -- to vote for this. Last week he got 298, and there’s no reason to think he’ll get any closer this week.
Johnson could make a statement after the second vote. When that business has finished, Parliament will be “prorogued,” in a ceremony involving a statement from Queen Elizabeth II being read in the upper House of Lords. Parliament will be suspended.
If all goes as expected, on the six votes that Johnson has tried to win in Parliament since becoming prime minister, he will have been defeated every time."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Magic realism is a literary genre in which narrative is shot through with surreal, dreamlike, seemingly impossible moments.
If famed author Salman Rushdie is a dean of the genre, perhaps it is not surprising that his life exhibits so many similar traits.
To wit, the struggling young writer penned the classic “Midnight’s Children,” which would go on not only to win the prestigious Booker Prize, but the “Booker of Bookers,” which pit previous champions against each other.
Then came the fatwa against him in the aftermath of “The Satanic Verses,” a death sentence from some Islamic authorities, which threw him into daily danger and consumed years of his life.
The longtime U.S. resident is now enjoying a new high, with his new book “Quichotte” short-listed for another Booker Prize. As part of Reuters Life Lessons series, we sat down with the 72-year-old author to discuss his life on and off the page.
Below are edited excerpts from the interview.
Q: As a young writer starting out, what was the money situation like?
A: I was broke most of the time. In those days in the UK, you could get a part-time job at an ad agency and work two or three days a week. ""Midnight’s Children"" took five years to write, and I paid the bills by working at Ogilvy & Mather.
Q: What was it like to go from scraping by, to being a smash?
A: It was completely unexpected. I wasn’t even sure who would publish it. When it did come out, even then I didn’t expect it to become a global bestseller. That changed my life, and I was so grateful. It gave me the ability to sit at home and work, which for a writer is almost a miracle.
Q: Did you make any money mistakes, once you became a success?
A: I’ve always been quite sensible about money. I didn’t buy any fast cars, for instance – I bought an ordinary Citroen. Even if I had the money, I never wanted a Lamborghini. I don’t have extravagant tastes, and I never have had.
Q: With the fatwa, what did you learn about enduring in an impossible situation?
A: Until you’re placed in a position like that, of extreme pressure, you don’t really know how you are going to react. It’s impossible to know in advance. What I learned about myself is that I was able to endure, and fight back, and come out on the other end, and not be crazy. That was a surprise to me. Everyone has a resilience that you might not suspect yourself of having.
Q: Some of your philanthropic money has been devoted to school lunches in South Africa – why is that?
A: A friend of mine started a charity called The Lunchbox Fund, which gives a healthy midday meal to schoolkids in the poorest areas of South Africa. Truancy rates in the townships had been very high. If you tell students they are going to have a big lunch, then they stay in class and get an education. It’s an impressively simple idea.
Q: What life lessons do you try to pass on to your own children?
A: Kindness and hard work. Fortunately for me, both of my sons are very kind and are working hard at things they love. Neither of them followed in my footsteps, though. They are carving out lives for themselves that are anything but literary.
My oldest son has a public relations and event management firm, and my younger son is completing a diploma in music production and sound engineering. That’s where they are passionate.
Q: Since we are in unique times, both in the U.S. and the UK, any lessons to be learned from these strange political moments?
A: With Brexit, I’ve always been strongly against it. I would love to feel that this juggernaut heading off the edge of a cliff can still be stopped. Maybe it can’t be, but I live in hope.
As for Trump, I feel the way for the country to regain its real self is to defeat him. I dread to think what would happen if he were re-elected. Next November will be a real turning point in the U.S. People will have to decide what kind of country they want to live in."

Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said Friday the central bank would ""act as appropriate"" to sustain economic expansion, comments that most took as accepting the need for another quarter-point interest rate cut at the Fed's policy meeting this month.
The Fed cut its target Fed funds rate for the first time since 2008 in July, setting a new range between 2% and 2.25%. Bets on another cut rose after data on Friday showed the U.S. economy added fewer jobs than expected in August, although wage growth remained robust in a tight labor market.

(Reuters) - U.S. prosecutors have charged a Chinese professor with fraud for allegedly taking technology from a California company to benefit Huawei, in another shot at the embattled Chinese telecommunications equipment maker. 
Bo Mao was arrested in Texas on Aug. 14 and released six days later on $100,000 bond after he consented to proceed with the case in New York, according to court documents.
He pleaded not guilty in U.S. district court in Brooklyn on Aug. 28 to a charge of conspiring to commit wire fraud. 
According to the criminal complaint, Mao entered into an agreement with the unnamed California tech company to obtain its circuit board, claiming it was for academic research. 
The complaint, however, accuses an unidentified Chinese telecommunications conglomerate, which sources say is Huawei, of trying to steal the technology, and alleges Mao played a role in its alleged scheme. A court document also indicates the case is related to Huawei. 
Mao, an associate professor at Xiamen University in China, became a visiting professor at a Texas university last fall. He first gained attention as part of a Texas civil case between Huawei and Silicon Valley startup CNEX Labs Inc. 
In December 2017, Huawei brought a lawsuit against CNEX and a former employee, Yiren Huang, claiming theft of trade secrets. Huang, a former engineering manager at a U.S. Huawei subsidiary, helped start CNEX in 2013 three days after leaving the company. 
In a counterclaim, CNEX said Mao had asked for one of its circuit boards for a research project and that, after it sent the board to the professor, he used it for a study tied to Huawei. 
That case ended in June with a ""take nothing"" judgment. 
A jury did not find CNEX stole trade secrets from Huawei but decided Huang violated his employment contract by not notifying Huawei of patents he obtained within a year of leaving. However, the jury found Huawei was not harmed and did not award any damages.
The jury did find Huawei misappropriated CNEX trade secrets but awarded no damages on that claim, either. 
Now, U.S. prosecutors, who have an case against Huawei in Brooklyn for alleged bank fraud and Iran sanctions violations, have revived the CNEX case.
Although Huawei has not been charged, the company said it views the case against Mao as the U.S. government's latest instance of ""selective prosecution.""
""U.S. federal prosecutors are charging forward with CNEX's allegations,"" a Huawei spokesman said in a statement, adding that prosecutors had shown no interest in Huawei's claims against CNEX.
The spokesman noted the United States was charging Mao, even though the professor was never sued by CNEX and never called to testify at the civil trial.
A hearing in the criminal case against Mao is scheduled for Wednesday in Brooklyn federal court.  
A spokesman for the U.S. Attorney's office in Brooklyn declined to comment, as did a lawyer for Mao, a CNEX spokesman, and a lawyer for Huang. 
Huawei says the U.S. government has made a concerted effort to discredit the company and curb its industry leadership. 
In January, U.S. prosecutors charged Huawei with stealing robotic technology from T-Mobile US Inc (O:TMUS). Huawei, which has pleaded not guilty, has said the companies settled their disputes in 2017. 
The same day, the Justice Department unsealed a bank fraud indictment in Brooklyn that accused Huawei of misleading global banks about its business in Iran. The company has pleaded not guilty in that case as well. 
The United States has also lobbied other governments to ban Huawei equipment, and banned companies from supplying Huawei with U.S. components without special licenses, ratcheting up tension between China and the United States as they engage in a tit-for-tat trade war. 

A Justice Department spokesman said last week that while the department does not comment on specific investigations, it complies with the law and all subjects ""enjoy the same rights to due process afforded by our Constitution and safeguarded by an independent judiciary.”

PARIS (Reuters) - Shares in Air France-KLM (PA:AIRF) fell sharply on Monday after a French minister named Air France as a bidder for bankrupt carrier Aigle Azur, which left 19,000 passengers stranded after abruptly halting operations.
The French unit confirmed it had bid for all or part of Aigle Azur - without saying which - as rival Easyjet announced it had expressed interest in some operations of the budget carrier, which was placed under bankruptcy protection on Sept. 2.
The Franco-Dutch carrier's stock had fallen as much as 9.6% earlier in the day after junior transport minister Jean-Baptiste Djebbari said the group ""appears to want to make an offer"" for Aigle Azur.
The budget carrier's two biggest shareholders are China's HNA Group, with around an 48% stake, and Brazilian entrepreneur David Neeleman with a 32% holding.
Higher fuel costs and stiffer low-cost competition have led to a wave of bankruptcies among smaller European airlines in the past three years, including Air Berlin, Germania, British-based Monarch, Latvia's Primera Air and Swiss SkyWork.
Aigle Azur's difficulties were compounded by its over-expansion from medium-haul services focused on Algeria into long-haul destinations such as Brazil.
The French state, keen to drum up interest and save Aigle Azur's 1,200 jobs, had also flagged potential bids from Air Caraibes parent Dubreuil Group and an investor group led by Lionel Guerin, former head of Air France's Hop! unit.
French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said on Friday that a ""principal offer"" for Aigle Azur was being considered. The bankrupt carrier's works council was due to meet on Monday afternoon to consider the offers received.
Government influence over Air France-KLM, in which France holds a 14.3% stake, added to investor concern that had driven its shares 8.7% lower by 1214 GMT, with one trader telling Reuters the state was ""likely to push them to get involved"".
Officials turned to Air France-KLM as early as April, after Aigle Azur sought help from a government agency, according to financial daily Les Echos. Its interest was piqued after the struggling carrier discussed selling take-off and landing slots at Paris Orly to Spain's Vueling, the paper reported.
Air France has scrambled extra Algeria flights to help repatriate the 13,000 Aigle Azur passengers still stranded by the collapse. Most will have reached their destinations by the end of the week, the junior transport minister said."

471,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 09, 2019 09:02AM ET</span>","America’s Top Car Dealer Is Down on Nissan, Says Musk Needs Help","(Bloomberg) -- Cheryl Miller, the chief executive officer of AutoNation Inc (NYSE:AN)., has been on the job less than two months, but she’s summoning 20 years of automotive experience to navigate softening auto sales, technology disruption and trade wars.
Miller, 47, is the first woman to run the largest automotive retailer in the U.S. and one of the few female senior executives in a still male-dominated industry. Previously the CFO of AutoNation, Miller was promoted to the position in July following Executive Chairman Mike Jackson’s ouster of his initial successor, Carl Liebert, after just four months.
She spoke with Bloomberg News on Sept. 5 about President Donald Trump’s trade tweets, Nissan Motor Co.’s struggle to rehabilitate its brand, whether Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc. needs traditional dealerships and her experience as a woman working in the auto industry. The discussion has been edited and condensed for clarity.
Q: What’s your take on Nissan, which has seen shrinking U.S. sales volumes?
A: Nissan certainly has had its issues with incentives, which we’ve spoken about publicly before, and we’ve decreased substantially our position in Nissan.
Think about it from a consumer lens: If I draw the lucky straw, and I get the incentive, my vehicle costs $5,000 less than my neighbor’s vehicle. How does that feel from a brand perspective? And people look at the dealer.
We have a smaller Nissan footprint today than we did two years ago, and five years ago.
This isn’t just specific to Nissan, but if you have brand damage, sometimes it takes time to sort it out.
Q: Are you revisiting your lower-inventory strategy as interest rates head lower?
A: When customers come in to a dealership now, the average monthly payment on a new vehicle is $550 a month. The last time they might have been in the market -- call it three, five, seven years ago -- interest rates were effectively zero and the prices were multiple points lower than they are today.
The rate cut that we just had, followed by the potential for another 25 basis-point cut, or maybe more of a 50 basis-point cut, that’s helpful. And that kind of basis-point decline -- compared to a 75 basis-point increase last year -- will help provide some additional tailwind.
Q: Will buyers ever revert to favoring sedans over SUVs?
A: People like the command seating position of a SUV. So once people get into those, and with fuel prices where they are, it’s been relatively sticky demand. I don’t see an immediate reversal of that trend. I think with fracking, the advent of some other technologies, and also just the improvement in fuel economy of combustion engine vehicles, I think that trend will be pretty sticky.
Q: How has AutoNation been impacted by Trump Administration tariff policy?
A: The proposed Nafta replacement, USMCA, was a good outcome. We’re keeping an eye on the European side to see where things go there with threatened tariffs, and we do not import any parts directly from China, not directly. But the automotive industry is, and would continue to be, somewhat impacted by it. What’s challenging is just the variability around the news cycle. But we’re continuing to monitor it and we feel good, given our multiple business lines, about our relative position.
Our manufacturer partners have got some great pros at the top. Some of these people navigated through the Great Recession. When you’ve managed through those things, you’ve got some battle scars and you’re pretty agile.
The manufacturers have proven to be relatively resilient. I can’t say that at every moment in time we agree with all their decisions, but at the end of the day, this is about the U.S. consumer and the U.S. voter. Are these things good or bad for those people? I think that’s the lens to consider.
Q: What do you make of Tesla’s direct-to-consumer sales model?
A: With Tesla not having retailers, I’m not sure how well that’s served them in their service model. They can’t handle trade-ins, for example. From a customer value proposition, there’s some benefits to having retailers.
Is their core competency retail? Is their core competency servicing vehicles?
Q: How important is being female to the value you bring as CEO?
A: It’s important. It’s not just gender.
The hidden secret about me is that I’m part Puerto Rican. Do you understand and resemble the communities that you serve?
So when I think about AutoNation, we’re coast-to-coast. Our regional president for the western U.S. happens to be Asian. So I think it reflects an understanding of your customer base. I like that element of diversity."

PRAGUE (Reuters) - Security concerns in Poland and the Czech Republic over telecoms equipment made by Huawei Technologies have not had a significant business impact despite creating uncertainty, a deputy head of central Europe and the Nordics said.
A warning from the Czech cybersecurity watchdog that Huawei's technology could pose a security threat and Poland's arrest of a Chinese Huawei employee and a former Polish security official on spying allegations have put it under pressure.
""It is pretty much business as usual with a little bit more attention to show that we are transparent, open and inclusive and we have nothing to hide,"" Radoslaw Kedzia, Huawei's vice president of central Europe and the Nordics, told Reuters.
There had been no ""no significant impact"" on business or major strategy shifts in the region since the concerns surfaced in December, Kedzia said, adding that Huawei is contacting governments and customers when security fears arise.
Huawei's 2018 annual report showed it raised revenue in the Czech Republic to CZK 7.65 billion ($327 million) in 2018 from CZK 6.63 billion in 2017 and increased net profit to CZK 159.4 million from CZK 97.1 million in 2017.
The United States has led a global campaign to convince allies to ban the world's top telecommunications equipment supplier from next generation 5G mobile networks.
Huawei denies U.S. government allegations that it is able to spy on customers, has violated U.S. sanctions on Iran and stolen American intellectual property.
'PRAGUE PROPOSALS'
Last week Poland and the United States also urged tougher checks on foreign influence over 5G networks in a joint declaration by U.S. Vice President Michael Pence and Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki.
Kedzia said Huawei did not have a problem with this and its reference to the ""Prague Proposals"" on 5G security formulated by security experts in May, saying it complied fully.
The security issue is crucial because of 5G's leading role in internet-connected products ranging from self-driving cars and smart cities to augmented reality and artificial intelligence. If underlying technology for 5G connectivity is vulnerable, it could allow hackers to spy on or disrupt them.
Europe — where Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, the Netherlands, Lithuania and Portugal are all preparing to auction 5G licenses this year — has emerged as a key battleground for Huawei's technology.
Following the Czech cybersecurity warning, the government canceled some tenders that included Huawei, which has since won contracts from other customers including public institutions like Czech Television or the finance ministry.
""There is a level of uncertainty at the moment,"" Kedzia said. ""The level of uncertainty goes out to our customers as well. Some of them hesitate. Some of them say - you know what, I will help you guys, I will give you more orders.""
""On one hand, we are under pressure and we suffer, on the other hand we are confident (that) we are going to go through it and we will become stronger."""

Saudi officials made initial contact with some top business families on behalf of the oil giant, the people said, asking not to be identified because the information is private. Aramco may hold more formal meetings as early as next week after banks have been hired for the sale, three of the people said.
The kingdom is aiming to raise at least 1% to 2% of Aramco from these investors, according to one of the people. The amount each family invests will likely hinge on the company’s valuation, another person said.
Saudi Arabia is turning to its wealthiest families to ensure there’s enough demand for what could be the biggest initial public offering. The kingdom’s economy is struggling to shake off the impact of lower oil prices and a 2017 purge that ensnared dozens of billionaires and officials. The crackdown undermined business confidence and prompted many billionaires to consider shifting some of their fortune abroad.
A spokesman for Aramco wasn’t immediately able to comment.
Some of the families that have been approached had relatives briefly held in the Ritz-Carlton hotel in Riyadh as part of the purge, which the government called an anti-corruption crackdown, one of the people said. They aren’t, however, being forced to invest, that person said.
Anchor investors usually commit to buying shares in a company before an IPO is opened up to other investors to control pricing and ensure that the sale is successful.
Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman, the architect of the IPO plan, has said he expects Aramco to be valued at over $2 trillion, but analysts see $1.5 trillion as more realistic. The company aims to select underwriters this week and is considering selling shares on the Saudi stock exchange this year or early next, with a potential international listing at a later date, Bloomberg News has reported.
Selling a stake in Aramco is a key part of the prince’s blueprint to wean Saudi Arabia off its reliance on oil, with the proceeds expected to be invested back into the economy. Plans for the IPO were put on hold last year as Aramco focused on the $69 billion acquisition of a majority stake in Saudi Basic Industries Corp.
As preparations for the IPO gather pace, the kingdom named the head of its sovereign wealth fund as Aramco chairman, replacing Khalid Al-Falih, who was also later removed as energy minister."
477,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 09, 2019 08:02AM ET</span>",Big Ag wants a cut of booming fake-meat market,"By Rod Nickel and Tom Polansek
WINNIPEG, Manitoba/CHICAGO (Reuters) -  Bunge  Ltd, one the world's biggest grain traders, recently disclosed the 1.6% stake it had purchased in the fast-growing fake-meat startup Beyond Meat.
The play looked smart after the stock surged more than 250% since the faux burger and sausage maker's initial public offering in May. Indeed, Beyond Meat's (O:BYND) market capitalization of $9.9 billion is now larger than Bunge's (N:BG), a 201-year-old firm with 31,000 employees.
No wonder many top agricultural firms want to grab their cut of the booming market for plant-based fake meat. Bunge's investment is just one example of how grain traders and seed companies are trying to capitalize on a market that now accounts for 5% of U.S. meat purchases - a share expected to triple over a decade, according to investment management firm Bernstein. That growth would mirror the fast ramp-up of milk substitutes made from crops such as almonds.
""I definitely think this is going to continue to drive demand,"" said Vince Macciocchi, president of the nutrition group at Archer Daniels Midland (N:ADM), one of Bunge's chief rivals.
ADM and privately-held grain trader Cargill are selling processed peas and soy proteins to consumer food companies and restaurants that use them to make vegetable burgers, sausages, fish substitutes and other faux-meat products. They are also getting into the business through acquisitions and corporate partnerships or by leveraging their labs and research capabilities to help make new plant-based products for clients including food and beverage makers.
Seed company  Corteva  (N:CTVA) - which spun off in June after a merger of  Dow Chemical  (NYSE:DOW) and Dupont (N:DD) - is studying potential vegetable seed offerings.
Grain traders and seed-makers are following the lead of Beyond Meat and another startup, Impossible Foods, along with traditional meat producers such as  Tyson Foods  (N:TSN) and Maple Leaf Foods (TO:MFI) that have cashed in on plant-based meat substitutes. Demand for meat alternatives has soared as consumers add plant-based protein to their diets for health reasons and out of concern for animal welfare and environmental damage from livestock farming.
Tofu, made from soybean milk, is the best known meat alternative and has been around for decades. But in recent years, other crops such as black beans, peas, lentils, canola, beets and sunflower have become popular in products made to taste like or replace meat.
The big agricultural firms are in part playing defense. Grain traders supply the world's livestock farms with animal feed - a business that would suffer if fake meat sales rise at the expense of real meat. Seed companies such as  Bayer AG  (DE:BAYGn) sell to farmers who grow the corn and soybeans that are now sold mostly to feed livestock.
SURGING DEMAND
ADM this year created a new position - director of ""flexitarian"" solutions - to focus on developing products for food companies who are targeting the market for a mostly plant-based diet, Macciocchi said. The company is also considering repurposing an animal-feed plant in Rotterdam to produce human-grade soy products, he said. ADM has expanded its plant-protein team of scientists and marketers in the past three years even as it aims to cut its overall workforce.
""We've dedicated a significant amount of our team - the technical side of our team, as well as the commercial side of our team - to plant-based proteins,"" Macciocchi said.
Cargill (CARG.UL) in August announced an additional $75 million investment in North American pea-protein producer Puris - which supplies Beyond Meat. That triples its original $25 million investment in January 2018.
Cargill's customers have been clamoring for pea or soy protein products, including alternative meats, said Laurie Koenig, who leads a Cargill unit developing such items.
""We've never seen this kind of pull before from the market,"" Koenig said.
Like ADM and Cargill, Bunge is now looking to supply ingredients to startups and large companies involved in the imitation-meat trend, Bunge CEO Greg Heckman said in an interview.
""There's just so many ways that it is touching our business,"" he said.
SEEDS OF A NEW MARKET
Seed developer Corteva has discussed expanding into research or small acquisitions in vegetable seeds in part to take advantage of increasing demand for plant-based proteins, Chief Executive Jim Collins told Reuters. Corteva's ability to research breeding and genetics of corn and soybean crops could be applied to vegetables, he said.
""The whole vegetable-seed industry is interesting to me,"" Collins said.
Rival Bayer also could enter the market as a provider of plant-based meat alternatives, an executive said in August, without providing details. The company, which sells seeds and farm chemicals, said it also offers products for plant-based protein sources such as soybeans, tree nuts and peas.
Toronto-based pork processor Maple Leaf two years ago bought U.S.-based Lightlife Foods, a plant-based burger-maker, to expand its reach into a market with boundless potential, chief executive Michael McCain said. While the trend is starting in North America and Europe, it will expand worldwide within a decade, McCain said.
Marfrig Global Foods SA (SA:MRFG3) is making a plant-based burger for the Brazil market - made from soy supplied by ADM, and sold at Burger King starting in November.
ADM is building a pea protein plant in North Dakota, while France's Roquette and Verdient Foods, backed by Hollywood director James Cameron, are building plants in Manitoba and Saskatchewan respectively.
Fake meat makers largely rely on soy, wheat, and peas, according to the Good Food Institute, which promotes the alternatives. But a wide variety of other crops play a role, presenting an opportunity for companies that maintain relationships with farmers.
In a Winnipeg, Manitoba laboratory that doubles as a kitchen, a Burcon NutraScience (TO:BU) food scientist grills black bean burger patties that are held together with canola protein, rather than the usual eggs - making such burgers appealing to vegans. The company makes protein ingredients from canola, pea and soy, and business is brisk.
""The plant-protein industry is as hot as it's ever been,"" said Burcon vice-president Martin Schweizer."

On Friday, U.S. jobs growth slowed more than expected in August, while data over the weekend from China showed the country's exports unexpectedly shrank in August as shipments to the U.S. slowed.
The two countries have been locked in a trade dispute since early 2018, and investors fear escalating tariffs between them -- already curtailing growth -- might tip the global economy into recession as early as next year.

Tobacco stocks were also likely to be in focus after the Center for Disease Control and Prevention warned late on Friday that vaping products may be responsible for a wave of sudden and acute health problems.
There was also more buzz around the upcoming IPO of The We Company, the parent company of office rental group WeWork. A report by Dow Jones suggested that the company may cut its valuation to less than $20 billion at the IPO, even less than reported at the end of last week. The deal shines a harsh light on the 'unicorns' that have lined up to list this year, many of whom still don't have a clear path to profitability.

ABU DHABI (Reuters) - ACWA Power plans to focus more on renewable energy projects, lifting their share of its portfolio to 70% over the next decade, its chief executive and president said on Monday.
The current value of the Saudi Arabian utility developer’s portfolio is more than $42 billion, with renewables accounting for 23%.
“By 2030, we expect to see 70% of renewables in our portfolio in terms of capital employed,” Paddy Padmanthan told Reuters in an interview at the World Energy Congress.
“We expect to see, in any given year, 60% of new investments in renewables.”
Acwa Power, which develops power and desalinated water plants, plans to expand into new markets, but will maintain its portfolio balance of 50% in Saudi Arabia and 50% overseas. 
The company has assets in 12 countries and has bid for renewable energy projects in five new countries – Ethiopia, Tunisia, Cambodia, Azerbaijan and Uzbekistan. 
“We are responding to demand, seeking growth and seeking a balance,” Padmanthan said.
Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund, the Public Investment Fund (PIF), which already holds a 25% stake in Acwa, plans to increase its stake to 40%, Acwa’s managing director, Yasir al-Rumayyan, said in February.
Padmanthan said plans for an initial public offering (IPO) remained, with banks still working with Acwa. 
“First, the PIF stake increase has to be done, we are working on broadening the shareholder base in readiness to go to the public,” he said, declining to give a timeline. "

LONDON (Reuters) - Deutsche Boerse's Eurex Clearing arm said on Monday it was scrapping booking fees for customers that want to switch clearing in over-the-counter derivatives to the Frankfurt operator before Britain leaves the European Union.
Most euro-denominated derivatives traded off-exchange, such as interest rate swaps, are cleared by the London Stock Exchange's LCH unit. Britain's scheduled departure from the EU has prompted calls from euro zone policymakers for it to move to the EU.
""The incentive program of Eurex Clearing provides for a 100% discount on booking fees for portfolio switches in over-the-counter interest rate derivatives to Eurex Clearing until end of 2019,"" Eurex said in a statement.
In January 2018, Eurex introduced a ""partnership program"" to reward customers, similar to a longstanding scheme at LCH, but so far it has not made much of a dent in LCH's market share.
The German operator said on Monday that regulators and central banks have recently renewed their call on market participants to prepare for all Brexit scenarios.
Britain's is due to leave the bloc on Oct. 31 but has yet to secure an agreement of the terms of its departure. In the event of a no-deal Brexit, the EU has agreed that investment firms in the bloc could continue using LCH in London to avoid disruption, but this temporary measure expires at the end of March 2020.
Without a extension, LCH may end serving notice on customers by the end of 2019 to shift positions.
""Switching existing business and conducting new business at Eurex Clearing now seems to be a no-regret move for many firms,"" said Matthias Graulich, a member of Eurex Clearing's executive board.
More than 80 clearing members and over 250 clients have been ""on-boarded"" for swaps clearing, Eurex said. Market share in euro-denominated outstanding volume has been continually growing, reaching 13% at present, it added."

The response comes after China Labor Watch on Monday issued a lengthy report accusing the two companies of breaching numerous Chinese labor laws, including one barring temporary staff from exceeding 10% of the total workforce.
U.S. tech firm Apple relies heavily on Taiwan's Foxconn and its Chinese manufacturing facilities to produce devices such as the iPhone, the next line of which will be unveiled on Tuesday.
In a statement, Apple said it investigated the percentage of temporary workers among the overall workforce and found it ""exceeded our standards"". It said it was working with Foxconn to ""immediately resolve the issue"".
Apple did not state whether the excess amounted to a breach of Chinese law. It declined to comment when asked directly by Reuters.
China's Ministry of Human Resources and Security did not respond to a Reuters fax seeking comment. Reuters could not immediately determine any penalty for temporary employees exceeding 10% of the workforce.
Apple also said it discovered interns at a supplier facility had worked overtime at night, violating company policy, and that ""this issue has been corrected."" It said the interns worked overtime voluntarily and were properly compensated.
Foxconn separately confirmed over-reliance on temporary workers, known internally as dispatch workers.
""We did find evidence that the use of dispatch workers and the number of hours of overtime work carried out by employees, which we have confirmed was always voluntary, was not consistent with company guidelines,"" Foxconn said.
It said it ""immediately began a detailed process to ensure that all issues were addressed"".
The labor report comes at a time of trade tension between the United States and China that has threatened to upend supply chains across the technology industry with tit-for-tat import tariffs.
Earlier this year, media reports said Apple was considering moving some operations out of China to avoid new U.S. tariffs, with Japan's Nikkei Asian Review in June putting the figure at 15% to 30% of production.
In an earnings call in July, Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook downplayed such speculation, stating the vast majority of Apple's products ""are kind of made everywhere.""
""There's a significant level of content from the United States and a lot from Japan to Korea to China, and the European Union also contributes a fair amount. And so, that's the nature of a global supply chain. Largely, I think that will carry the day in the future as well."""

LONDON (Reuters) - Global stock markets gained on Monday as investors pinned their hopes on stimulus that's expected from the world's central banks to support slowing growth.
European markets opened higher after data showed a surprise rise in German exports and on expectations of stimulus by the European Central Bank later this week. The pan-European STOXX 600 index (STOXX) was up 0.1% by 0747 GMT. 
MSCI's All Country World Index (MIWD00000PUS), which tracks shares across 47 countries, was up 0.05%.
Germany's trade-sensitive DAX index (GDAXI) rose 0.2% after data showed that seasonally adjusted exports rose 0.7% in July. A Reuters poll of economists had pointed to a drop of 0.5%.
The data were a positive surprise in largely gloomy readouts from major economies since Friday, which heightened expectations of stimulus from central banks.
On Friday, U.S. jobs growth slowed more than expected in August, while data over the weekend from China showed the country's exports unexpectedly shrank as shipments to the U.S. slowed.
The two countries have been locked in a trade dispute since early 2018, and investors fear escalating tariffs between them -- already curtailing growth -- might tip the global economy into recession as early as next year.

The Australian dollar , sensitive to shifts in risk appetite, remained near a five-week peak of $0.6862 set on Friday.
The pound was little changed at $1.2287 . Sterling has bounced from a three-year low set a week ago as the threat of Britain leaving the European Union without a deal on Oct. 31 seemed to diminish.
But political uncertainty remains, preventing the pound from gaining ground. British lawmakers will vote on Monday on whether to hold an early election.

(Reuters) - European stock markets hovered at one-month highs on Monday after data showed a surprise rise in German exports and on firmer expectations of a new wave of stimulus by the European Central Bank later this week.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index (STOXX) opened higher but was down 0.1% as losses in the airlines and commodities sectors outweighed gains in oil and auto stocks.
German exports rose 0.7% in July versus expectations of a drop of 0.5%, indicating resilience in the face of impact from tariff disputes and Brexit uncertainties.
The latest data follow a streak of underwhelming ones that has fueled concerns that Europe's biggest economy could tip into recession in the July-September quarter. 
""Germany is the powerhouse of Europe. If (its) economy has the potential for recession, then that's a real game changer for ECB policy,"" said Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at Oanda.
With euro zone inflation well below target, market participants are betting that the ECB will cut its rate on bank overnight deposits, its primary interest rate tool, for the first time since 2016 when it meets on Thursday.
A slew of upbeat geopolitical news propelled stock markets to one-month highs last week and signs of resumption in the U.S.-China trade talks further brightened sentiment. 
However, mixed economic data from around the world has increased hopes of more stimulus by central banks to head off a global recession. 
Markets were lifted on Friday after China said it would slash the amount of cash that banks must hold as reserves, while U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said the central bank would continue to ""act as appropriate"" to sustain economic expansion.
Air France (PA:AIRF) slid to the bottom of the index after disappointing August numbers, while IAG (L:ICAG) fell 2.5% as British Airways pilots began a 48-hour strike. Together, the stocks put the travel and leisure sector (SXTP) on track for its worst day in nearly a month. 
Commodity-lined stocks (SXPP) were the among biggest drag on the market, weighed down by a decline in base metal and iron ore prices. 

Germany's trade-sensitive DAX index (GDAXI) was trading flat. Broadcaster ProSiebenSat 1 Media (DE:PSMGn) topped the STOXX 600 after brokerage UBS upgraded the stock to ""buy"" from ""neutral"".

The firm has already launched its products in Hong Kong and Macau and now ships to 450 restaurants in Asia, but it wants to boost its presence in the Chinese mainland, where meat production is harder as a result of chronic land and water shortages, Pat O'Brown said.
He said the company was in preliminary talks with potential partners, and was hoping to find enterprises or local governments that would help bring their technology to China once the firm completes the required regulatory processes.
""China is our highest priority for future expansion, full stop,"" O'Brown told Reuters on the sidelines of the Fortune Sustainability Forum at Fuxian Lake in southwest China's Yunnan province.
""It is the biggest consumer of meat in the world,"" he said. ""Something like half the growth in meat consumption globally in the past 10 years or so has been in China. Effectively, the place where we can have the greatest impact on our mission is in China.""
Impossible Foods' main rival, Los Angeles-based Beyond Meat (O:BYND), has also yet to make a move into China. The foreign firms will also face competition from domestic companies such as Shenzhen-based Whole Perfect Foods.
O'Brown said Impossible Foods eventually aims to move some production into Asia, with the firm already looking at potential sites. He did not elaborate.
""We wish it was faster but we'll go through it, just as we have in the United States and other places,"" he said. ""I am completely confident that we will make it.""
""As soon as we have gone through the process and are welcomed into China by the government, and we have partners to work with, we're going to move as fast as we possibly can,"" he added.
While China's per capita meat consumption is much lower than the United States, demand has been increasing. It produces about 54 million tonnes of pork a year, about half the world's total.
China's beef production also rose to its highest level in at least 20 years last year at 6.44 million tonnes, and imports have surged. It also buys about 60% of globally traded soybeans to feed its pigs and other livestock.
The government has been trying to address environmental pressures caused by livestock farming, shutting down or relocating large numbers of poorly-managed pig and chicken farms. The state-run China Nutrition Society has even tried - with little success - to encourage the public to eat less meat and dairy."

Investing.com -- It’s a miserable, manic Monday for airline stocks across Europe thanks to a triple-whammy of bad news from France, Germany and the U.K.
The biggest loser in early trading was Air France-KLM (PA:AIRF), which fell as much as 8.4% after a report that it will step in to rescue the bankrupt Aigle Azur airline. EasyJet (LON:EZJ), which was also linked with making a bid for Aigle Azur, fell 3.2%.
The news threatens a rerun – albeit on a smaller scale – of the Air Berlin fiasco two years ago, when Europe’s airlines passed up a golden opportunity to resolve problems of overcapacity in the short-haul segment, and instead carved up the collapsed operator's assets between themselves in an attempt to grab market share.
As with the Air Berlin episode, there is the suspicion that the government will lean on the local national champion (then, Berlin and Lufthansa; now Paris and Air France-KLM) to come up with some of solution that minimizes job losses.
The timing of the report is unfortunate, in any case. Air France-KLM published disappointing traffic figures for August earlier, showing the economic slowdown taking a heavy toll on its business.
The number of the passengers carried by the Franco-Dutch group rose by only 1% from a year earlier. In the first seven months of the year, they’d been up 3.2%. Passenger growth is no longer keeping up with AF-KLM’s capacity growth: available seat-kilometers were up 1.6%. In other words, the group is flying more empty seats across the world – so, not the best time to be buying more uneconomic capacity, one might think.
Reminders of the sector’s recurring problems with overreaching were enough to push Ryanair (LON:RYA), Norwegian Air Shuttle (OL:NWC) and Wizz Air (LON:WIZZ) down by more than 2% each.
Germany’s Lufthansa was a relative outperformer, losing only 1.9%. That’s despite comments by the head of Germany’s Christian Democrats on Sunday that she supported a new tax on flights in order to reduce carbon emissions. Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer said in an interview with state broadcaster ARD that a levy on flights could be “one way” forward, along with cutting value-added tax on less carbon-intensive rail transport. France already introduced a carbon-related tax on flights earlier this summer, and a rapprochement of policy between the EU’s two biggest countries could pave the way for a pan-European initiative to limit emissions from one sector where they are still growing rapidly.
The third part of the triple-whammy Monday affected only one company: International Airlines Group (LON:ICAG) fell 1.8% as British Airways pilots began their biggest strike in over 40 years, in search of higher pay and better working conditions. That news had, however, been mostly priced in.
Elsewhere, Europe’s markets were mixed, with the benchmark STOXX 600 practically unchanged at 387.24. Italy's FTSE MIB led gains, up 0.3% to its highest level since late July. The U.K. FTSE 100 was down 0.1% along with the French CAC 40, while Germany’s DAX was up 0.2%. "

U.S. equity-index futures climbed, while Treasuries slipped with European bonds.
Automaker shares advanced and tourism companies declined in the Stoxx Europe 600 Index, while Japanese stocks led increases in Asia. S&P 500 futures ticked higher after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell gave his last speech before a Sept. 18 policy meeting and cemented views for another interest-rate reduction. Euro-area bonds fell as investors showed less conviction that the European Central Bank’s policy meeting Thursday will result in bold steps for more monetary stimulus. On Friday, the People’s Bank of China said it will cut the amount of cash banks must hold as reserves to the lowest level since 2007, injecting liquidity into the economy as the trade war with the U.S. weighs on growth.
Central banks returned to the spotlight as protectionist moves by the world’s two biggest economies cast shadows across the growth outlook elsewhere and more high-level Sino-U.S. talks are not expected until next month. Traders were kept somewhat on edge with data over the weekend showing China’s exports unexpectedly contracted in August, and last week’s U.S. employment report weaker than many forecast.
“There has been a tremendous rally in bonds and the central banks are the key determinant of what’s going to happen with the rates market,” Frances Hudson, global thematic strategist for multi-asset investing at Aberdeen Standard Investments, told Bloomberg TV. “With equities there is still an element of self-determination.”
Elsewhere, oil extended gains after Saudi Arabia ousted its energy minister before an OPEC+ committee that monitors compliance with output cuts meets this week in Abu Dhabi. The pound steadied as Boris Johnson held fast to his Brexit plan, despite the latest defection from his political party.

489,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 09, 2019 04:16AM ET</span>",Lloyds warns mis-selling could cost it an extra $2.2 billion,"By Carolyn Cohn and Iain Withers
LONDON (Reuters) - Lloyds Banking Group (L:LLOY) will set aside up to an extra 1.8 billion pounds ($2.2 billion) to settle mis-selling claims in Britain's costliest consumer banking scandal, and said it was suspending its 2019 share buyback program.
Banks are putting aside more money to pay claims against mis-sold payment protection insurance (PPI) following a rush of consumer enquiries about compensation ahead of the deadline on Aug. 29.
PPI policies were sold alongside a personal loan or mortgage to cover repayments if borrowers fell ill or lost jobs, but many were unsuitable. 
The PPI saga has already cost lenders more than 36 billion pounds in payouts, with analysts estimating the final bill could top 50 billion pounds.
RBS (L:RBS) said last week it faced additional costs of up to 900 million pounds, while Clydesdale Bank made a fresh 300-450 million pound provision.
As Britain's biggest domestic lender, Lloyds has been the most exposed to PPI and has already paid out more than 20 billion pounds.
Lloyds said on Monday it had received 600,0000-800,000 requests for information about PPI per week in August, well above its expectations of around 190,000 per week. 
As a result, it expects to set aside a further 1.2-1.8 billion pounds in its third quarter results to cover payouts. 
The bank's shares fell more than 2% in early trading.
Lloyds also said it had received a claim submitted by the Insolvency Service's Official Receiver on behalf of bankrupt consumers, pushing costs higher.
It added the charge would dent its profitability and scrapped guidance for a return on tangible equity of around 12% this year. It also warned the increase in its capital ratio in 2019 would be below its 170-200 basis points per annum guidance.
The lender made a PPI provision in its second quarter of 650 million pounds.
Lloyds had been expected to make a further provision following its rivals' moves, with analysts at KBW saying they had downgraded the bank last week partly due to the expected charge. KBW said the top end of the charge at 1.8 billion was marginally better than its worse case scenario.
Lloyds was given some breathing space on capital in May, when regulators reduced its required core capital ratio to 12.5% from 13%, equating to around 1 billion pounds.
Lloyds is continuing to target paying a dividend and said it would make a decision on surplus capital at the end of the year.

(The story corrects claim numbers to per week in paragraph seven.)

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia's Alrosa (MM:ALRS) is talking to several global jewelery retailers about jointly marketing the miner's jewelery brand that uses fluorescent diamonds, as it strives to create a new niche for the natural stones.
Diamond miners, which have long excelled at marketing, are seeking new approaches to battle falling demand and competition from diamonds manufactured in laboratories.
""We are completing talks with several major companies in different regions,"" Alrosa Chief Executive Sergei Ivanov told Reuters.
Alrosa, which now sells these diamonds mixed with others in ""lots"", expects the retailers to start offering its fluorescent stones in a year under the brand ""Luminous Diamonds"", which it has recently created, in separate corners of their stores.
The aim is to create a new market for stones with fluorescence, often a blueish glow visible under light, that are still considered by many traders as being of lower quality.
Global demand for all types of diamonds has been hit by a trade war between the United States and China, the world's two biggest diamond markets. Prices for smaller stones have fallen as deliberate output reductions have yet to remove oversupply. Alrosa and its competitors, chiefly Anglo American's (L:AAL) De Beers, are betting on a ""value over volume"" strategy. Alrosa expects to produce 38.5 million carats in 2019 but will sell only 32 million to 33 million carats, stockpiling the rest until better days.
Alrosa does not disclose the names of the retailers it is talking to but says it has no plans to start its own retail business. Product sales will be organized by retailers via their own distribution chains.
""Our aim is to supply fluorescent polished diamonds - cut by Alrosa or its clients - to retailers and provide marketing support, including jewelery design if needed,"" Ivanov said.
FLUORESCENT ADOLESCENT
Fluorescence, a bluish glow produced by ultraviolet rays from a lamp or the sun, is a characteristic of 25% to 35% of diamonds, according to the Gemological Institute of America (GIA). It is not bad for the precious stone, according to GIA, and it is not a grading factor like the traditional 4Cs -- color, clarity, cut and carat weight -- used to determine quality.
About half of all diamonds produced globally have some fluorescence, while 3% to 10% have strong fluorescence, Ivanov said.
But such diamonds are more difficult to sell as many traders now consider stones with more fluorescence as lower quality, so they often trade at a 25% to 45% discount, even though they could demand a premium several decades ago, he said.
With global annual rough diamond sales of $15 billion and diamond jewelery demand at $85 billion, any new marketing niche is attractive for the entire supply chain.
Diamond industry players have long been betting on ""millennial"", born between the early 1980s and early 2000s, and ""generation Z"", born from the mid-1990s to early 2000s, as drivers of growth in jewelery demand as their spending power rises.
Alrosa aims to woo this generation with florescent stones.
Recent research conducted by a consulting company for Alrosa in the United States and China showed millennial liked the stones for their unusual quality in jewelery, Ivanov said.
""We saw that it can become a fashionable product and interesting for these young people,"" he said.
The same research also showed positive results among women, so the ""Luminous Diamonds"" brand sought to appeal to women's independence and purchasing power, which was rising in the United States, China and India, the CEO added.
""It will be a special line. A diamond which glows in a night club, in a theater or even in the rays of sun,"" Ivanov said. ""We see this demand in opinion polls and are sure that we will convert it into sales."""

MARANELLO, Italy (Reuters) - Ferrari (M:RACE) will reveal its latest sports car on Monday as the Italian premium automaker pursues an aggressive roll-out of new models to sustain its turbo-charged core earnings and share price growth.
With a 720-horse power 3.9 liter eight-cylinder mid-rear mounted engine, the F8 Spider also has a retractable hard top.
""It is less extreme than the 488 Pista Spider, but sportier than the 488 Spider which it replaces in the range,"" Ferrari said in a statement.
Ferrari Chief Executive Louis Camilleri has promised to launch 15 new models between 2019 and 2022, and achieve a significant increase in average retail price.
The average sales price for a Ferrari stood at around 274,000 euros ($303,000) last year, including spare parts, a calculation based on financial data from the company shows.
The carmaker will unveil another model later on Monday at an event for clients and fans in its historic base in Maranello, near Modena, northern Italy.
One more launch is expected by the end of the year to take the total to five in 2019, including the F90 Stradale, Ferrari's first hybrid car to be widely produced.
Ferrari has also promised several special edition hybrid cars and a utility vehicle, the Purosangue, which is expected by late 2022 as it seeks to almost double core earnings and boost margins to above 38% without sacrificing exclusivity. 
GRAND TOURING
Chairman John Elkann hinted last month that the last release of 2019 could be a grand touring (GT) model. These are more understated but more comfortable on longer trips than Ferrari's high-performance sports cars.
Models from the 1960s, some with seating for four people, are among the most popular at auctions and enthusiast events and Ferrari has said previously that about 40% of its total sales could come from GT cars by 2022, up from 32% now.
Elkann, however, said that Ferrari - which shipped fewer than 10,000 cars last year - would not try to chase German rival Porsche which has expanded its sales volumes to more than 250,000 sports cars and SUVs annually.
The 'Cavallino Rampante', or 'Prancing Horse', known for its racing pedigree and roaring combustion engines, wants 60% of its cars sold by 2022 to be hybrids. Ferrari is also considering a full-electric model, but that will not hit the road before 2023. 
PRICING
After five new models in 2019, Ferrari is set to slow down the roll-out of new vehicles in the coming years.
Mediobanca analyst Andrea Balloni predicts more moderate growth in Ferrari car deliveries after a 10.2% increase in 2018 with a high single digit figure expected in 2019.
""We'll see more sustained growth in Ferrari average selling price,"" the Milan-based analyst said.
""The real challenge for Ferrari is how far it will be able to push price increases in the coming years"".
Ferrari does not change the selling price during a model's life-cycle, normally four to five years. Prices increase only through the introduction of new models, which, in Ferrari's philosophy, always mean better performance than previous ones.
""We are managing our waiting lists in a very judicious and very careful manner to ensure that we will retain our pricing power for the long term and that's very, very important,"" CEO Camilleri told an analyst call last month. 
Analysts at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) said last week that they saw Ferrari showing sustainable growth, especially in China.
""We believe Ferrari's strong pricing power should drive higher average sales prices and in turn support an increase in margins across its model launches,"" they said in a report, adding that it would continue to return capital to shareholders.

This might provide further support to Ferrari shares, which have more than tripled in value since they were listed in Milan in January 2016.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Consumer lender Home Credit is poised to offer the biggest test of Hong Kong's capital markets since China's  Alibaba  delayed plans for a $15 billion listing last month because of the political turmoil engulfing the city.
The Prague-based lender, which has a sizeable Chinese business, could launch its initial public offering as soon as this month, and is seeking to raise more than $1 billion from the offering in the first of a series of significant IPOs planned in the city.
Hong Kong's markets have been weakened by frequently violent pro-democracy protests and political turmoil over the past three months, slashing a 12% gain for the year to June on the blue-chip Hang Seng Index to a 3% positive performance by Monday. By contrast the benchmark U.S. S&P 500 (SPI) is up 18.8% so far this year.
Police fired tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse demonstrators in the Central business district and the upmarket Causeway Bay shopping district on Sunday, as the city endures its worst social unrest since its handover from British rule to China in 1997.
Last month, Alibaba (N:BABA) dealt the city's investment professionals a blow when it delayed plans for a $15 billion listing in Hong Kong, choosing to hold off until the city's politics and its markets had stabilized, Reuters reported.
That deal delay came soon after brewing giant AB InBev (BR:ABI) pulled the $10 billion IPO of its Asia-Pacific operations, citing market conditions.
Home Credit's forthcoming IPO will be a key gauge of sentiment as typically the last four months of the year are the busiest in Hong Kong for public floats, accounting for an average 51% of the funds raised annually over the past decade, according to Refinitiv data.
Shanghai Henlius Biotech, a developer of innovative drugs and biosimilars - which are not exact replicas but are as effective as the original drug - is also expected to launch an IPO of up to $500 million this week.
Hillhouse-backed Topsports International Holdings begins informal investor meetings this week according to a term sheet reviewed by Reuters, ahead of a float expected to seek about $1 billion.
VALUATION PUSHBACK
So far this year, companies have raised $10.8 billion in new listings in Hong Kong - well short of the $16.5 billion raised between Shanghai and Shenzhen, and the $38.4 billion raised in New York.
The political uncertainty is making investors cautious and will weigh on valuations, bankers have warned.
""In good markets, generally good issuers would have a bigger say in deal terms and valuations, but that's not the case any more as the Hong Kong market has turned volatile,"" said a banker involved in one of the deals poised to launch. ""The upcoming issuers have to be more realistic and moderate on valuations if they want to get the deal done.""
Home Credit's week-long informal investor meetings were scheduled to take in cities including Hong Kong, Singapore and London before finishing in New York on Wednesday, according to sources with knowledge of the plans.
The lender, which focuses on point-of-sale loans as well as cash loans and revolving loan products, has an extensive Chinese business that accounts for almost two thirds of its total loan portfolio.
""The business (of Home Credit) is definitely a good one and they have great market position. It's just whether the current market environment can deliver a deal that they think they deserve,"" said one source with knowledge of the deal.
As well as Home Credit, Shanghai Henlius Biotech and Topsports, Chinese lender Bank of Guizhou began meeting with potential investors last week for an IPO of up to $1 billion, while baby-formula maker China Feihe is due to seek approval on Thursday from Hong Kong's Listing Committee for a float of about the same amount, sources said.
""With all the uncertain, unpredictable factors in mind, investors would become way more cautious about issuers' target valuations,"" said a banker involved in one of the deals.
Home Credit, Henlius, Topsports, Bank of Guizhou and China Feihe declined to comment. All the people declined to be identified as they were not authorized to speak to the media."

TOKYO/PARIS (Reuters) - Nissan Motor Co's (T:7201) nominations committee will discuss potential successors for Hiroto Saikawa at a meeting on Monday, a source said, as pressure deepened on the embattled chief executive after he admitted to improper compensation.
While Saikawa has told some executives of his intention to step down, the timing of such a move would be discussed by the committee, said the person, who declined to be identified because the information is not public. Both the committee and Nissan's board were due to meet on Monday. 
Saikawa admitted last week to being improperly overpaid and violating internal procedures. That admission, which followed an internal investigation, has pitched Nissan into fresh crisis and appears to have accelerated the search for a replacement.
His successor will inherit a company that has been battered by the arrest and subsequent ouster of former chairman Carlos Ghosn last year. Ties with top shareholder  Renault  SA (PA:RENA) have been deeply strained, casting doubt on the future of the Franco-Japanese automaking alliance.
""The nominating committee will also meet today and discuss the selection of a successor and the timing of the resignation,"" the person said. ""Saikawa isn't at all clinging to his president's chair. He never has been,"" the person said. 
The committee, established in June to find a successor, is made up of six company outsiders, including Renault Chairman Jean-Dominique Senard. It has drawn up a list containing more than 10 possible candidates, an alliance source told Reuters.
Those on the list include Jun Seki, tasked with Nissan's performance recovery, Chief Competitive Officer Yasuhiro Yamauchi, and Makoto Uchida, chairman of Nissan's management committee in China, said the alliance source, who also spoke on condition of anonymity. 
Nissan declined to comment on Saikawa's intention to resign, and did not respond to a request for comment on Monday's meeting.
'PASS THE BATON'
The chief executive earlier told reporters that he wanted to ""pass the baton"" to the next generation as soon as possible, the Nikkei newspaper and other media outlets reported. He has previously made similar comments when asked about his future at the automaker.
Pressure has mounted on Saikawa given the company's poor performance and strained ties with Renault. Profit has tumbled to an 11-year low and prompted hefty job cuts.
The search and vetting process would likely take about six months as the committee considered both Japanese and non-Japanese candidates for the role, a third person with knowledge of the issue previously told Reuters.
Seki, who has been charged with leading the recovery, has been seen as a frontrunner for CEO. Prior to his latest promotion in June, the 58-year-old oversaw Nissan's expansion in China, now the automaker's top market. He joined the company in 1986. 
For investors, a key question will be how Saikawa's successor steers the alliance with Renault.
Yamauchi, the chief competitive officer, is widely seen as a bridge between the two firms and is also known to be well regarded at Renault. 

A near four-decade Nissan veteran, he rose up the ranks to be named head of global purchasing in 2009. In that role he was credited with efforts to bring the two automakers closer together for joint purchasing of more vehicle parts and materials, leveraging combined scale to lower costs.

498,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 09, 2019 01:56AM ET</span>","Samurai, Ninja loans boom as Japan banks hunt for yield","By Stanley White
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese regional banks are increasingly lending to foreign companies and other borrowers via samurai and ninja loans as they struggle with interest rates stuck at zero and seek to diversify their customer base.
Foreign companies who have long capitalized on the low cost of borrowing yen in the carry trade have also stepped up issuance of such credit as cross-currency interest rate swaps tumble.
""Regional banks have less opportunity to lend because the number of local companies is falling, and we have low margins because interest rates are so low,"" said Kazuyuki Ikegami, senior counselor in the Tokyo branch of Bank of Kyoto Ltd (T:8369), which is based in Western Japan.
""We need the opportunities to lend that samurai loans provide us, and they're great because they mitigate currency risk. We're putting more people on the samurai loan market.""
Samurai loans, which are yen loans issued in Japan by foreigners, doubled to $21.5 billion last year and have continued rising this year, according to Refinitiv data.
Ninja loans, debt issued by a foreigner in Japan in any currency that usually yields more than domestic yen lending, jumped 50% in the first half of the year - the fastest pace since the first half of 2015 - according to data from LPC, a fixed income news service that is part of Refinitiv.
(Graphic: Samurai and Ninja loan issuance - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/12/5754/5704/samurai%20and%20ninja%20loan%20issuance.png)
The trend shows Japan's yield-starved smaller regional banks are joining the mega-banks that previously dominated these markets, as they seek opportunities to put their vast deposits to work and generate higher returns.
Japanese banks can earn more in the samurai and ninja market for any given creditor profile than they can when they lend to domestic companies.
For example, Canada's largest pipeline operator  Enbridge  Inc (TO:ENB) issued a 3-year samurai loan paying 65 basis points over yen LIBOR earlier this year, according to Refinitiv. It has also sold a five-year tranche at 85 basis points over LIBOR.
Spreads on conventional loans to Japanese corporates rarely exceed 50 basis points above the benchmark rate. Japanese companies with the best credit ratings pay only a few basis points over the benchmark.
Non-Japanese companies typically in the financial services, utilities, and food and beverage sectors are exploiting the opportunity to raise near-zero loans and the opportunity to gain exposure to a broader range of investors.
CHEAP TO SWAP YEN
Foreign companies are opting to raise low-cost, long-term loans due to cheaper cross-currency interest rate swaps and the majority of borrowers come from the United States, India, Hong Kong and Canada, according to LPC data.
The cost to swap variable-rate yen loans into dollars has tumbled since the start of 2016, when the Bank of Japan adopted negative interest rates, making it more attractive for non-Japanese companies to borrow in yen.
(Graphic: Cross currency basis swap rates - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/12/5760/5710/cross%20currency%20basis%20swap%20rates.png)
The BOJ has been steadily pumping money into the financial system since it started quantitative easing in March 2014, by buying massive amounts of government debt to spur consumption in the world's third-largest economy.
Negative interest rates were meant to turbocharge already loose monetary conditions by pushing up lending and consumer prices, but the policies haven't helped the economy much.
Commercial banks bristled at the notion of having to pay 0.1% on a small portion of their reserves kept at the central bank.
The yield curve flattened so much that banks could not earn money from the spread between short-term and long-term rates. Eight months after the introduction of negative rates, the BOJ said it would allow the yield curve to steepen, but this has done little to improve banks' margins.
Even worse, Japanese banks' domestic lending growth peaked in July 2017 and has been sluggish since.
""We are into the samurai loan market, because it is all about our need to get extra yield,"" said Takeshi Endo, deputy general manager of the financial markets department at Bank of Yokohama. ""I think more regional banks like ours will be drawn to the samurai loan market."""

Volocopter, which says it is building the world's first manned, electric and vertical takeoff air taxis, said in a statement on Monday that the other investors in the new funding round include German luxury car maker  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn), which it had previously raised money from.
It did not say how much each investor contributed, but added that the most recent deal increases the total capital it has raised to 85 million euros, and that the new funds will be used toward bringing its VoloCity aircraft to commercial launch within the next three years.
Geely's chairman Li Shufu said in the statement that the investment reflected how the Chinese company is transitioning to become a mobility technology group, investing in and developing a wide range of next-generation technologies.
The co-operation underlines ""our confidence in Volocopter air taxis as the next ambitious step in our wider expansion in both electrification and new mobility services,” Li said.
The investment is not Geely's first bet on flying machines. It is building a plant in China's central city of Wuhan to make Terrafugia branded flying cars, company documents show.
Geely bought a 9.7% stake in Daimler in 2018. The companies have said they plan to build the next generation of Smart electric cars in China through a joint venture. They also plan to form a premium ride-hailing joint venture in China."
500,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 09, 2019 01:03AM ET</span>","Apple, Foxconn Broke a Chinese Labor Law to Build Latest iPhones","(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). and manufacturing partner Foxconn violated a Chinese labor rule by using too many temporary staff in the world’s largest iPhone factory, the companies confirmed following a report that also alleged harsh working conditions.
The claims came from China Labor Watch, which issued the report ahead of an Apple event on Tuesday to announce new iPhones. The non-profit advocacy group investigates conditions in Chinese factories, and says it has uncovered other alleged labor rights violations by Apple partners in the past.
For its latest report, CLW said undercover investigators worked in Foxconn’s Zhengzhou plant in China, including one who was employed there for four years. One of the main findings: Temporary staff, known as dispatch workers, made up about 50% the workforce in August. Chinese labor law stipulates a maximum of 10%, CLW noted.
Apple said that, after conducting an investigation, it found the “percentage of dispatch workers exceeded our standards” and that it is “working closely with Foxconn to resolve this issue.” It added that when it finds issues, it works with suppliers to “take immediate corrective action.” Foxconn Technology Group also confirmed the dispatch worker violation following an operational review.
Apple’s supply chain has faced criticism over poor labor standards for years, and the company has pushed manufacturing partners to improve factory conditions or risk losing business. However, suppliers and assemblers are always trying to churn out more handsets. Foxconn, officially known as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., hires tens of thousands of temporary workers to ramp up production and meet iPhone demand during the key holiday season each year.
“Our recent findings on working conditions at Zhengzhou Foxconn highlights several issues which are in violation of Apple’s own code of conduct,” CLW wrote in its report. “Apple has the responsibility and capacity to make fundamental improvements to the working conditions along its supply chain, however, Apple is now transferring costs from the trade war through their suppliers to workers and profiting from the exploitation of Chinese workers.”
CLW was founded in 2000 as a 501(c)(3) organization to investigate Chinese factories that make toys, shoes, electronics and other products for some of the world’s largest multinational companies. It has an office in New York City and one in Shenzhen that offers a hotline for factory workers in China, according to its website.
While its report said 55% of factory staff were dispatch workers in 2018, and about 50% in August, this included student interns. Because many of these students returned to school at the end of August, that number is now closer to 30%, which is still a violation, according to CLW.
“We believe everyone in our supply chain should be treated with dignity and respect,” Apple also said in a statement. “To make sure our high standards are being adhered to, we have robust management systems in place beginning with training on workplace rights, on-site worker interviews, anonymous grievance channels and ongoing audits.”
Foxconn said it found “evidence that the use of dispatch workers and the number of hours of overtime work carried out by employees, which we have confirmed was always voluntary, was not consistent with company guidelines.”
It added that its “work to address the issues identified in our Zhengzhou facility continues and we will closely monitor the situation. We will not hesitate to take any additional steps that might be required to meet the high standards we set for our operations.”
Apple releases an annual supplier responsibility report that details working conditions in its supply chain. In its latest report, Apple said it conducted 44,000 interviews with supplier employees last year to check if they were properly trained and knew how to voice concerns, while taking new steps to prevent forced labor.
In late 2017, Apple found Foxconn had employed high school students who worked illegal overtime to assemble the iPhone X. Apple sent specialists to the facility to work with management on systems that ensured appropriate standards were followed.
Foxconn is the largest of a coterie of gadget assemblers that produce most of the world’s consumer electronics from sprawling Chinese bases. Typically operating on wafer-thin margins, they employ millions of mostly migrant and temporary workers because activity tends to wax and wane with shopping seasons and fluctuations in demand.
Dispatch workers don’t receive benefits that full-time employees get, such as paid sick leave, paid vacations and social insurance, which provides medical, unemployment and pension coverage, according to CLW. While base wages can be higher for dispatch workers, they are paid by third-party firms on a short-term basis and are not employed directly by Foxconn, CLW says. Dispatch workers can become official factory workers after an initial three-month period, according to the group’s report.
Last month, Foxconn said it fired two executives at one of its Chinese plants after another CLW investigation found the company was relying heavily on temporary workers and teenage interns to assemble Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN). Echo speakers. Foxconn reviewed the Hengyang facility and found the proportion of contract workers and student interns had on occasion exceeded legal thresholds, and that some interns had been allowed to work overtime or nights.
The group, which also monitors conditions in myriad industries from apparel to retail, has run reports in the past on suppliers to the likes of  Nike  Inc (NYSE:NKE). and Adidas AG (DE:ADSGN) and, recently, probed a factory that manufactured Ivanka Trump-branded shoes.
Apple and Foxconn seek to produce about 12,000 iPhones per shift at the Zhengzhou factory, CLW’s latest report found. Last year’s iPhone XS models were more complex to build than the iPhone X, requiring more workers, the group also said.
According to emails seen by Bloomberg, Apple told CLW in August that it was looking into the findings and had questions about the report. The company sent an investigator to the factory and met with Foxconn officials to discuss the heavy use of dispatch workers, but Apple and Foxconn are still allowing the activity despite violating the 10% standard, CLW said.
The CLW report also detailed other findings, such as:
During peak production periods, resignations are not approved.Some dispatch workers have not received promised bonuses.Student workers do overtime during peak production season, even though regulations on student internships prohibit this.Some workers put in at least 100 overtime hours each month, during busy production periods. Chinese labor law limits monthly overtime to 36 hours.Workers must get approval to not do overtime. If requests are denied and staff still choose not to work overtime, they are admonished by managers and miss out on future overtime opportunities.Workers sometimes have to stay at the factory for unpaid meetings at night.The factory doesn’t provide adequate protective equipment for staff.Work injuries are not reported by the factory, and verbal abuse is common there.While overtime is allegedly often required, most workers want to work overtime to make more money, according to an anonymous diary written by a CLW investigator in the factory.
“We looked into the claims by China Labor Watch and most of the allegations are false,” Apple said. “We have confirmed all workers are being compensated appropriately, including any overtime wages and bonuses, all overtime work was voluntary and there was no evidence of forced labor.”
Apple added that less than 1% of workers were student workers, and that a small percentage of them voluntarily worked overtime or night shifts. Apple and Foxconn both said this issue has been corrected.
Most factory workers are paid about 4,000 yuan ($562) a month, one CLW investigator found. After taxes and mandatory fees, they get roughly 3,000 yuan a month, according to the CLW report.
China’s per capita disposable income was 28,228 yuan in 2018, or 2,352 yuan a month, China Daily reported earlier this year, citing government data.

The Shanghai Composite Index has rallied more than 20% this year, compared with a 3% advance by the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index in Hong Kong. The Shanghai measure is trading near its highest level relative to the H-share gauge since late 2017.
The bullish sentiment onshore comes amid expectations of state support ahead of the 70th anniversary of the People’s Republic of China on Oct. 1 -- even as foreign traders grow pessimistic in the face of a slowing global economy and a sliding yuan. After markets closed on Friday, the central bank lowered the amount of cash banks must hold as reserves to the lowest level since 2007.
""The divergence shows that domestic investors have more faith in China’s ability to guide its economy through the trade war,"" said Gu Yongtao, a Beijing-based strategist with Cinda Securities Co.
The Hong Kong market is more sensitive to flows of foreign funds, which will pull out of emerging markets amid global uncertainty, Gu said. Such sensitivities haven’t deterred bullish onshore investors from snapping up shares in Hong Kong’s stock market for 36 straight days as of Friday, the longest stretch since late 2017.
The latest easing may help sustain gains. The required reserve ratio for all banks will be lowered by 0.5 percentage points, taking effect on Sept. 16, the People’s Bank of China said Friday. The PBOC also cut the reserve ratios by one additional percentage point for some city commercial banks, to take effect in two steps on Oct. 15 and Nov. 15.
China Cuts Banks’ Reserve Ratio to Ramp Up Easing Support
The Shanghai Composite added 0.4% as of 10 a.m. local time while the Hang Seng China gauge was little changed.
""China has a strong central government, which has more policy room and influence over its markets and the economy than its peers, so local investors can count on that,"" said Dai Ming, a fund manager with Hengsheng Asset Management Co. Expectations that authorities will act to keep the mainland stock market stable before China’s national day celebrations will also boost onshore equities, he said.
The divergence between mainland stocks and their Hong Kong-listed peers will continue as long as the trade war drags on, according to Ronald Wan, chief executive of Partners Capital International Ltd. Offshore shares are also being hurt by weak sentiment in Hong Kong, he said. The city has been rocked by weeks of anti-Beijing protests that show no signs of abating and threaten to spur capital outflows.
Depreciating Yuan
The onshore gains defy a depreciating yuan that has weakened 3.5% this year. It fell past the key 7 per dollar level amid an escalation in the trade war.
The dropping yuan affects offshore equities more as Hong Kong-listed Chinese firms generate their earnings in yuan, so the weaker currency makes their valuations more expensive, according to Fu Gang, a fund manager with Shanghai RiverEast Asset Management Advisory Ltd.
China Stocks Turn Hot, Lure Most Foreign Inflows Since November
It’s not all gloom for H shares.
While the disconnect with mainland equities may remain in the near term, Fu expects the gap to narrow as valuations in Hong Kong have dropped to historical lows. China’s A shares are now nearly 30% more expensive than their Hong Kong-listed peers.
""H shares look very attractive from a valuation perspective,"" Fu said. ""As long as we have enough flows from the mainland, the valuation gap will shrink and H shares will likely flip."""
502,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 09, 2019 12:20AM ET</span>",Britain at risk of losing leading edge in maritime services,"By Jonathan Saul
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's position as a top hub for maritime services is being eroded by competition, a loss of shipping finance business and the removal of tycoon-friendly tax breaks, a report said, deepening uncertainty for its financial sector as Brexit nears.
The UK has been a pivotal global shipping center for centuries, especially the City of London, and has dominated marine insurance, ship broking, shipping finance and other maritime services. 
These contribute $5.6 billion a year to Britain’s economy, providing employment for more than 10,000 people in highly skilled jobs, according to a report by consultancy PwC, commissioned by trade association Maritime London.
But a shift in global shipping trade to Asia and tougher competition are adding to pressures on this niche sector, the report said. 
""We estimate that if the UK had maintained its market share over the last two years, this would have resulted in an additional $700 million p.a. (annually) in GVA (gross value added) for the UK economy,"" said the report, published in partnership with the City of London Corporation.
The global maritime services market is estimated to be worth $20 billion annually. 
""Significant ground has been lost to international competitors in recent years. Competitors such as the U.S., China, Norway and particularly Singapore, are all challenging in key areas of development and we must react,"" said Harry Theochari, chair of the separate Maritime UK body. 
The report, launched at the start of London International Shipping Week, comes as Britain spins toward an election. Brexit remains up in the air, more than three years after Britons voted to leave the European Union. Options range from a turbulent ""no-deal"" exit to abandoning the whole endeavor. 
The report's authors said their interviews with maritime services professionals ""offered mixed views on the impact of Brexit on the UK’s perception as a politically stable country"". 
""Some pointed to opportunities to reduce regulation post-Brexit, while others expressed concerns about the availability of talent and the perception of the UK as ‘open for business’,” the report said.
The exodus from shipping finance by many leading lenders including Britain's Royal Bank of Scotland (L:RBS) and Lloyds (L:LLOY) had affected London's position as a money destination for international shipping firms, the report said.
Separately, Britain's decision to scrap tax breaks for long-term residents who claim ""non-domicile"" status led to the departure of prominent Greek players from London in recent years.
""The UK needs to be more active in courting ship owners and other industry participants to come here,"" the report said.
""It is also vital that post-Brexit, the UK remains open and welcoming to foreign talent.""
The report said the UK maintained 25% of the maritime services market. It recommended more efforts to bring dual listings to the London Stock Exchange to boost capital markets activity for shipping as well as taking a lead in developing environmental finance products, while providing tax incentives. 

""What’s critical is that we work to strengthen the core of ship owners and charterers in the UK, which will provide a significant boost to the UK economy,"" Maritime UK's Theochari said.

""Based on what I know, I wouldn't think that is anywhere on the agenda, no way,"" Air China non-executive director Stanley Hui told the newspaper when asked if the carrier, a 30% shareholder, might seek to buy Cathay outright.
The Hong Kong airline has become the biggest corporate casualty of anti-government protests after China demanded it suspend staff involved in, or who support, demonstrations that have plunged the former British colony into a political crisis.
Cathay Chairman John Slosar last week announced plans to step down in November, less than three weeks after CEO Rupert Hogg left amid mounting regulatory scrutiny.
Air China is Cathay's second-largest shareholder, behind manager Swire Pacific Ltd (HK:0019) with a 45% stake. Long-time Swire executive Patrick Healy was last week appointed as Slosar's replacement.
Some analysts have said it would be logical for Air China to take over the remainder of Cathay in the future.
However, Hui told the South China Morning Post that any Beijing-led moves that changed Cathay Pacific's ownership would send a wrong signal to foreign investors.
Air China could not be reached immediately for comment."
504,By Investing.com,"<span>Sep 08, 2019 10:22PM ET</span>",Asia stocks set to climb on expectation of China liquidity measures,"
Investing.com – Stocks were set to trend upwards on Monday morning in Asia, driven by expectations that China will boost liquidity in the market to overcome a slowdown in exports. 
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index gave up early increases to head mildly into the red in early trading. The index was down 0.12% to 26,569 by 10:07 PM ET (02:07 GMT). Hong Kong has been trending higher since Chief Executive Carrie Lam agreed on Sept. 4 to fully withdraw a controversial extradition bill that has led to 14 weeks of often violent protests. On Monday morning, investors seemed to shrug off yet another weekend of protests and outburst of confrontations between protesters and police.  
Lam’s move coincided with some positive news on trade negotiations between the U.S. and China, with both sides agreeing to get back to the negotiating table in early October.  
Mainland China stocks have also been trending higher on news that trade negotiations are likely to kick off again. China’s Shanghai Composite was up 0.46% early in the morning session Monday to 3,013. The Shenzhen Component was up 0.46% at 9,871.  
Chinese stocks rose despite new data showing that exports fell in August by 1% year-on-year, according to customs data. Analysts who responded to a Reuters poll had predicted a 2% increase. The ongoing trade war with the U.S. seems to be having an impact on both Chinese shipments and global trade.  
The silver lining for investors is that the data adds to the possibility of Beijing introducing stimulus measures. On Friday, the People’s Bank of China cut the reserve requirement ratio (RRR) for banks by 50 basis points and 100 basis points for some banks. This is the amount banks are expected to hold on reserve. Cutting it frees up liquidity that banks can deeply.  
“In our view, more significant steps are needed if policymakers want to stabilize growth next year at around 5.7%, which we think they do,” said Louis Kuijs, head of Asia economics at Oxford Economics, in comments to CNBC. “In this setting, we expect more visible improvements in imports further down the road.” 
Meanwhile, South Korea’s KOSPI was up 0.72% to 2,023. The Korea benchmark was up despite the beginning of the first-ever autoworkers strike in the country, with unionized workers at General Motors Co. launching a three-day strike seeking better pay and conditions.  
Data out on Sunday from the Korea Economic Research Institute (KERI) suggested the economy could expand by 1.9% this year, 0.3% lower than the 2.2% suggested in June. KERI attributed the slowdown to the ongoing trade dispute between China and the U.S. 
Japan’s Nikkei 225 was up 0.44% to 21,293 while Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 was virtually flat, up just 0.07% to 6,652. 
On Friday, U.S. markets lost some steam after a nonfarm payrolls report that did not meet expectations with an increase of just 130,000 in August.

The British Airline Pilots Association (BALPA) last month gave the airline notice of three days of industrial action in September, in what is the first ever strike by BA pilots. 
Following the strikes on Sept. 9 and 10, another day of industrial action is scheduled for Sept. 27. 
BALPA has said that British Airways (BA) should share more of its profits with its pilots. BA has said the strike action is unjustifiable as its pay offer was fair.
Thousands of customers have had to seek alternative travel arrangements, and the airline has come in for criticism over how it handled communications with passengers ahead of the strikes.
""This strike will have cost the company considerably more than the investment needed to settle this dispute,"" BALPA General Secretary Brian Strutton said in a statement on the eve of the strike.
""It is time to get back to the negotiating table and put together a serious offer that will end this dispute.""
Last Thursday, the airline dismissed a new offer by BALPA as an ""eleventh hour inflated proposal"" that was not made in good faith. BALPA had said it would have called off the strikes this week if BA had engaged with the offer.
A spokeswoman for Prime Minister Boris Johnson has urged both sides to end the dispute.
Asked about the strike action, a spokeswoman for British Airways said: ""We remain ready and willing to return to talks with BALPA.""
The UK Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) is investigating the airline after it enraged some travelers by wrongly telling them their flights had been canceled.

The regulator also reminded the airline to proactively tell customers of their rights. During the strikes, BA must offer the passengers reimbursement for canceled flights, alternate travel arrangements under comparable conditions or a new flight at a later date.

CNBC reported earlier on Sunday that  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS) had competed with JPMorgan, but its chances were hurt by its work leading the IPO of Uber (N:UBER) as Saudi officials were not pleased with Morgan Stanley bankers misjudging demand. 

Aramco and JPMorgan declined to comment.

Board member Torsten Jeworrek, speaking at an industry conference, said that the estimate was a ""rough guess"" as damage was still to be tallied.
Dorian ripped into the Bahamas earlier this week, leaving a trail of destruction and death, before pounding parts of North Carolina and moving on to Canada.
Separately, Jeworrek said he expected reinsurance rates to rise further across the industry, stabilizing after years of declines.
The ""clear expectation"" is a ""further stabilization and price increases,"" Jeworrek said.

LONDON (Reuters) - A British demand for supermarkets to prepare for a potentially chaotic no-deal Brexit by stockpiling food is stoking anger in the industry, with bosses saying they should not be blamed if people can't find everything they want on the shelves.
With British politics spiraling toward an unpredictable endgame, makers of food and drugs are having to restructure operations in case the arrival of customs checks shatters supply chains, clogs ports and delays deliveries.
The food industry has warned that their stockpiling can only go so far, and executives have expressed incredulity at Michael Gove, the minister in charge of no-deal Brexit planning, who vowed this month that there would be no shortages of fresh food if Britain leaves the European Union (EU) without agreement on Oct. 31.
Already burned twice by the government delaying supposedly steadfast dates for Britain's exit from the EU, the industry is also wary of spending hundreds of millions of pounds again when the outcome is so uncertain.
""There is a clear attempt (by government) to talk to a narrative which is that companies, if only they prepared properly, would be able to cope and it's companies fault if they haven't,"" said Justin King, who was CEO of Sainsbury's (L:SBRY), Britain's second largest supermarket chain, for 10 years.
""As night follows day, if 50% of lorries are delayed there will be gaps on the shelves inside seven days,"" King, currently a director at retailer Marks & Spencer (L:MKS), told Reuters.
A senior executive at one of Britain's big four supermarkets, which includes  Tesco  (L:TSCO), Morrisons (L:MRW) and Asda (N:WMT), said the government was increasingly treating the industry as an extended arm of the state.
""The fundamental question is, whose job is it to provide food for the UK in the case of a blockade?"" he said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
""Taking measures to reasonably protect our business from the impact of Brexit is our duty. When you start to say 'what is your business doing to feed the nation' – that starts to move us out of reasonable steps.""
In an emailed statement, the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said the UK had robust supply chains across a range of countries and was meeting regularly with industry and retailers to make sure they were fully prepared for Brexit.
""We have a highly-resilient food supply chain and consumers in the UK have access to a range of sources of food. This will continue to be the case when we leave the EU on 31 October, whatever the circumstances,"" the statement said.
Gove told parliament on Thursday that delays at the main port of Dover were a material risk but all would run smoothly if companies have the necessary customs declarations. While scarcity of some product lines may push up prices, it was unlikely to lead to full-scale shortages, he said.
""There is no good time of year to leave the European Union without a deal,"" he said. ""However we have to be ready for the consequences.""
MINCE PIES AND TOMATOES
Once considered the industry's nightmare scenario at the extreme edge of probability, a no-deal Brexit is now looking ever more possible after Prime Minister Boris Johnson vowed to take Britain out of the EU without an agreement if necessary.
While opposition parties are trying to force another delay, a looming election means nothing can be taken for granted.
That marks a major challenge for a food industry which relies heavily on imports from Europe during the autumn when warmer climes are needed to grow some fruit and vegetables. While Britain normally buys in around half of its food, with about a third coming from the EU, by the end of October the bloc provides some 86% of lettuces, 70% of tomatoes and 27% of soft fruit, according to the British Retail Consortium (BRC).
Food grown in North Africa also comes through Spain.
""I don't believe there is any risk that the UK will go hungry, the question is will the UK be able to eat what it wants to eat in terms of fresh food?,"" said the senior supermarket executive.
Autumn is also when retailers fill their warehouses ahead of the year's busiest shopping season -- Christmas.
Tesco boss Dave Lewis has said Britain's biggest retailer stockpiled over 200 million pounds worth of long-life goods by the original Brexit deadline of end March, but will struggle to repeat that due to the millions of mince pies, hams and cheeses that already sit in warehouses. [nL8N23K4UE]
Fresh food can't be stockpiled and border delays of a few days would wilt such produce meaning it could be put on final discount almost as soon as it arrives in store.
Tesco, with a No. 1 grocery market share of 27%, a workforce of 320,000 and a sourcing base of over 50 countries, expects to hold its own alongside rivals.
Sainsbury's sources a higher proportion of cucumbers, tomatoes and peppers in Britain than others, Morrisons makes half of all its own brand and fresh food and Asda benefits from being part of Walmart, the world's biggest retailer.
The major supermarkets have declined to say how much they are spending on their Brexit preparations, and declined to give any more details about their current readiness for a no-deal departure.
UNDER PRESSURE
Ahead of the deadline, manufacturers, suppliers and retailers are battling to unravel a system honed over decades that delivers fresh and non-perishable goods to the stores just in time for sale, and in the most economically efficient way.
The need to build up stocks - to mitigate for any delays at ports - is putting pressure on the vast warehouses that form the backbone of Britain's food network. Jonathan Baker, executive director at Lineage UK, the world's largest temperature-controlled logistics firm, said his sites are at maximum capacity.
Working in the industry for 37 years, he said the whole system started to creak before the original March deadline, with some food deliveries failing as logistics providers struggled to extract goods on time from warehouses filled to the brim. ""It could be a lot worse in October,"" he said. ""The last Brexit deadline, we were coming out of a relatively quiet period whereas this is slap bang in the busiest time of year.""
With so much uncertainty in the air, supermarkets are asking suppliers to hold more stock, and are likely to source more longer-life vegetables such as carrots and potatoes to avoid any empty shelves, according to the BRC.
""If your competitor is doing better than you then the consumer will walk,"" said Andrew Opie, a director at the BRC lobby group. ""One of the key items that all consumers look for is tomatoes. If you can't see it you think the whole store is somehow depleted."""

""During final load testing on the 777X static test airplane, the team encountered an issue that required suspension of the test,"" Boeing spokesman Paul Bergman said in a statement. 
The Seattle Times reported a cargo door exploded outward during a high-pressure stress test on the ground. The newspaper said the accident occurred on a static test airplane, which is built for ground testing only and not intended to fly.
""Overall testing is continuing,"" Bergman said. The test occurred on Thursday, he said, declining to provide other details of the incident. 
The problem happened during the final test that must be passed as part of the plane's certification by the Federal Aviation Administration, the newspaper report said. 
In final load testing, planes are subjected to loads and stresses that are well beyond normal operational conditions, the spokesman said, adding that the incident is under review.
The company previously reported a delay on its 777X widebody program as  General Electric  Co (N:GE) engine problems pushed the first flight into 2020. 
Chicago-based Boeing has also been unable to deliver any of its 737 MAX aircraft since the single-aisle plane was grounded worldwide in March after two fatal crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia killed 346 people.

517,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 06, 2019 09:50PM ET</span>",Exclusive: WeWork to press on with IPO launch despite valuation concerns - sources,"By Anirban Sen and Joshua Franklin
(Reuters) - WeWork owner The We Company plans to proceed with an investor roadshow for its initial public offering (IPO) as early as next week, braving concerns over the valuation it can achieve in a listing, people familiar with the matter said on Friday. 
The company's IPO has been in doubt since Thursday, after sources said the U.S. office sharing startup now estimated it could be valued at a little over $20 billion in a listing, less than half the $47 billion valuation it achieved in a private fundraising round in January. 
Growing investor skepticism over We Company's lack of a roadmap to profitability, and its co-founder Adam Neumann's firm grip on its governance, are weighing on its IPO prospects.
A big drop in We Company's valuation would be a blow to its existing investors, including its biggest backer, Japan's SoftBank Group Corp. 
We Company told its IPO underwriters and potential stock market investors on Friday to expect the launch of the roadshow as early as the middle of next week, the sources said.
The sources cautioned that no final decision on beginning the roadshow has been taken and the plans are still subject to change. We Company declined to comment. 
An IPO roadshow is typically a 10-day period when companies solicit feedback from investors with the aim of convincing them to buy shares in the IPO. We Company would be hoping to convince investors to give it a valuation closer to what its venture capital backers placed on it.
We Company rents out workspace to clients under short-term contracts and pays rent for the properties under long-term leases.
The New York-based company lost more than $900 million in the first half of 2019, up 25% from a year earlier, even though its revenue doubled to $1.54 billion, as it burned through cash to expand.
The mounting losses and concerns over how its business model would survive an economic downturn have raised skepticism from analysts and investors about the IPO.
In August, We Company secured bank commitments for a $6 billion credit facility contingent on it raising billions of dollars in an IPO.
Complicating matters further, the company is looking to go public against a turbulent market backdrop, with the U.S.-China trade war making for the worst August for U.S. stocks in four years.
If We Company proceeds with its IPO, its private investors may take a loss on any shares sold, but they can make that up in the future if the company is able to achieve its projected valuation, said Adam Troso, head of real estate corporate advisory at Greenhill & Co, a New York investment bank.

""There's still an opportunity (for the value) to go back up to where you expect it to be. That's how an underwriter would explain it to his clients,"" Troso said.

518,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 06, 2019 09:47PM ET</span>",U.S. launches antitrust probe into California automaker agreement,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department is investigating whether the decision of four automakers in July to reach a voluntary agreement with California to adopt state emissions standards violated antitrust law, people briefed on the matter said on Friday.
The antitrust division's chief, Makan Delrahim, sent Aug. 28 letters to the four automakers saying the government was concerned the agreement ""may violate federal antitrust laws"" but adding it had ""reached no conclusions,"" according to documents seen by Reuters.
The disclosure comes as the Trump administration has ramped up its opposition to automakers seeking to sidestep it on rolling back Obama era fuel-efficiency rules. It also presages the beginning of a lengthy legal battle that will determine the future of U.S. vehicle emissions and California's role in setting vehicle rules.
In July, Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co, BMW AG, Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p) and Honda Motor Co said they had reached a deal to adopt standards that were lower than Obama era rules but higher than the Trump administration's 2018 proposal.
The automakers were defying the Trump administration's effort to strip California of the right to fight climate change by setting its own standards. Automakers fear years of legal battles and want to ensure certainty over the requirements they will face nationwide and think the deal will benefit them financially because it aims to avoid a patchwork of state requirements.
The Justice Department declined to comment on Friday. Delrahim's letters asked the four automakers to meet with the division ""and provide us with more information regarding the formation"" of the California deal and automakers' communications with each other.
U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a California Democrat, said the Justice Department must ""end this sham investigation and return to policing actual anticompetitive conduct."" The antitrust probe ""seeks to weaponize law enforcement for partisan political purposes to advance the Trump Administration’s toxic special interest agenda.""
Russ Vought, the acting director of the U.S. Office of Management and Budget, said in a statement on Friday that ""a handful of irresponsible auto makers are aiding California's radical agenda that will hurt every one of us."" He added: ""California is trying to impose its failed policies on the rest of the country.""
Vought's office is expected to approve final rules in the coming weeks to dramatically roll back the Obama era standards and revoke California's ability to set vehicle emissions rules.
California Governor Gavin Newsom blasted the Justice Department's antitrust probe. “The Trump Administration has been attempting and failing to bully car companies for months now,"" he said in a statement. ""We remain undeterred.""
California and the Trump administration have sparred on a number of fronts including over high-speed rail funding, power plant emissions and declaring a national emergency to use military funds to build a border wall.
Honda, Ford and BMW all confirmed they received a letter from the Justice Department. The probe is in its early stages, the people said.
""We look forward to responding to the Department of Justice to explain the planned (California Air Resources Board )framework agreement and its benefits to consumers and the environment,"" BMW said.
Separately on Friday, general counsels at the Environmental Protection Agency told California Air Resource Board Chair Mary Nichols in a letter that its actions in connection with the voluntary agreement ""appear to be unlawful and invalid.""
The letter, copies of which were also sent to the automakers' chief executives, warned that commitments made by the automakers ""may result in legal consequences given the limits placed in federal law on California's authority.""
Nichols did not immediately respond to a request for comment. California Attorney General Xavier Becerra said the state ""will continue its advance toward a cleaner future. We're prepared to defend the standards that make that promise a reality.""
Public Citizen, an advocacy group, called the investigation ""blatantly retaliatory"" and suggested the Trump administration is ""hell-bent on repealing the clean car standards.""
Trump has repeatedly attacked automakers for working with California and the White House has prodded other automakers not to sign up.
Volkswagen said in a statement it is in regular contact with U.S. authorities on several matters, but does not comment on specific private communications.
On Thursday, Reuters reported the administration was moving forward with plans to strip California of its waiver under the Clean Air Act to set its own vehicle emissions rules and requiring automakers to build an increasing number of zero-emission vehicles. White House adviser Larry Kudlow said Friday a final regulation could be issued in the coming weeks.
The Obama era rules called for a fleetwide fuel efficiency average of 46.7 miles (75.2 km) per gallon (mpg) by 2026, compared with 37 mpg (60 kpg) under the Trump administration's preferred option. The final regulation will modestly boost fuel efficiency over the preferred option's freeze of 2020 requirements but be far less than the Obama rules, Reuters reported on Thursday.
The Trump plan's preferred alternative would hike U.S. oil consumption by about 500,000 barrels per day in the 2030s while reducing automakers' collective regulatory costs by more than $300 billion."
519,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 06, 2019 06:04PM ET</span>","A Year After Armageddon, Stock Traders Stare Into a Familiar Abyss","(Bloomberg) -- Nobody knew it then, but this time last year, the rallying U.S. stock market was about to begin a plunge that would erase $5 trillion from share values and convince a lot of people a recession was at hand.
Then, as now, a trade war was raging, earnings in doubt and manufacturing losing steam. In the stock market, swings were getting violent -- even as the S&P 500 was pulling itself over 2,900 and flirting with an all-time high. Fast-forward to today, and the picture bears an eerie similarity.
Two things stand out in the comparison. One, a recession never came. Forecasting the economy is hard, something the market gets wrong as often as humans. Two, shock waves from last year’s plunge are still being felt, cementing Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell in his role as the main lifeline for risk assets.
“He’s on a tight rope like no other central banker has been before,” Chad Morganlander, a fund manager at Washington Crossing Advisors. “His message and his signal has been one to take a more balanced approach in the central bank’s behavior. Yes, the probability of a recession has increased, but it’s not flashing a warning light.”
It’s a message investors seem willing to accept, at least for now, and at least for as long as Trump limits his tweet tirades, amid the best two weeks of the quarter in the S&P 500. Credit the Powell Put or the fool-me-once effect, but they’re acting a little less panicked while staring into a familiar abyss. Markets gyrate, but so far every dip has been met with buyers.
Speaking in Zurich Friday, Powell said the most likely outlook for the U.S. and world economy is continued moderate growth, but the central bank was monitoring significant risks.
“We’re going to continue to watch all of these factors, and all the geopolitical things that are happening, and we’re going to continue to act as appropriate to sustain this expansion,” the chairman said. “Our main expectation is not at all that there will be a recession.”
A variety of things feed the case for a downturn, with most of the attention focused on the U.S.-China trade dispute, contractions in global manufacturing and the signal from bond markets.
On Tuesday, a key U.S. factory gauge, the Institute for Supply Management’s purchasing manager’s index, unexpectedly contracted for the first time since 2016. In the Treasury market, yields sit at half their level of a year ago and short-term rates have intermittently risen above longer ones, an inversion with a good record of signaling recessions.
At the same time, easing credit conditions, a strong consumer and unemployment near 50-year low paint a brighter picture that has lifted stocks. Data Thursday showed the services sector is expanding, hiring continues apace and durable goods are being bought. Friday’s employment report trailed forecasts in terms of jobs added but did little to suggest a recession is at hand.
“If you take a step back, you see that the economy isn’t in a terrible shape, just like a year ago,” said Candice Bangsund, portfolio manager at Fiera Capital. “What’s clear is that the central bank isn’t going anywhere and it’s going to backstop the economy.”
After gaining 1.9%, the S&P 500 ended the week roughly one big rally away from its July record of 3,025.86. The index has clocked 12 records in 2019. By this time last year it had closed at 19. While the market’s record of buoyancy is intact, predictions that the country and world are poised for big economic trouble have only gotten louder.
Ray Dalio, the billionaire founder of Bridgewater Associates, said there’s about a 25% chance of a U.S. recession this year and in 2020 and that central bankers will be limited in addressing it. DoubleLine Capital’s Jeffrey Gundlach forecasts a 40%-45% chance of recession in the next six months and 65% in the next year.
Standing against those views are the actions of the Fed, whose willingness to pump stimulus has helped push the S&P 500 up 19% in 2019. Policy makers cut rates in July for the first time in more than a decade and investors are all but certain another cut is coming this month. Traders are betting the central bank will cut rates by 50 basis points by the end of the year, with a 44% chance of an additional quarter-point cut.
“The biggest difference is the Fed,” said Arthur Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities Corp. “As an operating body, they have changed the tone in the way they look at the world.”"
520,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 06, 2019 05:47PM ET</span>","Mnuchin Asks Goldman, AmEx to Help Small Banks Win Contracts","(Bloomberg) -- Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has told large U.S. banks including  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). and  American Express  Co (NYSE:AXP). they should do more to help black- and women-owned community banks win federal contracts.
Mnuchin in a letter this week asked some of the country’s biggest banks to participate in the Financial Agent Mentor-Protege Program, in which large lenders counsel their smaller rivals -- those with assets of less than $2 billion -- on how to become financial agents for the Treasury Department.
“Our goal is to expand networks within the financial-services industry and to facilitate the inclusion of a broader range of financial institutions in Treasury business opportunities,” Mnuchin said in a letter to banks seen by Bloomberg. “The collective network of America’s banks, large and small, is a national strength that is critical to our functioning economy.”
Treasury’s office of minority women and inclusion is leading the effort, a team that Mnuchin, who previously led a community bank, has said he meets with once a month. An administration official verified the letter.
 Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C). was the first financial-agent bank to participate and worked closely with the Treasury Department to develop the program, according to a case study published by the lender. For the past decade, the New York-based company has managed the Treasury’s OTCnet application, which helps federal agencies accept payments. When it re-bid for the work, the firm included Industrial Bank, a black-owned firm in Washington.
“We hope this program serves as a template and look forward to its continued expansion,” Harold Butler, Citigroup’s head of Treasury and Federal Reserve banking services, said in an emailed statement.
In April, JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co. announced that it was working with Harbor Bank of Maryland and Liberty Bank and Trust Co., two regional black-owned companies, as part of the Treasury program.
A representative from Treasury declined to comment, and officials at Goldman Sachs and American Express said they had no immediate comment.

521,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 06, 2019 05:46PM ET</span>",British Airways Poised to Cancel Flights on Pilot Strike,"(Bloomberg) -- British Airways is preparing to cancel nearly all its flights on Monday and Tuesday after pilots vowed to strike following a breakdown in talks over a new contract, according to a person familiar with the matter.
The U.K. carrier will scrap both short and long-haul destinations, said the person, who asked not be be named because the information isn’t public. A spokeswoman for the airline, which is a unit of IAG (LON:ICAG) SA, declined to comment on any cancellations, but said BA operates about 850 flights a day.
The airline has accused the British Airline Pilots’ Association union of not acting in good faith by making “an eleventh hour inflated proposal” which would cost an additional 50 million pounds ($62 million). Balpa had put forward a new contract proposal and pledged to call off the walkout if management returned to the bargaining table.
Instead, a Balpa spokeswoman said Friday the strike is going ahead. “We’re still open to talking with BA but they have so far refused,” she said. BA said in a separate statement it remains “ready and willing to return to talks with Balpa.” The FT reported the airline later sent an email warning the pilots that anyone who goes on strike will lose generous travel perks for themselves and their families for the next three years.
The strike would be the company’s first involving pilots since the 1970s and could cause travel chaos for customers at the tail end of the busy summer season. The current demands relate to pay, profit sharing, and a share-awards program, and come after cockpit crew took salary cuts in the wake of the financial crisis to help bolster the airline’s finances, according to the union.
The union called for the action after mediated talks with management at the state-backed Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service ended without a deal. Cockpit crews voted to strike by a 93% majority in a poll in July, with the carrier saying the disruption could cost 40 million pounds a day.
Balpa is also campaigning at Ryanair Holdings Plc, where U.K. pilots plan to walk out for an additional seven days. Five days of strikes failed to disrupt schedules or bring the discounter -- which uses many non-unionized pilots on contract -- back to the bargaining table.

522,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 06, 2019 05:41PM ET</span>",Wall St. week ahead: Another recent inversion could provide support for stocks,"By Chuck Mikolajczak
NEW YORK (Reuters) - A decline in interest rates on long-term U.S. government bonds below the average stock dividend yield has received less attention than an inverted Treasury yield curve, but it could be a reason stocks find support after a bruising August.
After the S&P 500 (SPX) suffered its first monthly drop since May, in part because the Treasury curve inversion is seen by many as a harbinger of recession, equities have gotten off to a solid start in September, historically their worst month of the year. The uncommon Treasury bond/dividend yield inversion is providing a level of support.
U.S. Treasury yields have fallen in step with a global bond market rally as the trade war between China and the United States has kept recession fears on the horizon. Negative yields on government debt in countries such as Germany and Japan have also helped to depress those on U.S. Treasuries.
While yields on intermediate-term Treasuries have been below the S&P 500's dividend yield for several months, the long-term 30-year yield (US30YT=RR) inverted at the end of August, the first time since March 2009, when stocks bottomed to mark the start of the current bull run.
""Whether it is the Federal Reserve signaling more cuts in the future or just in general this rally in the bond market, overall lower rates - you would think - put some sort of floor on the market as well,"" said Mark Kepner, equity trader at Themis Trading in Chatham, New Jersey.
(Graphic: Inverted curve of 30-yr Treasury and S&P dividend yield - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/12/5726/5676/Pasted%20Image.jpg)
""It's pretty clear that the $17 trillion in negative-yielding bonds have been a black hole that sucks yields lower and lower in the U.S.,"" said Don Ellenberger, head of multi-sector strategies at Federated Investors in Pittsburgh.
With the dividend yield for the S&P 500 now above that of the 30-year, investors may look to stocks with high dividends for income.
After dropping 1.8% in August, the S&P has gotten off to a fast start in September to completely erase that decline, in part due to gains in sectors such as energy (SPNY) and consumer discretionary (SPLRCD) that contain stocks with high dividend yields.
""There’s a complete disconnect between the stock and bond markets,"" said Terri Spath, chief investment officer at Sierra Mutual Funds in Los Angeles.
""Some people are buying stocks for their dividends and bonds for capital appreciation.""
(Graphic: S&P 500 dividend yield vs US Treasuries - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/12/5732/5682/Pasted%20Image.jpg)
With each of the three major Wall Street indexes coming off monthly declines in August, investors may be tempted to look elsewhere in the short-term as September has been the worst- performing month for each since 1950, according to the Stock Trader's Almanac. The S&P has averaged a monthly decline of 0.5% and the Dow Industrials (DJI) a 0.7% fall in the last month of the third quarter over that time.
But the higher dividend yields compared with government bonds could provide some incentive for stocks. Data from Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research in New York, shows that there have been 31 instances since World War II when the S&P dividend yield exceeded that of the 10-year note. The benchmark index was higher a year later by an average of 22%, gaining in price 74% of the time.
Over the same time period, Stovall found 20 occurrences of the yield on the S&P topping that of the 30-year Treasury. In the following year, the index had risen by an average of 12% while climbing 80% of the time.
""At some point an absolute thing kicks in and you go 'Well, where am I going to get my income from?' and the income- producing stocks, the yielding stocks are an attractive place to go,"" said Thomas Martin, senior portfolio manager at Globalt Investments in Atlanta, Georgia.
Of S&P 500 components, 310 held a dividend yield above that of the 10-year note (US10YT=RR), while 333 stocks' yields were above the 5-year (US5YT=RR) and 253 had yields higher than that of the 30-year bond through Wednesday's close.
Recent inversions along the yield curve have triggered worries about an economic slowdown, as they have preceded each recession since 1970.
(Graphic: U.S. Yield Curve - http://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/4/168/168/U.S.%20Yield%20Curve%20Inversion.png)
Should a recession take place, stocks will decline and companies could also begin to cut dividends in an effort to conserve cash, further denting their attractiveness to investors.
""If in fact Treasury yields are forecasting a recession, then you’d prefer to own Treasuries at lower yields because equities are likely to sell off,"" said Erik Knutzen, CIO of Multi Asset Class at Neuberger Berman in New York.
However, a recent note from Bank of America-Merrill Lynch Global Research's Savita Subramanian recommended investors stick with stocks over bonds over both the short and long-term, in part due to their dividend yield and relative cheapness over bonds, while also noting fewer than half of their bear market signals have been triggered.
""For long-term investors, valuations suggest 6% annual returns; add 2% for dividends and this beats most fixed income offerings,"" said Subramanian."

526,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 06, 2019 04:22PM ET</span>","Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac shares tumble as Treasury overhaul plan disappoints","By Michelle Price and Svea Herbst-Bayliss
(Reuters) - Shares of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac slumped on Friday amid disappointment over a long-awaited U.S. Treasury Department plan to begin recapitalizing the mortgage giants and return them to private control after their bailout during the 2008 financial crisis.
Preferred shares of Fannie (PK:FNMAS) were down 7.9% Friday early afternoon and Freddie Mac preferreds (PK:FMCKJ) slid about 8.8%, on track for their biggest daily percent slump since July 18.
The plan, released on Thursday, outlined a raft of administrative and legislative recommendations for overhauling Fannie and Freddie, which guarantee more than half of all U.S. mortgages and are known as government sponsored entities, or GSEs.
Investors and analysts said the plan, presented in a 53-page report, left many questions unanswered, failing to provide the concrete timelines or a recapitalization plan that many had hoped for.
“There was a build up of expectations that was never going to be met by this type of report,” Isaac Boltansky, director of policy research at Washington-based Compass Point Research & Trading, told Reuters on Friday. Though an important first step on the long-road to overhauling Fannie and Freddie, the report ""delivered less than what some investors hoped for,"" he added.
In March, President Donald Trump asked the Treasury to quickly develop a plan for overhauling Fannie and Freddie, the first major effort to jump-start housing finance reform after a failed 2012 attempt by the Obama administration.
Many investors had had high hopes that the plan, which has been led by Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, would recommend swift and bold actions to recapitalize Fannie and Freddie, remove them from conservatorship and start delivering returns for private shareholders.
While the Treasury holds warrants representing 80% of Fannie and Freddie’s common stock, as well as senior preferred stock, a handful of hedge funds also have stakes in both classes of securities. They have lobbied the Trump administration to take up housing reform, arguing the conservatorship has allowed the Treasury to illegally seize Fannie and Freddie's profits. Some hedge funds have sued the government over the conservatorship.
Hedge fund investors in Fannie and Freddie include William Ackman’s Pershing Square (NYSE:SQ) Capital Management, Bruce Berkowitz’s Fairholme Funds Inc, and John Paulson's Paulson & Co, according to people familiar with the matter. Berkowitz wrote to his shareholders in late July, arguing, ""It is now time for Fannie and Freddie ... to keep what is rightly earned, recapitalize, and exit conservatorship.”
Ackman, whose fund owns both common and preferred shares, wrote to his investors last month saying he was ""disappointed"" by what he saw as a delay in the Treasury's plan but that he was optimistic it was still the administration's priority to end the conservatorships and recapitalize the GSEs.
None of the hedge funds were immediately available for comment on Friday, while other investors said they were still digesting the plan. Some analysts and investors were skeptical that Congress would take up the Treasury's call to undertake a comprehensive housing reform, expecting only incremental administrative changes instead.
""The equity market was clearly disappointed,"" said another hedge fund manager with holdings in the firms who declined to be identified. ""I think the market is generally discounting parts of the report that would require legislative approval.""
NO CAPITAL PLAN
Many investors had hoped the Treasury would provide a clear recapitalization plan that would allow the mortgage companies to start retaining the majority of their earnings. In particular, they hoped the Treasury would recommend ending an arrangement, allowed under the preferred share agreements, whereby the Treasury sweeps Fannie and Freddie's net quarterly profits into its coffers.
The report, however, recommends only that the government ""consider permitting"" them to retain more than the $3 billion in capital currently allowed, adding that any capital plan will have to be carefully negotiated with the Federal Housing Finance Agency, which oversees the pair.
""On the bearish front, this report did not signal the immediate end of the net worth sweep, was purposefully amorphous regarding the recapitalization process, and left many key questions unanswered,"" Boltansky wrote in a note on Friday.
Despite such disappointment, the excitement generated by the administration's vow to address housing finance reform has already reaped rewards for some hedge funds, with preferred shares in Fannie and Freddie up around 67% for the year.
Ackman said in August the securities' gains this year helped fuel strong returns at Pershing Square Holdings fund, which has gained 54% this year."

New York (Reuters) - Wall Street's major indexes edged higher on Friday as investors digested mixed signals from the U.S. jobs report and bet on a Federal Reserve interest rate cut this month while China's stimulus plan helped ease some concerns around global growth.
U.S. job growth slowed more than expected in August, with retail hiring declining for a seventh straight month, but this was countered by strong wage gains which are expected to support consumer spending and keep the economy expanding moderately amid rising threats from trade tensions.
Also on Friday, speaking at the University of Zurich, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said the labor market was strong and the central bank will continue to ""act as appropriate"" to sustain economic expansion. He also said the United States and the world economy are not likely to fall into recession.
""There's no question momentum in the labor market is waning a little,” said Moira McLachlan, senior investment strategist at AB Bernstein in Miami. ""I don't think there's anything in there to undermine the case for a rate cut in September.""
Others said the mixed data gave the Fed options.
""If the Fed is bent on becoming more dovish, the jobs data coming in shy of expectations feeds into that narrative and if they want to become more neutral, the wage inflation increasing above expectations strengthens that narrative,"" said Keith Buchanan, portfolio manager at Globalt in Atlanta.
Also on Friday, China's central bank said it would slash the amount of cash that banks must hold as reserves, releasing a total of 900 billion yuan ($126.35 billion) in liquidity to shore up the flagging economy.
At 3:04PM ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) was up 81.52 points, or 0.31%, at 26,809.67, the S&P 500 (SPX) had gained 5.14 points, or 0.17%, to 2,981.14 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) was up 3.17 points, or 0.04%, at 8,120.00.
Of the S&P 500's 11 major sectors healthcare (SPXHC) was the biggest boost with a 0.5% gain. The communication services sector (SPLRCL) was under pressure as  Facebook Inc  (O:FB) slipped 1.6% after U.S. state attorneys general said they would investigate if the social media giant stifled competition and put users at risk.
The Labor Department's nonfarm payroll data showed the economy added 130,000 jobs in August, below expectations for a gain of 158,000, according to a Reuters survey of economists. While average hourly earnings gained 0.4% last month in the largest increase since February, the annual increase dipped to 3.2% from 3.3% in July.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.50-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.13-to-1 ratio favored advancers.
The S&P 500 posted 52 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 57 new highs and 41 new lows."

U.S. stocks held onto slight gains, while Treasuries edged higher as comments by Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell did little to alter the view the central bank will cut rates in two weeks. The dollar fell.
The S&P 500 headed for its second weekly gain after the Fed chief reiterated his stance that a recession is unlikley. Megacap technology stocks weighed on benchmarks after New York opened an antitrust probe into  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB).

Crude erased losses.
“Jobs have been a bit of a roller coaster these past few months. Today’s miss along with downward revisions for the prior two months solidifies that jobs gains are moderating,” said Mike Loewengart, vice president of investment strategy at E*TRADE Financial. “And it’s below expectations and depressed enough to fuel the Fed’s drive to cut rates this month, so in some ways there is something to like for everyone.”
Elsewhere, China cut the amount of cash banks must hold as reserves, injecting liquidity into an economy facing headwinds to growth. The MSCI Asia Pacific Index headed for its biggest weekly advance since June. The pound trimmed some of its recent gains as political turmoil in Britain dragged on.

For the full-year 2020,  Zoom Video Communications  Inc. (NASDAQ:ZM) lifted its earnings per share to a range of $0.18 to $0.19 on sales of $587 million to $590 million, above an earlier estimate for earnings per share of $0.02 to $0.03 on revenue of between $535 million and $540 million.
With shares of Zoom boasting gains of nearly 250% since going public at $36, the upbeat forecast was brushed off, with   Credit Suisse   (SIX:CSGN) maintaining its neutral rating on the company, flagging a frothy valuation. Zoom Video shares fell nearly 4%. 
“We remain neutral, due to ZM’s premium valuation and embedded high expectations,”  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) said in a note. 
Zoom Video’s guidance boost for the fiscal year was underpinned by better-than-expected earnings on both the top and bottom lines. 
The company reported fiscal-second-quarter earnings of 8 cents a share on revenue of $145.8 million, above consensus estimates from Investing.com for earnings of 1 cent a share on revenue of $130.3 million. 
A rise in both customer additions and expansions supported the uptick in revenue, with the company adding a record 7,800 net new customers in the quarter. In the first quarter, Zoom said it earned 3 cents a share on revenue of about $123 million.
Looking ahead,  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) said it expected Zoom Phone – a unified app for phone, video, meetings, and chat – to build on its success, driving further users to the platform. 
“Though it is still early innings, we believe existing customer interest into Zoom Phone’s differentiation as signs of potential future success among Zoom’s existing customer base,”  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) said. ""Additionally, we believe potential new partnerships with those such as Verizon (NYSE:VZ) could drive further uptake for Zoom Phone and the overall Zoom UCaaS platform.”"

SoftBank has a roughly 29% stake in the We Co., WeWork’s parent, said one executive at an analyst call on Wednesday, after the company plowed a total of $10.65 billion into the startup. The Tokyo conglomerate’s massive stake is a vote of confidence in the unprofitable company, which lost about $1.61 billion last year.
Perhaps more than any other startup, WeWork has come to symbolize the brash investment style of SoftBank and its $100 billion Vision Fund, known for making huge bets on promising but unproven companies, and spurring others in the industry to follow suit to compete. The success or failure of WeWork’s initial public offering is likely to be read as a statement on the overall standing of the SoftBank, the judgment of its executives and its ability to raise cash for future ventures.
Now, SoftBank’s big bet may already be turning sour as WeWork mulls an IPO that would peg its worth at less than half its $47 billion valuation when SoftBank invested earlier this year. The New York-based company is now said to be considering a market debut at just $20 to $30 billion, fueling tensions among SoftBank employees.  
The WeWork IPO comes at a critical time for SoftBank, which is currently trying to convince investors to bankroll a second $108 billion iteration of its Vision Fund. The company is already mopping up the fallout from another poorly performing IPO. SoftBank put $7.7 billion into Uber, whose market value promptly fell after shares listed publicly at $45 in May. That price has since fallen to about $35, well below the price SoftBank paid for part of its stake. 
Some staffers at the Vision Fund are now concerned that WeWork’s valuation could fall further, to even below $20 billion—the valuation of SoftBank’s original investment made by the Vision Fund, according to people familiar with the company who asked not to be identified discussing private matters. Because the Vision Fund is so exposed to WeWork, it will play a substantial role in compensation for employees of the fund. People at the Vision Fund are not paid on a deal-by-deal basis, as with some other venture firms. Vision Fund employees, including high-profile bankers and investors, receive base salaries and bonuses, but only get payouts when profits are booked. They are also on the hook for potential losses, facing clawbacks of 20% and above for some senior staff, and 7% for more junior employees. 
There is also a possibility that WeWork could delay its IPO. Adam Neumann, WeWork’s larger-than-life Chief Executive Officer and co-founder, pledged to SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son earlier this year that WeWork will have a valuation of no lower than $47 billion when it goes public, people familiar with the matter said. A SoftBank spokeswoman declined to comment for this story. Neumann also met with Son in Tokyo last week to discuss a potential capital infusion, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing unidentified people familiar with the matter. The possibility of SoftBank investing money to enable WeWork to delay the IPO until 2020 was also raised in the discussions, the paper said.
SoftBank’s massive bet in WeWork is emblematic of Son’s overall approach. “Why don’t we go big bang?” he told Bloomberg in an interview last year when asked about his investing style, and added that other venture capitalists tend to think too small. His goal of swaying the course of history by backing potentially world-changing companies requires that those companies make large outlays in areas from customer acquisition to hiring talent to research and development, a spending tactic that he acknowledged sometimes brings him into conflict with other investors.
“The other shareholders, they try to create clean, polished little companies,” Son said. “And I say: ‘Let’s go rough. We don’t need to polish. We don’t need efficiency right now. Let’s make a big fight. Let’s make a big, successful—a big win.’”
Sometimes, though, the other investors he comes in conflict with are his own. The Vision Fund’s backers, particularly Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund and Abu Dhabi's Mubadala Investment Co., scuttled a $16 billion investment early this year in WeWork that Son had championed, something Son alluded to in an interview with CNBC in March. SoftBank ended up making only a $2 billion investment separately from the Vision Fund.
SoftBank’s huge bet on WeWork has also caused friction between members of the Tokyo company itself. While Son has the final say on investments, WeWork is seen internally as the bet of Ron Fisher, the Boston-based SoftBank executive and a longtime aide to Son, the people said. Fisher, who grew up in South Africa, was SoftBank’s highest-paid executive with $31 million in compensation in the last fiscal year, 62% more than a year earlier. 
Before SoftBank first invested in WeWork in 2017,  Fisher met with executives at IWG Plc, a European competitor with a much lower valuation and⁠—at the time⁠—10 times as many sites, people with direct knowledge of the matter said. Some Vision Fund employees were surprised when instead of convincing Fisher not to invest in WeWork, the unfavorable metrics seemed to encourage him, leaving him convinced that tremendous growth lay ahead for the fledgling company. Son agreed. A month later, the Vision Fund led a $4.4 billion investment round into WeWork at a $20 billion valuation. Fisher and Mark Schwartz, the former Asia Pacific chairman at  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). who was appointed to SoftBank’s board that year, joined WeWork’s board. 
WeWork, by far the largest in the grouping of SoftBank's real estate investments, serves as the linchpin of Son’s broader strategy around real estate. In all the sectors where SoftBank makes big bets, including financial services, transportation, health, and others, it believes that too many small companies with outdated technology drag down the industry, creating opportunities for bigger, updated iterations. SoftBank has also backed startups like brokerage-services provider Compass, mortgage lender Social Finance Inc. and construction-tech firm Katerra Inc., with the belief that these companies could funnel business to each other and boost growth in the sector overall.
But Fisher and Son’s plans weren’t wholeheartedly shared by investors in the Vision Fund. That’s part of the reason that SoftBank’s WeWork stake is split between SoftBank itself and its giant tech fund. Of SoftBank’s 114 million WeWork shares, about 64 million are owned by the Vision Fund, and the rest by SoftBank Group, according to financial filings. Once SoftBank completes a contract that will result in it buying more shares next year, SoftBank Group’s stake will increase to roughly the same as the Vision Fund’s, the filings said. A spokeswoman for SoftBank declined to comment on the reasons behind splitting the stake.
In its results for the quarter ended in June, SoftBank said the Vision Fund’s fair value was $82.2 billion. The cost of the investments in the most recent results was $66.3 billion, up from $60.1 billion the prior quarter, and the fair value doesn’t reflect the Vision Fund’s handful of exited investments such as the 146.68 billion yen the Vision Fund made when it sold its stake in the Indian retailer Flipkart to Walmart (NYSE:WMT) last year. 
For the most part, the fair value includes the portfolio companies that have held IPOs, because the Vision Fund typically holds onto most of its shares rather than selling them in the IPO, as was the case with Uber (NYSE:UBER). That means as the price of those listed shares declines, the drop will hit the Vision Fund’s fair value in the next reported results. The Vision Fund will be able to book some increases due to successes like Guardant Health, a portfolio company that listed last year with a steadily rising stock price, but that still falls far short of offsetting the expected declines in other holdings. Similarly, any decline in that valuation at WeWork’s listing will hit the Vision Fund’s fair value. 
Son, a famously long-term thinker who has outlined 30- and 300-year plans for humanity, could conceivably brush off a poor showing for WeWork as a bump along the long road toward changing the world. It's not clear the Vision Fund will be able to do the same."

British Airways' pilots are set to strike on Monday and Tuesday, threatening to severely disrupt the airline and the travel plans of its customers who have been forced to rebook trips.
Pilots union BALPA has said that British Airways should share more of its profits with its pilots. British Airways has said that the strike action is unjustifiable as its pay offer is fair and that the action will destroy the travel plans of tens of thousands of customers.
""Our view is that nobody should have their travel plans disrupted or their holidays ruined and the unions and BA need to get round the table and sort this out,"" Johnson's spokeswoman said. ""The public would expect nothing less.""
British Airways said in a statement late on Friday: ""We remain ready and willing to return to talks with BALPA.""

On Thursday, BA dismissed a proposal by a pilots union to avoid strike action next week as ""unrealistic"", leaving it little closer to resolving the dispute. BALPA had said it would call off the strikes this week if BA had engaged with the offer.

SAN FRANCISCO/BERLIN (Reuters) -  Qualcomm Inc  (O:QCOM) promised on Friday to bring 5G mobile phones to the masses with a high-end modem and said its chips would also power mid-price devices hitting the market next year.
Fifth-generation chipsets from Qualcomm, the world's biggest supplier of mobile phone chips, now run on five devices from Samsung Electronics (KS:005930), including the $1,299 Galaxy S10 5G model and the new $2,000 Galaxy Fold.
Samsung, the world's top smartphone seller, has also put Qualcomm chips in its lower-priced A90 5G model, which had used Samsung chips in an earlier version.
Qualcomm President Cristiano Amon predicted such devices would achieve volume and scale.
""The transition to 5G is going to be faster than earlier transitions,"" Amon told Reuters on the sidelines of the IFA consumer electronics fair in Berlin. ""Now we have to bring it to everyone.""
More than 20 network operators and a similar number of smartphone makers - from the United States to Europe to China - are launching 5G services and handsets. Amon estimated there were 2.2 billion mobile users that could upgrade.
Such bullishness contrasts with the challenges faced by China's Huawei Technologies, the No.2 smartphone seller behind Samsung that also unveiled its 5G chipset at IFA.
Huawei's consumer business chief Richard Yu touted the Kirin 990 chipset at IFA as the ""most powerful"" and superior to Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 series.
Due to U.S. trade sanctions, Huawei's 5G-ready Mate 30 smartphone range to be launched on Sept. 19 could be hobbled because it won't be able to run the official version of Google's Android operating system and app services.
MASS APPEAL
Until now, Qualcomm typically supplied 5G chips from its most expensive line, Snapdragon 8, which on Friday was showcased with a more powerful X55 5G modem delivering speeds of up to 7 gigabits per second.
It now plans to add 5G capabilities to lower-cost Snapdragon 6 and 7 series devices, which could make 5G phones available more cheaply than the current mostly premium models.
Qualcomm's 6 and 7 series Snapdragon chips are found in devices from Lenovo Group Ltd's (HK:0992) Motorola (NYSE:MSI),  Xiaomi  Corp (HK:1810), Oppo and Vivo that retail in the $300 range. 
Analysts say faster 5G networks will spur many consumers to upgrade their phones after years of market stagnation, although 5G devices are coming to some markets before networks are completed.
""Qualcomm have done a phenomenal job to drive the 5G ecosystem,"" said industry analyst Paolo Pescatore. ""It's going faster than anyone could have ever imagined.""
That puts a premium for Qualcomm on partnering with carriers to market new devices. It's typical for operators to market subsidized handsets in the United States, but less so in Europe.
In Germany, Deutsche Telekom (DE:DTEGn) switched on its 5G network in five cities this week, marketing the Snapdragon-powered Samsung Galaxy S10 5G to early adopters.
FULL SPECTRUM
Qualcomm was early to market 5G modem chips to connect phones to networks but faces intense competition. Taiwan-based MediaTek Inc (TW:2454) also announced a 5G smartphone chip this year.
Qualcomm is positioning itself to be compatible with the full range of frequencies deployed by regulators to run 5G.
These include so-called 'sub-6', or spectrum below 6 Gigahertz that has been predominantly auctioned by European governments making an early start on the shift to 5G.
The United States has auctioned more millimeter wave frequencies with a shorter range but higher data-carrying capacity needed to realize the full range of uses of 5G, such as autonomous driving.
Unlike rivals, Qualcomm is designing its chipsets to handle frequencies ""from A to Z"", said Amon, adding that flexibility to switch between 4G networks and new 5G networks was critical.
Chips from  Mediatek  can only handle sub-6 bands, reducing the cost and complexity of the chips and phone designs.

But it means the phones cannot take full advantage of networks from U.S. carriers such as  Verizon Communications  Inc (N:VZ) and AT&T Inc (N:T) that use millimeter wave technology.

LONDON (Reuters) - Unregulated British firm Financial.org has closed down, according to a notice on its website, and four investors said their accounts had been frozen.
Reuters reported in January 2018 https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-investment-financial-org-excl/exclusive-unregulated-british-firm-draws-asian-investors-idUSKBN1EZ1ME that the company, a former sponsor of motor racing team Williams (NYSE:WMB), was managing hundreds of thousands of dollars for Asian investors even though regulators said it was not licensed to engage in such financial services.
""We have stopped operation,"" says a notice on Financial.org's site which went up in early September.
Reuters was unable to contact Financial.org. Its website no longer contains contact details.
Britain's financial regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, declined to comment about the closure notice.
Financial.org previously said on its site that it was an educational platform with 200,000 members and does not handle any investments, transactions or funds.
Financial watchdogs in Britain, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and the United Arab Emirates have placed the company on alert lists of unauthorized investment firms with whom investors should exercise caution.
The company unilaterally converted investors' dollar accounts into its own FOIN cryptocurrency in June last year and blocked them from withdrawing.
Reuters spoke to four investors from Indonesia, Iran, Japan and Malaysia, via WhatsApp or Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) Messenger, who said they had tried unsuccessfully to withdraw their FOIN last month after being redirected from the Financial.org site to another site, which required a log-in to access.
They said they had received notices in their online accounts, seen by Reuters, telling them they would not be able to access their digital coins until November.
Financial.org launched in September 2016 with a party in Singapore, according to a video posted online.
A spokeswoman for British Formula One team Williams said a sponsorship deal under which the Financial.org and FOIN logos appeared on its cars had expired at the end of 2018 and had not been renewed.
Reception and facilities staff at the building housing Financial.org's headquarters in London's Canary Wharf financial district said the firm moved out of the 26th floor late last year, after renting the space for around two years.
Staff at the building where Financial.org had its Abu Dhabi office also said the firm had moved out. "

Prosecutors had recommended that Air France stand trial over the crash but magistrates overruled the prosecutors and dropped the charges.
Lawyers representing families of victims had also signaled their intention to appeal after the magistrates decision this week.
In their conclusions, seen by Reuters, the judges said the pilots of the Airbus A330 had failed to process all the warnings and instrument readings provided by the aircraft.
The accident was the deadliest in the history of both Air France and the A330.
The plane plunged into the Atlantic ocean en route from Rio de Janeiro to Paris after entering an aerodynamic stall and falling from an altitude of 38,000 feet during a storm, its engines running but its wings losing lift.
It took salvage teams nearly two years to locate the A330's flight recorders on the ocean floor.
A decade later, the aviation industry is still implementing lessons learned from the crash. Changes have focused on training, cockpit procedures and the tracking of aircraft in remote zones.

BASEL, Switzerland (Reuters) - Swiss drugmaker Roche (S:ROG) sees medicines in its own pipeline driving sales growth over the longer term, Chief Executive Severin Schwan told Reuters on Friday, adding he will not pursue takeovers simply to keep revenue rising.
In an interview at Roche's Basel headquarters, Schwan also said ongoing U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) scrutiny of Roche's $4.3 billion takeover of Spark Therapeutics (O:ONCE) came as a surprise, forcing delays.
Roche has twice upgraded 2019 sales forecasts, the latest time to mid- to high-single-digit percentage rate growth, as medicines including Ocrevus for multiple sclerosis and Hemlibra for haemophilia A offset incursions by rivals' copies of its $22 billion-per-year cancer trio Herceptin, Rituxan and Avastin. 
Schwan sees these newer drugs -- combined with late-stage trial hopefuls including for Huntington's disease, lupus and spinal muscular atrophy -- maintaining momentum without forcing him to look beyond Roche's own research departments for help.
""I feel confident that we have a strong pipeline that would support growth in the longer term,"" said Schwan, in his 12th year as CEO.
Roche shares have risen 11% this year, lagging the 20% gain of the Stoxx European Health Care Index (SXDP), as investors continue to worry about rivals' copies taking market share in Europe and increasingly in the United States, Bank Vontobel analysts said in an Aug. 30 note.
Schwan distanced himself from big takeovers, saying M&A to spur growth is too risky.
""I don't think it's a wise strategy in the long term to fill a growth gap by M&A,"" he said. ""If you start filling gaps, you run the risk that you overpay or you take on board assets which do not fit strategically.""
Still, Roche is screening bolt-on technology deals, Schwan said, such as the Spark transaction to add one approved gene therapy, $850,000-per-patient blindness treatment Luxturna, and several others in trials, including for haemophilia A.
The FTC's move to put the Spark transaction under its microscope came unexpectedly, said Schwan, forcing him to abandon original expectations to take ownership by June.
It is now expected by year's end, he said, at identical terms announced in February.
""We thought we should close this relatively quickly without a more-detailed review,"" Schwan said. ""That was not in line with our expectations.""
Completing the Spark deal will likely saddle Roche with some of the same pricing challenges faced by Schwan's Swiss rival  Novartis  (S:NOVN), whose $2.1 million gene therapy Zolgensma for spinal muscular atrophy is the world's costliest one-dose medicine.
Novartis has suggested models in which insurers pay over time, to soften the hit. Spark's gene therapies for rare diseases may also become installment-plan candidates, Schwan said.

""In other words, if the gene therapy works, we agree on a certain annual amount over a defined number of years,"" he said. ""If it should not continue to show the response which was hoped for, then the payment stops.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Despite signs that the U.S. economy is slowing, New York-based  Citigroup  Inc (N:C) is betting big on credit cards.
Citigroup, the third-largest U.S. card issuer, according to payments industry publication The Nilson Report, has been among the most aggressive promoters of zero-interest balance transfers.
For a small fee, customers can move debt from a rival card onto Citi's plastic and pay no interest for 21 months. That is currently the longest 0% deal in the industry, according to consumer finance company Bankrate LLC. Rivals offer 15 interest-free months with no fee.
The card business now accounts for nearly one-third of Citigroup's overall revenue and is one of the biggest potential drivers of future earnings growth.
But some analysts and investors worry this portfolio could become a liability if the economy goes south. The bank continues to advertise zero-interest deals on popular personal finance websites and through mailers, even as competitors have scaled back.
""Just recognizing where we are in the credit cycle, it's interesting to see Citigroup doubling down and pushing forward,"" said Moody's analyst Warren Kornfeld.
Credit card customers who use balance transfers are considered higher risk because they often use the easy financing to accumulate more debt, according to bank analysts and credit underwriters.
Wall Street's worst fears lie with borrowers such as Jacqueline Alvarado, a Pennsylvania truck driver who now owes $12,000. Over the past five years, Alvarado says she has moved balances around on 19 cards, including one from Citigroup, to avoid finance charges. If the promotional offers dry up, she said, so do her hopes of paying off that debt.
Zero interest is ""the only way I can stay afloat,"" said Alvarado, 40.
In interviews with Reuters, Citigroup executives defended their card strategy and tough underwriting standards they say will protect the bank from major losses in the event of a downturn.
Citigroup's card business has reported delinquency rates far below the industry average in recent years, according to federal data and filings. In addition, 83% of consumers in its American credit card business, excluding its retail partnership cards, have credit scores of 680, which is considered a good score, according to credit rating firm Experian.
(For a graphic on Citigroup's credit card delinquencies and charge-offs, see: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/CITI-CREDIT%20CARDS/0H001QES3826/index.html)
TEMPTING BORROWERS
Citigroup counts on customers sticking around after the promotional period expires. With annual percentage rates of up to 27% on its cards, the profits on borrowers who carry balances can be juicy.
The strategy so far is paying off. Interest-bearing balances rose 10% in the second quarter versus the year-ago period. That growth helped boost overall profits on consumer lending by 9%.
Anand Selva, the bank's head of consumer strategy, said he expects the business to continue picking up steam.
Citigroup shares have rallied more than 20% so far this year. The KBW Banking Index, the benchmark stock index for the U.S. banking sector, rose 6% over the same period.
Selva says Citigroup has taken other steps to encourage cardholders to do more than transfer balances. For example, it has sweetened its reward program by offering a new credit card that rounds up to the nearest 10 reward points on every new purchase. And it has introduced installment loans linked to credit lines for large purchases.
Major card rivals, meanwhile, are proceeding more cautiously.
Discover Financial Services (N:DFS), known for flooding mailboxes with promotions, has said on analyst calls that it is paring those offers and tightening personal loan underwriting over concerns the economy is slowing.  Capital One  Financial Corp (N:COF), which pioneered balance transfers in the early 1990s, similarly told analysts and investors it has become more conservative in extending credit lines while targeting wealthier clients who typically do not carry balances.
Bank of America Corp (N:BAC) and JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM), two of the biggest card lenders, have grown their businesses by prioritizing affluent consumers over people already carrying credit card debt, according to analysts.
CARD CRUTCH
Citigroup has leaned more on its card business since the 2007-2009 financial crisis. The bank required three government bailouts when its U.S. subprime mortgage business turned toxic and caused it to shrink its portfolio to stem losses.
It sold its retail wealth management unit to  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS), and it no longer engages in traditional mortgage and auto lending. Citigroup now has one-fifth the number of U.S. branches as its primary competitors.
So it has turned to its card business to drive growth and lure deposits.
The bank now earns more than half of its consumer profit and revenue from cards. And it markets online checking and savings accounts to its 28 million cardholders. Doing so helped Citigroup add $2 billion in consumer deposits during the first half of 2019. That is more than double what it gathered all of last year.
Analysts said the business will be a bright spot for Citigroup - as long as the economy remains healthy. U.S. banks suffered $87 billion in losses on credit card loans from 2009-2010 in the wake of the financial crisis, according to a Federal Reserve report.

541,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 06, 2019 10:54AM ET</span>","Burned and Trapped, Bondholders Dust Off Guide to Flee Argentina","(Bloomberg) -- For the bravest, most risk-tolerant investors out there -- shops like Franklin Templeton and Pimco -- the Argentine trade the past few years was to dive into the local market and scoop up peso-denominated bonds. Paying out interest rates of up to 75%, it was a cash-generating machine.
But now, amid a collapse that has put the country on the verge of default once again, it is these bonds that have taken the worst of it. Not only have they plunged in value just like the country’s dollar notes, but they have also been hammered by a 25% drop in the peso and gotten ensnared by capital controls the government imposed this week. That move, which came in a desperate bid to stabilize the peso, effectively blocked investors from taking money out of the country through traditional foreign-exchange markets.
Which leaves many bond firms nursing losses and searching for alternative ways out. One method has immediately jumped to the fore, the same one used for years to skirt controls during the previous rule of the leftist version of Peronism that now appears poised to retake the presidency next month. It’s called the blue-chip swap and it’s predicated on the purchase -- with pesos -- of certain types of shares or bonds in the local market and the subsequent sale of those securities abroad for dollars. It’s not cheap, though: The effective peso exchange rate is currently about 8% weaker than the going price in the foreign-exchange market.
“Old veterans who used to trade local-currency bonds from beforehand know the score,” said Edwin Gutierrez, London-based head of emerging-market sovereign debt at Aberdeen Asset Management, who said he used the parallel rate during the capital controls implemented by Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner’s government. “It’s a return to the bad old days.”
Beforehand means before President Mauricio Macri, a free-market reformer determined to return the slumping, state-controlled Argentine economy to normalcy, swept into office in 2015. One pledge was to overturn capital controls, and he achieved it in his first week in office. He assembled a star cabinet with Wall Street veterans to settle lawsuits with creditors and return Argentina to foreign bond markets.
Over the next two years, finance officials sold enough local bonds to build a peso bond curve amid the promise of slowing prices. After jacking up rates to among the highest in the world -- the benchmark is now at 86% -- they lured foreign investors like Franklin Templeton’s Michael Hasenstab to place long-term bets on the peso bonds. The money manager kept his bullish stance even as the peso tumbled 50% last year amid growing concern about the outlook for growth and inflation.
Argentina’s carry trade, the practice of buying local notes with borrowed dollars, offered a modest return in 2017 before the rout in 2018. Its performance in the first half of this year was among the world’s best, though it’s now negative for the year.
Some foreign investors, most notably Pacific Investment Management Co., latched onto local floating-rate bonds that track the country’s monetary policy rate, making them the world’s top-paying bond.
Peso Bet
Fund managers including T Rowe Price to VanEck were also among top foreign holders of local currency bonds. The peso notes have underperformed overseas dollar bonds since the currency controls were announced Sunday.
“Many investors thought Argentina was on its way to becoming Chile or Colombia -- stable, investment grade,” said Leo Chialva, a partner at Buenos Aires-based consulting firm Delphos Investment. “Those large funds are horrified by the latest measures.”
It’s hard to know exactly how things worked out for Franklin Templeton or Pimco, and neither firm would discuss how it fared in detail. While Argentina makes up just a small portion of Franklin Templeton’s assets, the Templeton Emerging Markets Bond Fund had its biggest drop since the 2008 financial crisis the day after Argentina’s primary round results. One silver lining: the fixed-rate peso bonds that have Franklin Templeton as the top holder won’t be part of a debt reprofiling plan the government is now proposing.
While Argentina was always a very small part of Pimco’s total assets, the fund manager diversified its holdings in the country “with more downside protection in an extreme market event” and “avoided larger exposures with greater losses that have impacted other major investors,” spokesman Michael Reid said last month.
Under the rules Argentina announced Sunday, exporters must repatriate foreign currency from overseas sales within five days. Corporations will need authorization from the central bank to buy dollars in the foreign-exchange market, except in cases of international trade. Individuals, meanwhile, will be limited to buying no more than $10,000 a month.
“The aim is to protect exchange stability and savers,” Guido Sandleris, the head of the central bank, said the day after bringing back the controls.
The gap between the official exchange rate and the blue-chip swap rate, which was sometimes as large as 40% during the Kirchner years, won’t exceed 10% this time around, Chialva said. That’s because the controls aren’t quite as stringent as they were in the past, especially for individuals. Plus, after dropping 20% since the primaries, the peso is at a fair value given the likelihood of a leftist government winning the presidential ballot next month, he said.
As the blue-chip swap comes back, local brokerage firm Portfolio Personal Inversiones sent out a note for the benefit of newcomers to explain how the system works.
It’s “an expensive but fluid way to convert this trash cash into greenbacks,” the note said."

President Donald Trump has made high prescription drug prices a top issue in the 2016 presidential campaign and said that drug companies were ""getting away with murder"".
Novo will offer a generic version of its most heavily prescribed insulin drug Novolog, used by about a million U.S. patients, at a 50% discount compared to the current list price, the company said in a statement. 
The list price for one vial will be $144.68.
Novo will also introduce a so-called $99 cash card program from Jan 2020, which patients can use to buy three vials or two packs of pens of Novo's analog insulins for a flat cost of $99, which for most diabetics is an adequate supply for one month.
The cost of insulin for treating type 1 diabetes in the United States has nearly doubled over a five-year period, leading some patients to put their own health at risk by rationing the medication.
""While we will continue to do what we can to help address affordability challenges in the short-term, changes within the system are required to make sustainable and meaningful affordability a reality,"" said Novo in a statement. 
In April, France's Sanofi said it would cut the cost of its insulin products to $99 per month for uninsured patients and others who pay cash in the United States.
Eli Lilly started selling a half-price version of its Humalog insulin in May. The list price for Lilly's authorized generic insulin -- sold under the name Insulin Lispro -- is $137.35 per vial.

In April, a U.S. congressional committee called on executives from Novo, Sanofi and Eli Lilly to testify about the rising costs of the lifesaving drug.

Denel, which makes ammunition, missiles and armored vehicles for South Africa and customers elsewhere in Africa, the Gulf and Europe, received a 1.8 billion rand ($122 million) cash injection from the government at the end of last month after struggling to pay salaries and suppliers.
Denel is one of a handful of state-run companies that has needed to be bailed out by the government in recent months. A pillar of the country's once-mighty defense industry, the company recorded a 1.76 billion rand loss in 2018.
Denel has not yet released financial results for the 2018/19 fiscal year, but was projected to be insolvent, according to a presentation to parliament's portfolio committee on public enterprises on Wednesday.
It expects to raise 160 million rand in the third quarter of the 2019/20 financial year via the disposal of equity in Hensoldt Optronics, a producer of high-tech optics such as sensors and radars, in which it owns a 30 percent stake. The fiscal year runs from April 1 to March 31 with an October-to-December third quarter.
Denel CEO Danie du Toit said any deals were subject to government approval but negotiations over Hensoldt were in progress.
""We're on plan,"" he wrote in a text message on Friday.
Exiting its loss making LMT, an armored vehicle business in which it holds a 51% stake, and its small caliber ammunition unit PMP should save it 70 million rand in the same quarter.
Equity sales and partnerships involving core businesses like Denel Land Systems, missile unit Denel Dynamics and Denel Aeronautics should help raise another 4.4 billion rand through 2022.
Streamlining supply chains, reducing staff costs and exiting other businesses, including Denel Aerostructures, could reap 862 million rand in further savings.
In a statement on Thursday, Denel said it foresaw some 30 billion rand in deals over the next two years, including the largest export contract in the company's history.
Denel has not publicly named the customer. But the presentation to parliament says the contract, which includes a 1.5 billion rand advance, focused on Egypt's navy and ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems vessels."

The deal hands Alibaba the biggest Chinese online marketplace for foreign brands after its own Tmall Import and Export. Kaola will now operate independently but under new Chief Executive Officer Alvin Liu, a Tmall veteran. Separately, Alibaba and billionaire co-founder Jack Ma’s Yunfeng Capital will invest $700 million in NetEase Cloud Music. NetEase remains the controlling shareholder of its music app.
Alibaba and NetEase -- both based in the prosperous eastern city of Hangzhou -- have long fought social media titan Tencent Holdings Ltd. across several fronts but the landscape is shifting. The emergence of Tencent-backed rivals like Pinduoduo Inc. is testing Alibaba’s dominance of retail. NetEase has long been a distant runner-up to Tencent in gaming and now also music streaming, while Alibaba has its own music app Xiami. The sale of the low-margin Kaola platform now allows NetEase to focus on its bread-and-butter gaming business.
“NetEase can further optimize its costs while Alibaba strengthens its leadership in cross-border e-commerce,” Thomas Chong and Ken Chong, analysts at Jefferies, wrote Friday. “On the other hand, we believe NetEase Cloud Music can benefit from potential synergies with the Alibaba ecosystem.”
The Kaola deal creates a dominant bazaar for consumers seeking foreign labels and goods. Alibaba and Kaola, which is loss-making on an operational level, controlled almost 60% of all transactions on China-based platforms for foreign brands in the second quarter, according to research firm Analysys.
It also deepens a seeming alliance. NetEase founder William Ding and Alibaba CEO Daniel Zhang exchanged good-natured banter during a long TV interview aired in China just last month. Asked about their rivalry, Ding joked: “Many of our employees might be husbands and wives.”
What Bloomberg Intelligence says:
Alibaba’s $2 billion acquisition of Kaola, NetEase’s cross-border e-commerce platform, will make it the go-to channel for Chinese consumers seeking high-quality foreign products.
The investment will prove welcome to NetEase, which like Alibaba has grappled with rising content costs.
NetEase Music most recently raised $600 million in November when Baidu Inc (NASDAQ:BIDU)., General Atlantic and Boyu Capital participated in a fundraising round. The latest capital injection comes after China’s antitrust authority launched a probe into its much larger rival, Tencent Music Entertainment Group, over its licensing practices. Under government pressure, Tencent Music and NetEase Music last year agreed to relicense more than 99% of their music catalogs to each other.
“What really matters is the 1% exclusive content,” said Shawn Yang, a Shenzhen-based analyst with Blue Lotus. “Now that NetEase has new funding that can be used to buy copyrights, it will definitely be a threat to TME.”"

(Reuters) - The company that owns a scuba dive boat that caught fire and sank off California killing 34 people, may seek to limit its liability by invoking a 19th Century law that has shielded vessel owners from costly disasters such as the sinking of the Titanic.
Federal investigators have interviewed https://www.reuters.com/article/us-california-fire/california-boat-fire-investigators-interview-captain-crew-idUSKCN1VP2D2 the only survivors from the fire aboard the Conception, the captain and four crew members, as well as Glen Fritzler, whose Truth Aquatics Inc owns and operates the vessel.
While no one has sued yet, wrongful death lawsuits by families of the victims were a near certainty, legal experts said.
Accidents that occur on land with a similar death toll could lead to more than $100 million in damages, lawyers said.
But on the water, maritime law applies, and any lawsuits will run up against a statute that allows the owner of a vessel and its insurer to escape or severely limit its liability in certain cases.
Experts in maritime law said Truth Aquatics will almost certainly file a petition under the Shipowner's Limitation of Liability Act of 1851. The law is routinely invoked for an accident on a waterway, whether it involves tug boats and barges in busy harbors or leisure boats at vacation hotspots.
Truth Aquatics declined to comment.
The law allows the owner of a vessel to petition a federal court to exonerate it from damages, or limit damages to the post-accident value of the ship, which would be zero in the case of the sunken Conception. An owner has roughly six months to file a petition and can do it before or after it is sued.
""It really is antithetical to most fair-minded people and jurists to allow this old defense to potentially let someone off scot free,"" said Daniel Rose, an attorney with the Kreindler & Kreindler firm which represents victims in maritime accidents.
The 1912 sinking of the Titanic on its maiden voyage, in which more than 1,500 people were killed, is a classic example of the law being successfully employed.
The ship's owner, White Star Lines, was able to limit its liability in lawsuits in the United States to $92,000, which was the value of the lifeboats that survived the accident.
The act requires an owner to show its actions did not cause the accident, or as 19th Century maritime law put it, that the owner lacked ""privity or knowledge"" of the incident. Owners rely on evidence that their ship was properly equipped, the crew well-trained and procedures were being followed.
In the case of the Titanic, the ship was state-of-the-art and deemed unsinkable, and White Star Lines played no part in the captain's navigation into an iceberg.
Circumstances have changed with modern communications, increasing the owner's role in a ship's operation and decreasing the owner's ability to limit liability under the act.
""These days a master won't scratch himself without asking the owner's permission,"" said Martin Davies, who teaches admiralty law at Tulane Law School.
In the case of the Conception, a judge would look for evidence that showed the owner had ""knowledge,"" or some involvement in the accident. The captain and four crew were on deck when the flames erupted early Monday morning and were able to escape in an inflatable life boat, investigators said. One crew member was sleeping below deck with the passengers.
""I think court would look to the competency of the crew, their background, education, what was put on board for firefighting equipment, what training the crew had, what training the passengers had,"" said Michael Karcher, a maritime law specialist with Karcher, Canning & Karcher in Dania Beach, Florida.
The owner will try to pin blame solely on the crew and try to show the accident cannot be linked to something the owner did or should have done, legal experts said.
The Truth Aquatics fleet is moored in Santa Barbara, California, and the Conception was on a three-day excursion to the Santa Cruz Islands.
Judges have been reluctant to apply the law outside purely maritime accidents, especially in high-profile accidents involving tourists, lawyers said.
""The courts are generally not in favor of it,"" said Karcher. ""It’s a fairly high threshold.""
The act was invoked in last year's duck boat accident near Branson, Missouri, which killed 17 people. Even though the judge has yet to rule on the petition to limit liability, many of the victims' claims have settled.
Kreindler attorney Rose said it was not unusual for an owner to try to strike settlements in headline-grabbing cases.
""In a case with egregious facts you don’t want to push too far because they risk raising the ire of the public and people in Congress who maybe take a look at the law anew,"" Rose said."
556,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 06, 2019 07:01AM ET</span>","Trump administration unveils Fannie, Freddie overhaul, urges Congress to act","By Pete Schroeder
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury on Thursday said the government should draw up a plan to begin recapitalizing mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, while calling on Congress to pen a comprehensive housing reform that would allow them to be safely freed from government control.
The Treasury's plan, released in a 53-page report, marks the first major effort to jump-start housing finance reform in Washington after a failed 2012 attempt by the Obama administration.
The report calls for recuperating Fannie and Freddie and removing them from their government lifeline, but it strikes a cautious tone by failing to commit to concrete timelines or a specific recapitalization plan.
It commits to preserving the 30-year fixed rate mortgage, a cornerstone of the U.S. mortgage market, and leans heavily on Congress to implement several critical measures, including the creation of an explicit guarantee for Fannie and Freddie's mortgage-backed securities.
As such, it may disappoint some investors who had been anticipating a speedy overhaul of the mortgage giants and conservative Republicans who had hoped the administration would take bold steps to sever all government ties with the companies.
Instead, the Treasury outlines a series of incremental administrative measures it can take to bolster Fannie and Freddie's finances, reduce their risk to the taxpayer, and shrink their footprint in the secondary mortgage market.
Democrats were quick to criticize the plan, warning it could increase housing costs by limiting access to mortgages to lower-income Americans.
""President Trump’s housing plan will make mortgages more expensive and harder to get,"" Senate Banking Committee ranking Democrat Sherrod Brown said in a statement.
Fannie and Freddie, which guarantee over half the nation's mortgages, have been in conservatorship since they were bailed out during the 2008 financial crisis and Washington has since struggled to agree a plan to get them back on their feet.
The Treasury holds warrants representing 80% of Fannie and Freddie’s common stock, as well as senior preferred stock agreements that allow it to sweep the firms' profits into its coffers. That arrangement has left Fannie and Freddie with just around $3 billion of capital each, leaving taxpayers exposed to future bailouts.
Some investors had hoped the Treasury would provide a clear recapitalization plan that would allow the mortgage firms to start retaining the majority of their earnings. The report, however, recommends only that the government ""consider permitting"" them to retain more than the $3 billion in capital currently allowed.
A senior Treasury official said a specific recapitalization plan would still have to be carefully negotiated with the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), which oversees the mortgage giants. Washington insiders say that negotiation could be highly complicated and legally tricky.
FHFA director Mark Calabria, who told Reuters in July he is eager to end the conservatorship by his the end of his five-year term, called the report an ""important step forward"" in a statement.
The Treasury hopes that parallel to negotiating a capital plan with FHFA, Congress will be spurred to take up broader housing reforms in the coming months. Most importantly, it called for Congress to create an explicit guarantee for the companies' mortgage-backed securities, although Washington housing lobbyists see such action as unlikely in the near term.
""My preference is to fix the housing finance system through legislation and I look forward to working with all of my colleagues as we move forward,"" U.S. Senator Mike Crapo, chairman of the Senate banking committee, said in a statement.
If Congress fails to create a new guarantee, the Treasury said it would use its existing investment in the companies to continue serving as a backstop, signaling it may be prepared to stand behind the companies indefinitely.
In March, President Donald Trump asked the Treasury to develop a plan for housing finance reform, wading into one of the most politically fraught, technically challenging, and economically thorny issues in Washington ahead of the 2020 election.
As the administration digs into the detail, it will have to navigate the concerns of powerful lobby groups representing bankers, realtors, homebuilders, as well consumer advocates and fair lending groups, which could ultimately scuttle its plan.
""I'm urging the President: Make it easier for working people to buy or rent their homes, not harder,"" said Brown in his statement."

By 5 AM, the benchmark Euro Stoxx 600 was largely unchanged at 385.98 but still on course for a weekly gain of nearly 2% after Thursday’s rally. It’s now made good nearly all the losses incurred since President Donald Trump’s fateful tweet at the start of August which triggered a round of tit-for-tat escalations of the trade war.
By the same token, the German DAX was up 0.1%, also at its highest since early August, while the FTSE 100 was unchanged.
Luxury names outperformed on more signs of a potential de-escalation of the protest in Hong Kong, which accounts for a disproportional amount of sales and profit at groups such as Burberry and Gucci owner Kering.
Elsewhere, all was becalmed, with another set of gloomy German industrial production data keeping any optimism firmly in check. With incoming orders to German factories also falling in July, the first “hard” data of the third quarter from Europe’s largest economy have pointed clearly to a second straight quarter of contraction in the summer.
“Since reunification there have been four comparable industrial setbacks of which three ended in a recession,” Allianz economist Katharina Utermoehl said via Twitter. However, she pointed to one key difference with the last recession in 2008/9, which is that the addition of 6 million jobs to the German economy in the last decade has left consumption structurally stronger.
With no turnaround in sight in the euro zone economy (second-quarter GDP growth was confirmed at 0.2% on Friday), much is now resting on the outcome of the European Central Bank’s policy meeting next week.
“Even if (the German data) come too late to be incorporated into next week’s official ECB forecasts, it will be another argument for ECB members in favor of new monetary stimulus,” said Carsten Brzeski.
Most analysts expect the ECB to cut its discount rate by 0.1% or 0.2%, and to adjust the price of its new long-term loans to as to keep short-term interest rates anchored lower. The big open question is whether it will renew its purchases of bonds, given that a vocal minority of central bankers from Germany, Austria and the Netherlands have all voiced resistance to the idea in the last week."

SEOUL (Reuters) - General Motors Co's (N:GM) unionized workers in South Korea will strike Monday to Wednesday over stalled wage talks and concern of another plant shutdown, union officials said on Friday, the first full walkout since GM bought local factories in 2002.
The decision came after the union rejected GM's proposal for a base wage freeze and no bonuses for a second year in a row.
Last year, the government injected 850 billion won ($712.85 million) into the money-losing unit after the U.S. automaker considered pulling out of the country. GM shut one of its four Korean factories following its pullback from major export market Europe and cut around 3,000 jobs.
The government at the time said the injection would keep GM in South Korea for at least another 10 years. Even so, union officials continue to be concerned about further closures and job losses.
GM has not offered any production plan for No.2 plant in the city of Bupyeong after 2022, union officials said.
GM Korea has said it will shift production of its Trax crossover to the plant from another nearby factory starting late this year. It did not provide longer term plan when contacted by Reuters.
On Monday,  Hyundai Motor  Co's (KS:005380) unionized workers in South Korea voted to accept the lowest bonus offered in nearly two decades, with the union mindful of GM's restructuring and a trade dispute with Japan clouding the economic outlook.
""What crazy person will stage a full strike for three days under this economic situation? We are going on a strike because we are desperate,"" said a GM Korea union leadership official.
""We are fine with no wages, but we want to hear GM's vision about the Korean unit,"" said the official, who declined to be identified due to the sensitivity of the matter.
GM said it aims to break even in Korea this year for which it needs union cooperation.
""It is unfortunate that the union decided to go on strike. The company has been delivering on commitments and we ask the union to do the same for the future of GMK,"" GM Korea (GMK) said in a statement on Monday.
GM began production in South Korea after buying assets of failed local automaker Daewoo Motor in 2002. It has since only suffered partial strikes, with workers walking out for several hours during annual wage talks. Monday would mark the first time GM's Korean plants will be idle for a full day due to a labor dispute."

LONDON (Reuters) - Stimulus from China capped a strong week for global share markets on Friday, while bond buyers and dollar dealers were waiting for U.S. jobs data after their first significant selloffs in months.
After a roller-coaster week dominated by UK and Italian political drama, Washington and Beijing trade talk, global monetary stimulus and Argentina's imposing capital controls, calm looked to have returned. Then Beijing cut in.
As Chinese markets were closing, the country's central bank said it was slashing the amount of cash that banks must hold as reserves for the third time this year. That released a total of 900 billion yuan ($126.35 billion) to shore up the slowing economy. 
Europe's pan-region Stoxx 600, London FTSE, Paris CAC 40 and DAX in Frankfurt were all higher, after rising to their highest in more than month on Thursday. 
Euro zone bond yields steadied after their worst one-day selloff in more than a year. The euro and pound saw weekly gains after the biggest drop for the dollar in a month. 
""It feels to me like the air is coming out of it a bit,""  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) strategist Kit Juckes said, referring to the recent surge in volatility. ""So we will see what we get from the payrolls.""
The closely watched U.S. non-farm payrolls report due at 1230 GMT was expected to show 158,000 jobs were added in August and the unemployment rate was unchanged at 3.7%.
Surveys on Thursday had suggested the U.S. may be in better shape than investors have been fearing. Services activity accelerated in August and private employers increased hiring more than expected.
Despite the reassuring signs, bond markets still expect the Federal Reserve to cut U.S interest rates this month and a total of 55 basis points of cuts by the end of the year. 
Overnight, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan added 0.6%, giving it a 2.4% weekly gain, its best week since mid-June.
United States and China agreed to hold high-level talks early in October, raising hopes for their long trade conflict would be resolved.
The Shanghai Composite Index ended up 0.5% and Hong Kong's Hang Seng rose 0.6%, even though the rating agency Fitch downgraded the city's credit rating after months of unrest.
Australian stocks gained 0.5%, South Korea's KOSPI climbed 0.2% and Japan's Nikkei advanced 0.5%. On Thursday, Wall Street's Dow added 1.4%, the S&P 500 climbed 1.3% and Nasdaq rose 1.75%.
""The strong U.S. data are the main part of the latest turn in markets as they are key factors impacting equities and U.S. yields, therefore determining how long this 'risk on' phase will last,"" said Junichi Ishikawa, senior FX strategist at IG Securities in Tokyo. 
The August payrolls report ""will get more attention than usual as it could further fuel the risk-on phase, which in turn would boost the dollar,"" Ishikawa said. 
Despite its broader decline, the dollar stood at 107.04 yen after climbing to a one-month high of 107.235 overnight.
The pound rose to $1.23 from the near-six-week peak of $1.2353 it reached after Britain's parliament moved to block a UK departure from the European Union without a transitional agreement. It had fallen to a three-year low of $1.1959 midweek amid threats of a no-deal Brexit.
The euro was steady at $1.1039 after rising 0.5% overnight, when it was helped by the Brexit drama and the sagging dollar.
U.S. Treasuries fell in price and their yields rebounded from multi-year lows as investors moved out of safe assets into equities.
The 10-year Treasury yield was 1.536%, up from a three-year low of 1.428% in midweek, when soft economic data and Sino-U.S. trade worries stoked global recession concerns.
""The recent panic in markets was excessive. And if a sustained reversal of fragile sentiment gets under way, U.S. equities will test fresh record highs and a corresponding drop in bond prices will present an good bargain-hunting opportunity,"" said Eiichiro Tani, chief strategist at Daiwa Securities.

In commodities markets, Brent oil futures were little changed at $60.97 per barrel. Brent had climbed to a one-month peak of $62.40 per barrel on Thursday after data showed U.S. crude stockpiles decline and the news about U.S.-China trade talks.

563,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 06, 2019 05:25AM ET</span>",Huawei shows off 'most powerful' chipset as forges ahead with 5G smartphone plan,"By Douglas Busvine
BERLIN (Reuters) - Huawei Technologies showcased its chipset for a new high-end smartphone on Friday, pressing ahead with plans to launch its Mate 30 range, despite uncertainty about whether the new phones will be able to run Google's Android operating system and apps.
The Chinese tech giant bills the Kirin 990 chipset as the first all-in-one 5G system on a chip, describing it as superior to alternatives from Qualcomm (O:QCOM) and Samsung (KS:005930) that, it says, graft 5G modems on to 4G chips.
""It’s the world’s most powerful 5G system on a chip. It’s the world’s most powerful 5G modem,"" Richard Yu, the head of Huawei’s consumer business group, said in a speech in Berlin.
Huawei's launch at the IFA consumer electronics fair in Berlin of the Kirin 990, made using the latest 7 nanometer production process, is part of a carefully sequenced buildup to the Sept. 19 international launch of the Mate 30 in Munich.
Yet, say Huawei sources, it is still not known whether the Mate 30 will be able to run services from Alphabet's Google (O:GOOGL) following the blacklisting of the Chinese company by the U.S. administration in May.
That ban sliced 5 percentage points off Huawei's market share in Europe.
The world's No.2 smartphone maker is looking to reclaim ground as the spread of ultra-fast 5G networks prompts an upgrade cycle among consumers who have been holding on to phones for longer. Consumers will need new handsets to take advantage of the ultrafast download speeds promised by 5G.
NO GOOGLE, NO JOY
The services in doubt include pre-installing the Google Play store and a suite of popular apps such as Google Maps that buyers would expect to be available from the moment they turn on their new phone and synch it with their profile.
Huawei's fallback option would be to run the devices on its home-grown Harmony operating system, although company officials and analysts say it is not yet ready for prime time.
""The elephant in the room is Google,"" said Peter Richardson of Counterpoint Research, after attending a technical briefing on the Kirin 990 by Huawei managers that skirted the issue and focused only on the chipset's specifications.
The Kirin 990 packs more than 10 billion transistors and can support downlink speeds of up to 2.3 gigabits per second.
It has an adaptive receiver that enables it to switch between 4G and 5G where coverage of the faster technology is weak.
And, to save energy, it has a 'big core' to handle powerful computing tasks with the support of artificial intelligence, and a 'tiny core' for less demanding operation.
Huawei plans only to use the Kirin 990 in its own devices, meaning it lacks the marketing opportunities enjoyed by Qualcomm, whose chips already power the Samsung 5G phones, such as the Galaxy 10, already on the market.
Apple's recent settlement of a patent dispute with Qualcomm, and Intel's (O:INTC) exit from the smartphone modem business also reflect the U.S. chipmaker's muscle in a global market that is increasingly fragmenting due to the U.S.-China trade tension.
""Qualcomm has a scale advantage,"" said Ben Wood, analyst at CCS Insight. ""Huawei's commitment to continue innovating on silicon is really impressive, especially given the geopolitical headwinds they are facing. 

""But at the end of the day, it's a single-vendor solution. And, even if they had aspirations to sell the chipset, that is getting more difficult all the time.""

564,By Investing.com,"<span>Sep 06, 2019 05:25AM ET</span>",Day Ahead: The Top 3 Things to Watch,"Investing.com - Here are the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow.
1. Fed Fallout to Continue? 
Following the late selloff in markets Wednesday, Fed Chairman Jay Powell's unexpected hawkish remarks are likely to continue to have an impact Thursday as traders rein in expectations for future rate cuts. 
Powell said the Fed's decision to cut rates was not the beginning of a long series of rate cuts, throwing into doubt investor expectations that more easing would follow. He clarified that Wednesday's cut was not a one-time move.
Particular attention will be on the bond market, where expectations of future easing dissipated.
And investors will also be wary of President Donald Trump, who tweeted Wednesday afternoon, ""As usual, Powell let us down."" What the President wanted, he said in his tweet, was a signal the Fed was starting ""a lengthy and aggressive rate-cutting cycle which would keep pace with China, The European Union and other countries around the world.""
Trump has suggested in the past he might replace Powell. Powell has said he can't be fired and plans to serve out his four-year term as Fed chairman.
2. General Motors Earnings Pull In
General Motors (NYSE:GM) is set to report earnings before markets open on Thursday. 
Ahead of the earnings, the automaker provided a dour update that put the brakes on performance expectations for the quarter, reporting a 1.5% decline in deliveries amid weaker sales of its volume-selling Chevrolet brand.
GM is expected to report earnings of $1.43 a share on revenue of $36.11 billion. 
Guidance will also come into focus, with GM in April saying it was on track to deliver full-year adjusted earnings per share between $6.50 and $7.
GM was off a modest 0.2% on Wednesday. It finished July with a 4.7% gain and is up 20.6% on the year.
3. U.S. Manufacturing, Labor, Construction Data on Watch
At 8:30 AM ET, the Labor Department releases its weekly jobless claims report: the estimate of the number of individuals who filed for unemployment insurance for the week ended July 27. 
Economists forecast that initial jobless claims increased to 212,000 from 206,000 the week before.
The data comes ahead of the all-important nonfarm payrolls report due Friday. 
At 10:00 AM ET, the Institute of Supply Management will release its measure of manufacturing activity for July.
The ISM manufacturing purchasing manager’s index (PMI) is predicted to have increased to a reading of 52 from 51.7 in its June report. 
Construction spending data will follow on the heels of the manufacturing data, with economists forecasting spending rebounded 0.8% in June from the prior month. "
565,By Investing.com,"<span>Sep 06, 2019 05:25AM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top-3 Things to Watch,"Investing.com – Here’s a preview of the top-three things that could rock markets tomorrow. 
1 It's Jobs Friday!
The U.S. economy is anticipated to have produced slightly fewer jobs in August from the previous month.
The Labor Department will release its latest jobs figures at 8:30 AM ET (12:30 GMT).
Economists expect that nonfarm payrolls rose by 160,000 last month, according to forecasts compiled by Investing.com. That would be down from the 164,000 rise seen in July.
The unemployment rate is forecast to remain steady 3.7%.
The weaker backdrop in U.S. manufacturing and retail, bankruptcies in the shale industry and falling demand for long-haul truck drivers are expected to keep a lid on job growth, said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton.
Wages are expected to rise 0.3% in August, the same as July, but to fall slightly to 3.1% year on year.
“The good news is that much of the acceleration in wages we are now seeing is occurring among the lowest paid workers, which shows up almost immediately as consumer spending,” Swonk added.
2. Oil Rig Count Rolls In
Traders will look to the latest rig-count data due Friday for clues on crude production activity as U.S. production remained close to record levels at 12.4 million barrels a day last week. 
Data last week showed the number of oil rigs operating in the U.S. fell by 12 to 742.
The weekly rig count is an important barometer for the drilling industry and serves as a proxy for oil production and oil services demand.
Oil prices, on track for a second-straight weekly win, have been buoyed by easing U.S.-China trade tensions and ongoing signs of tightening domestic supplies after data showed U.S. inventories declined by more than expected last week.
3. Powell & Co. Take to the Stage
Fed Chairman Jerome Powell will speak on Friday in Switzerland. Powell will be accompanied by other panel speakers including, Fed Governor Michelle Bowman and four regional presidents: Boston Fed's Eric Rosengren, New York Fed's John Williams, Minnesota Fed's Neel Kashkari and Chicago Fed's Charles Evans.
With expectations running high the Fed is set to cut rates in just under two weeks, Powell's speech will likely be parsed for clues on whether the central bank is leaning more dovish in the run-up to the Fed meeting on Sept. 17-18.
According to Investing.com’s Fed Rate Monitor Tool, there's a 94.5% chance the Fed cuts rates by a quarter point later this month."
566,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 06, 2019 05:12AM ET</span>",European stocks flat ahead of U.S. payrolls,"(Reuters) - European stocks opened flat on Friday after two sessions of gains, as the effect of this week's upbeat signals on U.S.-China trade talks and European politics wore off, with investors' attention turning to U.S. jobs data due later in the day.

Nissan and other Japanese firms have been a casualty of consumer boycotts of products ranging from cars to beer in South Korea, triggered by sudden export curbs by Tokyo earlier this year as trust between the two countries has eroded over wartime issues.
Citing unnamed sources, the FT said that besides stopping sales in South Korea, Nissan is also mulling its involvement in an assembly plant in Busan owned by  Renault  Samsung (KS:005930) Motors Co, a joint venture with Nissan's French automaking partner Renault SA (PA:RENA). The plant makes cars mainly for export markets.
Nissan spokespeople in South Korea and Japan declined to comment on the report.
Japan's second-biggest automaker has been trying to strengthen governance, slash costs and boost flagging profitability amid persistent allegations of financial misconduct stemming from former chairman Carlos Ghosn's 20-year reign.
Nissan's market share in South Korea has long lagged its domestic rivals. Along with its luxury Infiniti brand, the automaker has sold just 3,581 cars in the country in January-August this year, down 27% from a year ago and trailing far behind Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203).
Japanese automakers are small players in the South Korean auto market, which is dominated by  Hyundai Motor  Co (KS:005380), and German imports including the Mercedes Benz and BMW (DE:BMWG) brands."

569,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 06, 2019 03:26AM ET</span>",Inside drugmakers' strategy to boost cancer medicines with 'Lazarus effect',"By Julie Steenhuysen and Ludwig Burger
(Reuters) - In the halls of MD Anderson Cancer Center, the drug Vitrakvi is known for having a ""Lazarus effect"" in some patients because it can reverse late-stage cancer that has defied all other treatment options.
Developed by Eli Lilly and Co's (N:LLY) Loxo Oncology and marketed by German drugmaker Bayer (DE:BAYGn), it fights a rare genetic mutation that appears in less than 1% of solid tumors, regardless of where they appear in the body.
Finding those patients will require widespread adoption of sophisticated tests that look for multiple genetic alterations that could be driving the cancer.
So far, progress has been slow.
Adoption of so-called next-generation sequencing (NGS) tests has been stalled by lack of reimbursement from insurers over concerns that the evidence is not there yet to support widescale use, according to more than a dozen interviews with oncologists and pharmaceutical and diagnostic industry executives.
As a result, pharma companies from small biotech  Blueprint Medicines Corp  (O:BPMC) to larger rivals Lilly and Roche Holding AG (S:ROG) are taking matters into their own hands, bulking up staff to increase patient and physician awareness about testing and building up a gene testing infrastructure that for many community hospitals still does not exist.
Bayer executives told Reuters it plans to spend $70 million to increase patient and physician awareness of testing for rare mutations and to encourage regulatory approval of more tests. They expect that budget to expand as Vitrakvi continues to win approval in other countries.
Lilly told Reuters the company has signed an agreement with Thermo Fisher Scientific (N:TMO) to develop a companion diagnostic test for its experimental drug, LOXO-292.
The deal adds RET mutations - the target of both Lilly's and Blueprint's drugs - to Thermo's Oncomine Dx  Target  (NYSE:TGT) Test, which local pathology labs can use to identify multiple genes linked with non-small cell lung cancer.
The agreement is aimed to help identify more lung and thyroid cancer patients who may benefit from the Lilly or Blueprint therapies. The Thermo test is already approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration - a key standard for Medicare coverage, the companies said.
According to Dr. Brian Alexander, chief medical officer of Roche's gene testing company Foundation Medicine, only about 15% of U.S. patients with advanced cancers get comprehensive genomic profiling. Another 25% get single-gene testing, he said, and a large proportion ""are not getting any testing at all.""
At MD Anderson, which sees 100,000 new cancer patients a year, only around 10,000 eventually have their tumors sequenced.
For a rare few, the tests are lifesaving.
Xin Zheng, 47, a mother of three in Michigan who was referred to Reuters by Blueprint, was diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer in 2016. After failing several treatments, she was out of options.
Her husband, Zhigang Wei, asked for genetic sequencing, and the test turned up a RET mutation. After contacting multiple lung cancer experts, Zhigang found an early-stage clinical trial treating patients with Blueprint's experimental drug, BLU-677.
Now, Xin is nearly back to normal.
“My wife is lucky,"" he said, adding her quality of life is much better and she has hope for the future.
Finding patients with such rare mutations is like ""looking for the needle in the haystack,"" said Stefan Oelrich, head of pharmaceuticals at Bayer.
Dr. David Hyman of Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, who tested Vitrakvi in clinical trials, said making these tests the norm for advanced cancer patients will require a huge shift in the way oncology is practiced.
""It's painful to know there are patients out there with these alterations who are dying without knowing about it and without getting any treatments,"" he said.
NOT GETTING TESTED
For Bayer's Vitrakvi and Roche's Rozlytrek, along with similar drugs in development, genomic testing is critical to finding patients who can benefit from them.
Cancer patients and drug companies alike got a boost last year when the federal Medicare health program for the elderly and disabled said it would cover FDA-approved tests for advanced cancer patients that can identify hundreds of genetic mutations at once. A Medicare endorsement is generally followed by widespread coverage decisions by private insurers.
But the final regulations dropped a requirement that testmakers prove the tests are cost-effective and improve patient care. That created an ""evidence gap"" that has allowed some insurers, also known as third-party payers, to withhold coverage or demand more proof that they benefit patients, said Jeff Schreier of  Diaceutics  PLC (L:DXRX), a data analytics company that works with drugmakers to improve diagnostic testing.
""More payers are coming around, but it's slow,"" he said.
The most recent coverage policy from CVS Health Corp's (N:CVS) Aetna approves many single-gene tests for specific cancers, but still largely considers multi-gene tests experimental. Anthem Inc's (N:ANTM) policy limits testing to ""medically necessary"" use and states there's ""insufficient published evidence"" to support widespread testing.
And while Foundation Medicine's and Thermo Fisher's tests are getting reimbursed from Medicare, many hospitals such as MD Anderson, which have developed their own tests, are not guaranteed payment. ""Reimbursement is still a driving force,"" MD Anderson's Kenna Shaw said of genomic testing, which costs an average of $5,000 per patient globally.
Lilly bought Loxo in January for $8 billion to profit from its targeted drugs in early-stage development. Bayer secured the rights to Loxo's two leading compounds in a 2017 alliance.
Dr. Anthony Sireci, Loxo's senior medical director, said the company has been working to ""democratize"" testing in the United States by increasing its use in local pathology labs, where most cancer testing has traditionally been done. The Thermo Fisher agreement will support those goals and expand patients' access to ""high-quality genomic testing,"" he said.
""TEST YOUR CANCER""
Bayer has hired diagnostic experts to help its medical and sales staff assess the barriers to genomic testing and ensure that local pathology labs are including the genetic alterations targeted by its drugs when they profile tumors, the company's oncology strategic business chief Robert LaCaze said in an interview.
Bayer also launched a public awareness campaign called ""Test Your Cancer"" that urges patients to ask their doctors about genomic cancer testing. The company is working with testing providers to ensure test reports are easy to understand.
Blueprint, which has six genomically-targeted drugs in development, told Reuters it plans to hire six diagnostics experts to increase awareness of the mutations their drugs target, especially in community medical practices, where 70% of cancers are treated.
Bayer sees signs of progress. Based on internal data, the company estimates average sequencing rates across tumors neared 30% last year, and the company saw a two-fold increase in the number of labs offering tests that carry the mutation targeted by Vitrakvi.
Bayer has not released sales figures for Vitrakvi.
Asked for an update in the most recent earnings call in July, Bayer's Oelrich said uptake is going ""according to plan,"" but declined to say how many patients are using the drug. LaCaze said with very rare cancers like the ones Vitrakvi targets, sales growth is ""something that will build over time."""
570,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 06, 2019 03:05AM ET</span>",Exclusive: U.S. congressional probe finds possible lapses in Deutsche Bank controls - sources,"By Mark Hosenball, Matt Scuffham and John O'Donnell
LONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. congressional investigators have identified possible failures in  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) AG's (D:DBKGn) money laundering controls in its dealings with Russian oligarchs, after the lender handed over a trove of transaction records, emails and other documents, three people familiar with the matter said.
The congressional inquiry found instances where Deutsche Bank staff in the United States and elsewhere flagged concerns about new Russian clients and transactions involving existing ones, but were ignored by managers, two of the people said.
Lawmakers are also examining whether Deutsche Bank facilitated the funneling of illegal funds into the United States as a correspondent bank, where it processes transactions for others, one of the sources said.
The congressional probe, whose initial findings have not been previously reported, is at an early stage, and it is not yet clear whether it will lead to any action against the bank, the three sources said.
A Deutsche Bank spokesman, Troy Gravitt, said the bank cannot comment on the work of the congressional committees but remains committed to cooperating with authorized investigations.
Addressing past deficiencies in the bank's controls, the spokesman said: ""We have worked to address them, taken disciplinary measures with regards to certain individuals and reviewed our client onboarding and monitoring processes.""
The House of Representatives Financial Services Committee declined to comment. 
The Democrat-controlled House began examining possible money laundering in U.S. property deals involving President Donald Trump, a Republican, earlier this year. The lawmakers are also looking into whether Trump's dealings left him subject to the influence of foreign individuals or governments.
The White House and a Trump Organization spokeswoman, Amanda Miller, did not respond to requests for comment.
Deutsche Bank has been drawn into the inquiry as Trump's biggest lender and submitted documents to investigators in response to a subpoena.
The stakes are high for the German lender, which is trying to engineer a turnaround under Chief Executive Officer Christian Sewing after a multi-year bet on building a global investment banking business unraveled.
Graham Barrow, a financial crime consultant, said that while the bank had since sought to reform, it had taken too many risks in countries such as Russia.
""The bank decided to go for becoming a global investment bank,"" Barrow said. ""They were compromised.""
Deutsche Bank declined to comment on Barrow's view.
In 2017, Deutsche Bank agreed to pay regulators in the United States and Britain $630 million in fines for organizing $10 billion in sham trades that could have been used to launder money out of Russia. Two of the sources said that the preliminary findings of the congressional investigators may have some overlap with that case but also include lapses unrelated to that matter.
New evidence thrown up by the congressional probe could feed into further investigations by other authorities, regulatory experts said.
If evidence of wrongdoing is found, it could also harm the bank's efforts to strengthen its relationships with U.S. regulators and deter investors concerned about the possibility of future regulatory sanctions. Deutsche Bank's shares hit an all-time low last month.
CONGRESSIONAL SUBPOENA
Earlier this year, the House Financial Services Committee served a 12-page subpoena on Deutsche Bank. Reuters has seen a version with portions blacked out.
Lawmakers requested documents that identify ""any financial relationship, transactions, or ties"" between Trump, his family members and his companies and ""any foreign individual, entity, or government"", according to the subpoena.
It also asks for hundreds of documents relating to other bank clients, including Russian oligarchs, the three sources said. These documents include account applications, know-your-client money laundering checks, internal assessments of ""suspicious activity"", as well as information about loans and mortgages, according to the subpoena.
Although Trump has challenged the release of his banking records in court, in April Deutsche started handing over information that is not directly related to the president and is continuing to do so, one of the people said.
That includes material prepared by bank staff for filing so-called suspicious activity reports to the U.S. Treasury Department and documents about Russian deals circulated among the bank's management and reputational risk committee, one person said.
The bank has also assembled a large amount of the subpoenaed Trump material, pending the court's decision on whether it should be released, the three people said.

The House Financial Services Committee will continue its investigation of Deutsche Bank's money laundering processes regardless of whether the court rules the lender should hand over the Trump documents to investigators, three sources familiar with the investigation said.

572,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 06, 2019 02:11AM ET</span>","Russian exports to Turkey, southeast Europe squeezed by LNG, Azeri gas","By Ekaterina Kravtsova
LONDON (Reuters) - Russian gas exports to Turkey and eight other southeast European nations fell by more than a quarter in the first half of 2019 as cheaper liquefied natural gas (LNG) and new Azeri supplies helped the region reduce reliance on Russia.
Russian exports to Turkey, the biggest regional market, fell 36% compared to the first half of 2018, while exports to Greece and Bulgaria dropped 12.7% and 17.4% respectively, data published by Russia's Gazprom (MM:GAZP) showed.
Low LNG prices, driven down by sluggish spot demand in Asia and rising output particularly in the United States, as well as the expansion of gas output and pipeline capacity from Azerbaijan, helped some regional nations diversify suppliers.
Gazprom's exports to the nine regional states fell 27% to 14.2 billion cubic meters (bcm) from 19.5 bcm a year earlier, the figures published by the Russian energy giant showed.
""Low LNG prices are accelerating the trend of reducing Russian gas dependency,"" said Alex Lagakos, head of Greek Energy Forum, a think-tank focusing on Greece and regional markets.
Dutch front-month contract, a benchmark for spot LNG delivered to Europe, averaged at $3.6 per million British thermal units (mmBtu) this summer, about half Gazprom's price for gas supplied to Turkey, a Turkish gas market source said. Gazprom does not publish its gas contract prices.
Turkey imported 8.1 bcm from Gazprom in the first half of this year, down from 12.7 bcm a year earlier. Its reliance on Russian supplies fell to 35% of its needs from 49%.
A Turkish gas market source said the drop in Russian flows might have been intended ""to show Gazprom that Turkey can survive without Russian gas.""
But analysts said regional countries were not seeking to squeeze out Gazprom completely in favor of LNG, rather they wanted to reduce their heavy dependence on a single supplier.
Gulmira Rzayeva, a research associate at the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies, said the region's aim was ""to become more energy secure.""
Turkey's gas imports from Iran held almost steady, while imports from Azerbaijan surged 43% in the period, after the launch of the second stage of BP's (L:BP) Shah Deniz gas field in the Caspian Sea and the Trans-Anatolian Natural Gas Pipeline (TANAP) run by Azerbaijan's SOCAR last year, data from Turkey's energy market authority EDPK showed.
Market share of Turkey's gas suppliers - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/12/5665/5615/Turkey%20gas%20market%20share.jpg
CONTRACT TERMS
Turkish private companies that have deals with Gazprom to import 10 bcm a year have imported only 600 million cubic meters in the first six months, the source said, blaming high prices.
Another industry source said buyers were typically required to take 80% to 85% of the contracted amount or pay a fee.
Their failure to secure a price reduction in the Gazprom contracts might mean they could be reluctant to extend the deals when they expire in the early 2020s, industry experts said.
Rzayeva said one factor pushing Botas to reduce its reliance on Gazprom was the strict terms in the Russian firm's contracts that prevented gas being sold on to other buyers, a requirement limiting the Turkish state energy firm's bid to turn Turkey into a regional gas hub.
""The Russian contract has a destination clause, the Azeri deals from Shah Deniz stages 1 and 2 don't,"" she said.
Turkey's LNG imports rose 12% in the first six months to 4.92 million tonnes, equivalent to about 6.7 bcm, Refinitiv Eikon data showed. Spot LNG imports outpaced the rise in Turkish purchases via long-term contracts with Algeria and Nigeria.
Turkey's gas imports - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/12/5660/5610/Turkey's%20gas%20imports.jpg
LNG SHARE
Greece, which imported 1.5 bcm from Gazprom in the first six months of 2019 compared to 1.7 bcm a year earlier, reported an even bigger 156% jump in LNG imports to 0.82 million tonnes, equivalent to about 1.1 bcm, according to Refinitiv Eikon data.
Gazprom's share of the Greek market also slipped to 50% from 60%, a Greek market industry source said, while the share of LNG rose to 40% from about 30%, Greek Energy Forum's Lagakos said.
""This is one of the highest shares in Europe (for LNG), only comparable to the ones of the Iberian market,"" he said.
Greece's Public Gas Company (DEPA) has been discussing a long-term LNG supply deal with U.S. supplier Cheniere and has reserved 1 bcm a year via the Trans Adriatic Pipeline (TAP), a link that extends to Italy and which is due to start in 2020.
Bulgaria, which until this year had been almost entirely dependent on Russian gas, has purchased two shipments of LNG from the United States. The LNG imports come via Greece as Bulgaria does not have a regassification terminal.
Bulgaria also signed a contract in April with DEPA for another gas shipment.
Construction of a pipeline to Bulgaria via Greece to import Azeri gas also began this year. Sofia plans to meet up to 30% of its gas needs beyond 2020 under a contract to import 1 bcm a year from Azerbaijan's Shah Deniz 2 field.
Ankara is also in talks with Sofia to supply any extra gas it receives from Azerbaijan to Bulgaria, Rzayeva said.
Bulgaria's state energy firm Bulgargaz and Botas did not respond to Reuters requests for comment.
Gazprom aims to beef up its network to supply the region and beyond. It is aiming to launch the TurkStream pipeline across the Black Sea to Turkey in coming months with capacity of 15.75 bcm a year in its first stage. The pipeline will be used to transport some gas to Europe that now transits Ukraine.
Gazprom said the recent drop in exports to Turkey and other regional countries would not affect the long-term Turkstream plans. ""It is not correct to make a conclusion about demand for it from a one-time market situation,"" it said when asked.
Gazprom also told Reuters it was confident it would remain a major supplier to Europe, saying it ""does not see any threat to its positions in Europe as gas demand in the region will remain consistently high."""
573,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 06, 2019 01:52AM ET</span>",No place like home: Chinese firms stung by trade war build up domestic brands,"By Pei Li and Brenda Goh
SHENZHEN, China/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - For over a decade, manufacturer Matsutek plied away at building its business with big Western brands, supplying firms such as Philips (AS:PHG) and Honeywell (N:HON) with products made in its Chinese factories for the U.S. and other overseas markets.
That strategy paid off, helping it grow into the world's second-largest maker of robotic vacuum cleaners. But then, the Taipei-headquartered firm became one of the many corporate casualties in the escalating trade war between Washington and Beijing.
Sales of Masutek's products in the United States plunged by a fifth last year in the wake of 25% tariffs on Chinese goods, forcing it to shut down two of its 11 assembly lines - all located in mainland China.
Already disenchanted with the U.S. market after a legal battle with rival  iRobot Corp  (O:IRBT) in 2017, the tariffs were the last straw and in December Matsutek switched its focus to its own ""Jiaweishi"" vacuum cleaners - promoting them on Alibaba's (N:BABA) Tmall and Pinduoduo's (O:PDD) e-commerce platforms.
Although the brand was created in 2015, Matsutek had until then not done much with it.
""This was our wake-up moment. We realized we couldn't rely on overseas markets alone, rather we should build our own brands in China,"" Terry Wu, general manager of two Matsutek units in Shenzhen, told Reuters.
The trade war is proving to be a turning point for the countless Chinese original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) that supply products to Western firms to rebrand and sell, and on whose backs China has built up its reputation as the ""Factory of the World"".
For some like Matsutek, it has triggered a major strategic rethink, while for others that have been developing brands aimed at the Chinese consumer, it has prompted them to step up those efforts. 
""Being an OEM is like being a peasant counting on a good year of rain. Why shouldn't we build our own brands, lower the price a bit and offer products that have the same quality as foreign brands,"" Wu said.
Indeed, for China-based companies heavily exposed to the U.S. market, it is one of their few strategic options aside from shifting some production to other countries - a tactic that is also gaining momentum.
Longer term, the greater impetus for Chinese companies to more aggressively develop their own brands is expected to spell fiercer competition for big foreign companies.
""Chinese companies that used to be business partners and suppliers are becoming rivals,"" said Jason Ding, partner at consultancy Bain & Company, adding that foreign brands in the Chinese market will have to step up their game.
E-COMMERCE PUSH
Anhui Deli, a maker of wine glasses and other glassware with annual revenue of 800 million yuan ($113 million), has also been hit hard by the trade tariffs.
""The U.S. was our main growth market until this year but due to the trade war, clients have become hesitant to put in an order, and many orders from the U.S. have been canceled,"" said Cheng Yingling, the company's marketing director.
Additional tariffs that went into effect this month will bring the levies on Chinese glassware to 40% - a big hit to the industry, he added.
E-commerce sales at home, however, have helped offset some of that pain. Recently teaming up with  Pinduoduo , sales of a new glass container have hit more than 50,000 a month - around three times more than what a similar product would sell through stores.
It has also decided to open a factory in Pakistan, which is expected to start operating in January. But transferring output to other countries takes time and can be fraught with risks.
Both Matsutek, a smaller firm that made 500 million yuan in revenue last year, and Shenzhen MTC Co, a supplier of TVs to Walmart Inc (N:WMT) under the Onn brand with 13 billion yuan in annual revenue, spent months exploring a shift of some production to Vietnam.
But they gave up after U.S. President Donald Trump's administration threatened in June to add the Southeast Asian country to its tariff list.
MTC, which bought the rights to the JVC brand in China in 2017, has also started to work with Pinduoduo. 
Prompted in part by the trade dispute, the e-commerce firm is wooing companies which want to quickly expand in the domestic market with a program launched in December that provides consulting services on product development. It also promises to share data and provide ad time.
""Pinduoduo reached out to us and said they want to have a manufacturer-to-consumer business model. Considering they are doing very well in lower tier cities and have fewer partners in home appliances (than other e-commerce firms) we decided to work with them,"" said David Fang, vice president of MTC.
Matsutek's Wu said the firm's new focus on the China market has been a huge success, and it has sold more than 100,000 robotic vacuum cleaners under the Jiaweishi brand. It plans to reopen the two assembly lines it shut down and add three more by early next year.
""We think there are great opportunities in China. The penetration rate of robotic vacuum cleaners in the U.S. market is 17%, while in China it's only 1.5%,"" said Wu.
""At the end of the day, there are more than 1 billion people here.""

The deal hands Alibaba the biggest Chinese online marketplace for foreign brands after its own Tmall Import and Export. Kaola will now operate independently but with a new chief executive officer, Alvin Liu, appointed from Tmall. Separately, Alibaba and Jack Ma’s Yunfeng Capital will pour $700 million into NetEase Cloud Music, the companies said in a statement. NetEase will remain the controlling shareholder of its music app.
Both companies compete against social media titan Tencent Holdings Ltd. across several fronts. For Alibaba, the emergence of Tencent-backed rivals like Pinduoduo Inc. is testing its longstanding dominance of Chinese online retail. While NetEase has long been the closest rival to Tencent in gaming, it has also expanded into music streaming -- another area where Tencent leads. Alibaba has its own music app Xiami.
What Bloomberg Intelligence says
Alibaba’s $2 billion acquisition of Kaola, NetEase’s cross-border e-commerce platform, will make it the go-to channel for Chinese consumers seeking high-quality foreign products.
-- Vey-Sern Ling and Tiffany Tam, analysts-- Click here for the research
For NetEase, selling its low-margin Kaola platform would allow the company to focus on its bread-and-butter gaming business.
The Kaola deal will make Alibaba the “go-to” venue for consumers seeking imported goods, Bloomberg Intelligence analysts Vey-Sern Ling and Tiffany Tam wrote in a note Friday. Together, Alibaba and Kaola controlled almost 60% of all transactions on China-based platforms for foreign brands in the second quarter, according to research firm Analysys.
NetEase Music most recently raised $600 million in November when Baidu Inc (NASDAQ:BIDU)., General Atlantic and Boyu Capital participated. Its latest capital injection comes after China’s antitrust authority launched a probe into its much larger rival, Tencent Music Entertainment Group, over its content relicensing practices.

The Securities and Exchange Board of India has asked for a forensic audit of the company’s financial statements for three fiscal years to March 2018, India’s biggest drugmaker told exchanges in a late evening filing Thursday without specifying the reason. The shares fell 3% to 439.35 rupees at 9:23 a.m. in Mumbai.
The latest probe points to mounting challenges for the billionaire Dilip Shanghvi-controlled drugmaker after whistle-blower complaints on corporate governance lapses triggered a stock slide last year and forced the firm to tweak some of its business contracts to contain the crisis. The latest regulatory action was disclosed after a query by exchanges asking the company to confirm local news reports that Sun had been asked to conduct the forensic audit following the complaints.
“Sentimentally things will remain negative at the present juncture,” said Surya Patra, vice president at Phillipcapital India Pvt. in Mumbai. “What is not known is the outcome of the investigation, and if there will be some action taken by Sebi. The basis of the forensic audit is also not known.”
Sun Pharma had swung into action early this year to quell the crisis of confidence, triggered by the whistle-blower complaints alleging that its founder Shanghvi was wringing extra financial benefits from the company’s operations through related party transactions.
Shanghvi had denied wrongdoing in a December conference call.
The company is “committed to adhering to all applicable legal and statutory requirements,” it said in the filing on Thursday."

Shares in Tokyo, Seoul and Sydney saw modest gains, with the MSCI Asia Pacific Index on course for its biggest weekly advance since June. The S&P 500 closed more than 1% higher as trade hostilities appeared to ease between the U.S. and China, and strong private payrolls data and a better-than-expected reading on the services sector tamped down recession angst. Treasury yields held on to a jump that came amid a deluge of investment-grade corporate supply. Australian bonds tracked Thursday’s sell-off. The dollar was little changed.
News that top Chinese and American officials agreed to restart talks aimed at ending the trade war is helping boost sentiment and adds to a renewed appetite for risk assets that took hold earlier in the week. After the strong U.S. economic data, focus is now likely to shift to remarks from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell and the latest jobs report, both due Friday.
“While this has been some positive economic data, it makes it a little more difficult for the Fed to cut rates,” Kristina Hooper, chief global market strategist at Invesco Ltd., told Bloomberg TV. “I suspect what we will hear from Powell is a very tepid commentary on the Fed’s ability to provide monetary policy accommodation.”
Elsewhere, Florida orange groves seemingly escaped major damage from Hurricane Dorian, but concern is now turning to soy, corn and cotton fields as well as livestock in Georgia and the Carolinas as the storm churns northward.

581,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 05, 2019 10:10PM ET</span>","Trump to meet with USDA, EPA officials about biofuels plan: sources","By Chris Prentice and Stephanie Kelly
(Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump is expected to meet with Department of Agriculture and Environmental Protection Agency officials late Thursday to consider a plan that would include boosting biofuels requirements for 2020 by 1 billion gallons, according to two sources familiar with the discussions.
Trump has promised to deliver a ""giant package"" to U.S. farmers related to ethanol, in response to ire from U.S. farmers and biofuels advocates over a large number of exemptions regulators have given to oil refineries to free them of requirements to blend biofuels.
The Renewable Fuel Standard, signed into law by President George W. Bush in 2005, requires refineries to blend increasing volumes of biofuels into their fuel each year. Small facilities under financial strain can be exempted, and Trump authorized the EPA to grant 31 waivers to small refineries in August, far more than the Obama administration had typically granted.
The draft plan under consideration would include a previously discussed increase of 500 million gallons for conventional biofuels, largely corn-based ethanol, as well as an additional 500 million gallons for advanced biofuels like biodiesel for 2020. It would also include an addition to the biodiesel mandate for 2021 of 250 million gallons.
That increase would help address ""excess waivers,"" which have also harmed biodiesel and soy farmers, the document said. 
An EPA spokesperson declined to confirm or comment on the plan but said the agency will continue to consult on the best path forward for the program.
""The president will always seek to engage with stakeholders to achieve wins for the agriculture and energy sectors,"" the spokesperson said.
EPA in July proposed setting biofuels requirements at 20.04 billion gallons in 2020, up from 19.92 billion gallons in 2019. That included 15 billion gallons of conventional biofuels like ethanol. The EPA also proposed setting the 2021 biodiesel volume at 2.43 billion gallons, unchanged from 2020.
Further details about Thursday's meeting and the latest proposal were unclear but had already drawn criticism from the oil industry.
""Pursuing this plan jeopardizes the refining industry’s support of the president and would undoubtedly raise fuel prices for consumers, neither of which would be good for the president going into next year’s election,"" said Chet Thompson, head of the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers.
Backlash to the waivers has been particularly strong in Iowa, the largest producer of corn and ethanol, and a swing state won twice by former Democrat President Barack Obama but which voted for Trump in 2016.
""The EPA’s exemptions have destroyed demand for far more than a billion gallons each year,"" said Brooke Coleman of the Advanced Biofuels Business Council. ""Farm-state champions are looking for a fix that will put the RFS back on the track that Congress intended.”

Spurred by a number of positive drivers, the MSCI AC Asia Pacific was poised to hit its largest one-week gain since June and was up 0.17% early in the morning. 
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index continued to rally for the third day in a row. The city's benchmark index was up 0.60% to 26,658 at the opening as of 9:33 PM ET (01:30 GMT). The worst performing major stock market in the world in August, Hong Kong has surged more than 5% over the past two days after Chief Executive Carrie Lam said she would formally withdraw a controversial extradition bill that has sparked 14 weeks of often violent protests and widespread social unrest.

583,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 05, 2019 09:52PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Petrobras unit head removed amid bribery allegations,"By Gram Slattery and Ricardo Brito
RIO DE JANEIRO/BRASILIA (Reuters) - The chief executive of a natural gas pipeline unit of Brazilian state oil firm Petrobras (SA:PETR4) has been removed, the company told Reuters on Thursday, after a middleman in a graft scheme implicated him in plea bargain testimony.
Transportadora Brasileira Gasoduto Bolívia-Brasil (TBG), which operates a 1,610-mile pipeline transporting natural gas from Bolivia to Brazil, said its board approved the removal of Ivan de Sá on Wednesday at the request of Petrobras, its majority shareholder.
TBG did not state the reason for his removal, nor offer any further details.
Reuters had asked TBG and parent firm Petrobras on Tuesday about the previously unreported plea bargain testimony. In the testimony, reviewed by Reuters, a middleman said that Sá helped coordinate a scheme in which Petrobras employees purportedly accepted bribes from commodity trading firm Vitol in return for cut-price oil contracts. 
On Wednesday, Sá denied the allegations in a statement sent through TBG's press office.
""Mr. Ivan de Sá received with confusion and indignation the information that his name had been mentioned in plea bargain testimony, TBG said. The allegations ""do not rise above mere insinuation, speculative in character, without any basis in fact or proof.""
Sá is one of the highest-profile executives at Petrobras hit by graft allegations since President Jair Bolsonaro took office in January, pledging a break with years of corruption. Scores of politicians, business leaders and even Petrobras CEOs have been charged with bribery schemes over the past five years.
Sá took the helm at TBG in May, according to his LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) profile. Until April, he was chief executive of fuel distributor  Petrobras Distribuidora  SA (SA:BRDT3), which was privatized in July. He was previously a manager in Petrobras' trading unit.
Petrobras said it had immediately begun internal inquiries after learning about the plea bargain testimony and had removed employees named in the testimony from their positions. It added that it was not pre-judging employees and that the allegations did not yet appear to be backed by material evidence.
Petrobras Distribuidora said in a statement that the events described in the testimony ""had no relation to the firm.""
JAIL YARD CONVERSATION
According to the documents seen by Reuters, which summarize a plea deal reached in August with federal prosecutors, oil industry veteran Carlos Henrique Nogueira Herz testified he had helped funnel bribes to Petrobras employees in return for sweetheart fuel trades with trading firms Vitol and Trafigura from 2011 to 2014.
Herz also testified that Sá had helped to manage a scheme in which employees in Petrobras' trading unit manipulated an algorithm determining when and where to buy oil. He said the manipulation made Petroleo Brasileiro SA (SA:PETR4), as Petrobras is formally known, buy Vitol oil at inflated prices.
Herz said he did not have direct knowledge of the specific scheme. The testimony does not make clear when it supposedly took place. Herz said Carlos Roberto Martins Barbosa, at one point a high-ranking Petrobras trading manager, told him of Sá's role during a jail yard conversation.
The two were detained together in December 2018 and January 2019, according to the court documents, after both men were charged over allegations they belonged to a criminal group funneling bribes to Petrobras employees.
Herz provided dozens of pages of e-mails and bank statements detailing the bribery scheme as a whole, though none of the e-mails and bank statements reviewed by Reuters referenced Sá. 
In a statement, Vitol said it would not be appropriate to comment on Herz's testimony ""beyond reiterating our zero tolerance policy in respect of bribery and corruption"" and cooperating fully with authorities.
Trafigura said in a statement that it was aware of reports of Herz's testimony but had not been contacted by Brazilian authorities in relation to the allegations.
""Any suggestion that Trafigura's current management knew that its payments would be used to make improper payments to employees of Petrobras is not correct,"" the statement said. ""Trafigura has a zero tolerance policy on bribery and corruption."" 
A law office representing the former trading manager Barbosa did not answer phone calls or a message sent to an e-mail address listed on registration documents.
A lawyer for Herz did not respond to requests for comment on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and LinkedIn. The lawyer's offices did not pick up phone calls. Prosecutors did not respond to a request for comment. 
The oil trading investigation became public knowledge in December when prosecutors said that Vitol, Trafigura,  Glencore  (L:GLEN) and Mercuria Energy Group used intermediaries to pay at least $31 million in bribes to Petrobras employees. In return, the Petrobras employees sold them oil at below-market rates and offered privileged information that gave them an edge over competitors when trading with the oil firm, prosecutors said.

The companies, which together control about 10 percent of the world's daily oil consumption, have said they are cooperating with the Brazilian investigation.

584,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 05, 2019 08:26PM ET</span>",Facebook launches dating service in United States,"By Katie Paul
(Reuters) -  Facebook Inc  (O:FB) is launching its dating services in the United States, the social network said on Thursday, sending its shares up 2%.
The company said users will be able to integrate their Instagram accounts with Facebook's dating profile and add Instagram followers to their ""Secret Crush"" lists. That feature allows users to indicate romantic interest in a friend, without the attraction becoming public. If two friends each tag the other as a crush, Facebook Dating alerts both of the interest.
The service would be optional for Facebook and Instagram users, the company said, adding that dating activity of users will not appear on their profile or news feed.
The service will be available only to users aged 18 and over, who can decide who gets to see their dating profile, Facebook said.
The launch marks a major expansion of Facebook's dating service, initially rolled out in Colombia, Thailand, Canada, Argentina and Mexico last year.
It also opens the company to further scrutiny of its privacy and safety record, which has caught the attention of regulators around the world after years of scandals over its handling of personal information.
Facebook offers safety guidelines to people who sign up for a Dating profile and notes in the liability section of its terms of service that it does not conduct background checks or sex offender register searches.
""You interact with other users at your own risk,"" the terms state.
Fidji Simo, who recently took over leadership of the core Facebook app, said at the company's annual F8 developer conference in May that the service was expanding into 14 new countries in Asia and Latin America and would be available in the United States by the end of the year.
She also introduced the new Secret Crush feature, which allows users to express romantic interest in nine of their Facebook friends or Instagram followers. Dating profiles are separate from those other services, but use their data to identify Secret Crush matches.
The expansion poses a threat to competitor dating apps, which have long similarly relied on data from connected Facebook accounts to identify possible connections between users.
Facebook, with its 2.1 billion daily active users, dwarfs the scale of those apps. CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in 2018 that 200 million Facebook users listed themselves as single.
Leading competitor Match Group (O:MTCH), which operates Tinder, OkCupid, Plenty of Fish and other dating apps in 190 countries, has about 50 million daily users, according to a Refinitiv estimate.
Shares of Match Group were down nearly 6% on the news. Match's parent IAC (O:IAC) was down more than 3%.
Facebook expects to launch the dating service in Europe by early 2020, in addition to the 20 countries where it is presently available."

586,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 05, 2019 07:06PM ET</span>","Explainer: U.S., China more divided than ever as new trade talks loom","By Andrea Shalal
(Reuters) - Senior U.S. and Chinese officials have pledged to meet in October to settle their ongoing trade war but a lasting peace seems more elusive than ever.
Since trade negotiations between the world's largest economies broke down in May, both countries have added tariffs on billions of dollars of the others' goods, broken good faith promises and traded public insults.
Washington accused Beijing of reneging on commitments to change its laws to enact economic reforms, while Beijing called U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff's ""barbaric."" Leaders from both countries are now vowing a long fight, despite slowing domestic economies.
Here is the state of play:
MEETING AMID BROKEN PROMISES
Deputies from the U.S. and China trade teams will talk in mid-September to prepare for negotiations between U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, and China's Vice Premier Liu He in early October. Both sides agreed to take actions to create favorable conditions, but gave no details.
Neither side has signaled it would shift from positions that led to the impasse in May, when Beijing revised a draft of the trade deal, removing references to changes in Chinese law.
U.S. officials have previously said that the resumption of talks would depend on China returning to the original May deal text, but there has been no sign that China has agreed to take that step.
Beijing has cited three main sticking points in the trade negotiations. They are the removal of tariffs imposed in the trade war, reduction of the scale of U.S. goods purchases that China will make to help reduce the trade imbalance between the two, and the need for a ""balanced"" text for any trade deal.
When Chinese President Xi Jinping and Trump met in Osaka, Japan in June, Beijing committed to buying 20 million tonnes of U.S. soybeans, but has only purchased half that amount since. Washington pledged to ease restrictions on blacklisted Huawei Technologies Co Ltd [HWT.UL], but has not issued waivers.
HUAWEI AND HONG KONG
Beijing is smarting from Trump's decision to blacklist Huawei, the world's largest telecommunications equipment maker, which effectively banned U.S. firms from doing business with the company. It has prompted many non U.S.-based companies to cut their own ties to the firm.
China wants the United States to lift those restrictions, trade deal or no, but Washington is lobbying other countries to reduce dealings with Huawei, and has threatened to blacklist other Chinese firms.
Trump's comments Aug. 14 linking successful trade talks with Beijing's ""humane"" handling of protests in Hong Kong could also fuel tensions between the two sides, particularly if the demonstrations heat up further.
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER
Before the talks broke down in May, U.S. officials had said the two side made progress on intellectual property protection and that China made proposals on a range of issues that went further than Beijing had gone before.
China for the first time discussed forced technology transfer as a widespread problem, U.S. officials said then. U.S. companies complain they are pressured to hand over their competitive secrets as a condition for doing business in China.
U.S. officials cited progress on cyber theft, services, currency, agriculture and non-tariff barriers to trade.
China, they said, offered to bring subsidies in line with World Trade Organization guidelines but had not detailed how it would do that.
For its part, the United States weakened demands China end industrial subsidies, which would require a change in China's state-driven economic model.
But after the deal fell apart, Lighthizer told a congressional hearing that China had also backtracked on commitments on digital trade issues, including U.S. access to cloud computing services in China.
U.S. officials said China offered to make purchases of over $1 trillion worth of goods over the next six years, including agricultural and energy products as well as industrial goods. China has said, however, that there is still disagreement between the two sides on the actual purchases.
TARIFFS AS A NEGOTIATING TOOL
One of the key sticking points before talks broke down in May was whether the Trump administration would remove 25% tariffs it had imposed on $250 billion worth of imported goods from China. The United States wanted to keep some tariffs in place to ensure that China met the terms of the deal, but China demanded all tariffs be lifted immediately.
Things have escalated since. Those U.S. tariffs are now due to rise to 30% from Oct. 1, the 70th anniversary of the current Chinese state. Another $300 billion of Chinese imports face 15% U.S. tariffs, some of which began Sept. 1, with the rest to start Dec. 15.
Washington could agree, as a sign of goodwill toward Beijing, to delay the 5% tariff increase, and possibly the 15% tariffs due to begin in December, analysts say.
China, which slapped 5% tariffs on U.S. crude oil Sept. 1, could postpone additional tariffs due Dec. 15. Those include a 25% tariff on U.S.-made vehicles and a 5% tariff on auto parts that it had suspended last December.
STOKING TRADE WAR FIRES AT HOME
Trump has repeatedly insisted that China is paying the cost of U.S. tariffs, a claim rejected by U.S. retailers and manufacturers, although he has recently begun to concede that the trade war could also harm the U.S. economy in the short-term.
""China has been ripping this country off for 25 years, for longer than that and it's about time whether it's good for our country or bad for our country short term. Long term it's imperative that somebody does this,"" he said in August.
China's Liu, also the chief trade negotiator, on Thursday also spoke about downward pressure on the Chinese economy, but said Beijing had sufficient policy tools to deal with any difficulties.
Many of China's analysts believe Beijing will roll out more measures to boost the economy, minimizing the impact of the trade war.
UNUSED WEAPONS
China has said it would draft its own list of foreign companies that it deems had harmed Chinese companies. That could serve as the basis for retaliation against U.S. companies for action against Huawei.
China has also indicated it may strike back through limiting rare earth supplies to the United States. Rare earth are minerals important to manufacturers of high-tech consumer goods and China is the dominant supplier.
It could also revoke orders for airplanes built by  Boeing Co  (N:BA), the No. 1 U.S. exporter.
Trump is calling for U.S. companies like General Motors Co (N:GM) to pull manufacturing facilities out of China.
THE BACKDROP
China is determined to upgrade its industrial base in 10 strategic sectors by 2025, including aerospace, robotics, semiconductors, artificial intelligence and new-energy vehicles.
One of the biggest U.S. complaints is that China has used coercion and outright theft to systematically obtain American intellectual property and trade secrets and advance its standing in many high-technology industries. China's subsidies to state enterprises, including at the provincial and local government levels, have led to a build up in Chinese industries like steel that has depressed global prices and hurt producers in the United States and elsewhere.
U.S. officials argue that makes it hard for U.S. companies to compete on a market-driven basis.
They say they do not have a problem with China moving up the technology ladder, but they do not want it to happen with stolen or unfairly obtained American know-how or in a market in which Chinese firms have an unfair advantage.
Chinese officials generally view the U.S. actions as a broad effort to thwart the Asian country's rise in the global economy. They previously denied China required or coerced technology transfers, saying that any such actions are commercial transactions between American and Chinese firms.
The Trump administration has aggressively stepped up prosecutions of intellectual property cases, and scaled back visas for Chinese students and researchers. U.S. lawmakers are writing bills that further limit visas, banning students with ties to the Chinese military.
Chinese authorities reject such accusations. In June Beijing warned students and academics about risks in the United States, pointing to limits on the duration of visas and visa refusals. It also warned companies operating in the United States they could face harassment from U.S. law enforcement, gun violence, robberies, and thefts."

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Three of Wall Street's top-performing IPO stocks in 2019 tumbled late on Thursday after the companies' quarterly results failed to satisfy investors and justify their high valuations.
 Zoom Video Communications  (O:ZM) dropped 2% in extended trade, even after the videoconferencing provider's quarterly results and full-year outlook beat analysts' expectations.
Cyber-security company Crowdstrike (O:CRWD) tumbled 8.7% after it reported better-than-expected results and gave upbeat quarterly guidance.
And business software seller Medallia (N:MDLA) tumbled 12.3% after its results also beat analysts' average expectations.
In a year marked by disappointing public listings by Uber Technologies (N:UBER) and  Lyft  (O:LYFT), the stock performances of Zoom, Medallia and Crowdstrike have stood out since their IPOs.
Prior to Thursday's after-hours declines, Zoom was up 157% from its initial public offering in April, Crowdstrike had risen 155% since it went public in June, and Medallia was up 74% from its IPO in July.
The sell-offs on Thursday, even after the money-losing companies beat consensus expectations, suggest investors may be becoming more concerned about high valuations.
""The strong print and weakness in the shares has been a recent pattern,"" Needham analyst Alex Henderson said.
""Investors are leery of this up-today, down-tomorrow market and seem to be selling into strength, and unwilling to let them ride, preferring to take profits,"" Henderson added.
Crowdstrike traded earlier on Thursday at about 85 times expected earnings for the next 12 months, while Medallia traded at a multiple of 37, according to Refinitiv data.
Zoom traded at 38 times expected revenue over the next 12 months. Analysts on average do not expect Zoom to report a non-GAAP profit until the quarter ending in October 2020.
Both Zoom's and Crowdstrike's year-over-year revenue growth decelerated from their first quarters as a public company. Zoom's sales growth slowed to 96% in the second quarter, from 103% in the first, while Crowdstrike's growth eased to 94%, from 103%.
Uber is down 28% since its May IPO, which had easily been this year's most highly anticipated. It is now widely viewed as the most disappointing, while Lyft has slumped 36% from its March IPO.

Slack Technologies Inc's (N:WORK) stock price more than doubled on its first day of trading in a direct listing on June 19, but has steadily fallen since then. On Friday, Slack closed just 15% above the reference price used in its listing.

PARIS/LONDON/HAMBURG (Reuters) - U.S. agribusiness firm  Bunge  Ltd (N:BG) laid off up to 10 grain traders in Geneva in recent days as it pursues a global restructuring to cut costs and reduce market exposure, five industry sources said.
The cuts to trading staff come as Bunge is streamlining its operations in tough agricultural markets and seeks to avoid a repeat of money-losing bets made early in the year-old U.S.-China trade war.
The exact number of jobs cut was unclear as the matter was confidential and the reorganization ongoing, the sources said. A sixth source said Bunge would unveil further details of its new organization on Sept. 16.
Bunge CEO Gregory Heckman, who took over in January, told Reuters in an interview last month that improving risk management at the 200-year-old company is a key focus as he oversees a portfolio review expected to last through the middle of 2020.
""It's mostly targeting risk-takers,"" one source said of the staff cuts in Geneva. ""It's about changing the organization towards one that breaks even and is more consistent, rather than making big bets.""
The group's Middle East grain desk was among sectors of the Geneva office targeted for staff cuts, other sources said.
The firm has already outlined a new global organization that will reduce the role of regional structures and last month said it would move its headquarters in the United States.
Bunge spokesman Frank Mantero declined to comment on staff cuts, saying ""discussions with employees are ongoing"".
The company is ""finalizing a new organizational set-up,"" adding to operating changes announced this year, Mantero said.
Like other multinational grain merchants, Bunge uses Geneva as an important hub to cover key markets in Europe, the Middle East and Africa.
Bunge has already scaled back its presence in the Swiss city after it sold its sugar trading business last year. It also shifted some support functions to Barcelona, sources said.
The latest cuts in Geneva also reflect streamlining linked to the planned headquarters move from White Plains, New York, to St. Louis, some of the sources said.
""This is a direct consequence of the decision to move the headquarters to St Louis,"" one said. ""It's unclear now what happens to the Geneva office."""
590,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 05, 2019 05:31PM ET</span>",U.S. audit regulator levied only $6.5 million in fines in 16 years: study,"By Katanga Johnson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A top U.S. accounting watchdog has brought only 18 enforcement actions and levied just $6.5 million in fines against the Big Four accounting firms in its 16-year existence, according to a study published on Thursday.
The report by the Project On Government Oversight (POGO) claims the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB), which oversees audit firms that are supposed to help keep publicly traded companies in check, is falling down on the job.
The report could increase pressure on the agency, which in recent years has been criticized for being too close to the industry it oversees and slow to ensure the industry performed its job.
The Washington-based group's analysis of 16 years' of PCAOB inspection reports on the U.S. arms of the Big Four audit firms - Deloitte & Touche, Ernst & Young, PricewaterhouseCoopers and KPMG - found the regulator identified 808 instances in which the firms issued defective audits.
But the agency has only brought 18 enforcement cases related to 21 audits against the Big Four. The Big Four audit 99% of companies in the S&P 500, according to POGO.
""The Project on Government Oversight chooses to focus only on our enforcement program, giving the impression that it is the sole means by which we fulfill our statutory mandate. This is incorrect,"" said PCAOB spokeswoman Torrie Matous in a statement
Created by the 2002 Sarbanes-Oxley Act as a private-sector nonprofit corporation, the PCAOB is tasked with policing the accounting firms that sign off on the books of the nation's listed companies. Sarbanes-Oxley aimed to tighten controls on the auditing industry following a string of accounting scandals, most notably the 2001 collapse of energy company Enron Corp.
Thursday's study comes after a long-anticipated shake-up at the regulator in January 2018 that led to the replacement of James Doty as the chairman and the appointment of four new board members. Unlike many other agency roles, the chairman of the PCAOB does not require confirmation by the Senate.
POGO's report did not provide any breakdown of enforcement actions taken when Doty was the chairman and after he was replaced.
According to the report, under its powers the agency could have fined the Big Four a minimum of $1.6 billion, but public records indicate fines of only $6.5 million.
""It's unacceptable that the agency is taking such a light-handed approach in holding these large audit firms accountable,"" said POGO's executive director, Danielle Brian. ""Exercising financial penalties against these firms might be the only way to get this industry on track. By failing to hold the Big Four accountable, the board is putting all Americans’ financial futures in jeopardy.""
The Securities and Exchange Commission oversees the PCAOB and also has the authority to inspect and fine auditors in breach of the rules. It has brought steep fines in the past.
Some industry advocates and former PCAOB board members say the regulator should not be held to the same standard as the SEC and that its primary function is not to bring enforcement actions but to help raise the quality of audits.
In its report, POGO cites Matous as saying that due to resource constraints the regulator is selective about the enforcement cases it pursues.
""All of our activities must be taken into account for a complete and accurate picture of the PCAOB’s work to hold audit firms accountable and drive improvement in audit quality,” Matous said on Thursday, adding that the agency's mission includes preventing, deterring and remediating audit deficiencies."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration wants to take Fannie and Freddie out of government conservatorship, but doing so will be complicated due to the central role they play in the housing market and the Treasury's holdings in the two firms.
Here's more detail on those arrangements:
WHAT ARE FANNIE MAE AND FREDDIE MAC?
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were created by Congress in 1938 and 1970, respectively, with a mandate to expand the U.S. housing market to help boost American homeownership. The pair buy home loans originated by banks, freeing up lenders' capital to make new loans. They then hold the mortgages or package them into securities to sell on the secondary market. The pair, which are private companies with government charters, currently guarantee over half of U.S. mortgages.
WHY DID THE GOVERNMENT TAKE OVER FANNIE AND FREDDIE?
In September 2008, the firms had mounting losses due to the subprime mortgage crisis. Fearing a meltdown in the U.S. housing market, the U.S. government took direct control of the companies by putting them into conservatorship under the Federal Housing Finance Agency. The Treasury also invested billions of dollars to prop them up and minimize damage to the housing market.
WHAT IS THE STATE OF PLAY NOW?
The firms have remained in conservatorship, with FHFA in control. The Treasury owns warrants representing nearly 80% of the common stock in the companies, as well as preferred shares. From 2012, the firms have given the Treasury all their profits and as of the first quarter of 2019, have paid the government $297 billion - well above the $191.5 billion in government funds they received, according to the companies' quarterly filings.
The companies also have legacy common and preferred equity securities that trade on the “pink sheets” market for unlisted entities. A number of hedge funds have built stakes in both classes of stock and some have sued the government over their 2008 seizure, claiming the private companies' profits have been illegally seized by the federal government.
WHAT HAS THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION DONE SO FAR?
In March, Trump ordered the Treasury and Housing and Urban Development Departments to develop a housing finance reform plan. That report published Sept. 5 lays out administrative and legislative recommendations for recapitalizing Fannie and Freddie and ending the conservatorship, promoting competition in the housing market, and protecting taxpayers from future bailouts.
Trump regulators have already taken some administrative steps to rein in Fannie and Freddie ahead of any potential overhaul. In July, they announced they would not extend an exemption, which will expire in 2021, that lets the pair back riskier mortgages - nearly one-fifth of their business, according to the Urban Institute.
And in August, the FHFA ordered the companies to cap CEO pay at $600,000.
Meanwhile, Senate Banking Committee Chairman Mike Crapo in February released a sketch for reforming the pair, but housing lobbyists do not expect material legislative action this Congress on such a contentious issue heading into the 2020 presidential election."

The business-focused messaging and communications platform's shares surged when it went public through a direct listing in June but have fallen steadily since and briefly touched the launch's original $26 reference price in morning trade.
Earlier in the day, the stock had fallen as much as 16% after the company forecast a much bigger-than-expected loss for the current quarter and said revenue growth would slow amid intensifying competition.
Two Wall Street brokerages cut their target price for the stock and, while there were no changes in recommendations, several said that expenses were taking a toll on another of this year's tech floatation to struggle after debut.
Chief Executive Officer Stewart Butterfield sought to calm nerves on a conference call with analysts by highlighting some wins over Microsoft Corp's (O:MSFT) competing Teams software.
""Several large wins at Office 365 customers make us feel incrementally better about Slack's ability to compete against Teams in the Office 365 customer base,"" analysts at  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) said.
The company is trying to become the main source of communication in workplaces but Teams in July had over 13 million daily active users, three million more than the last number given by Slack in January.
In a downside scenario, Credit Suisse's analysts said they expected competition with Microsoft and slower growth in free cash flow to potentially cut the stock's value to $25.
Slack's lack of profitability and valuation has been a concern for investors. The company trades at 20.68 times forward sales, much higher than its peers, according to Refinitiv data. 
Other cloud-technology focused stocks like Dropbox (O:DBX) are trading at 4.15 times forward sales, while Salesforce (N:CRM) trades at a multiple of 6.84 and Workday (O:WDAY) 9.57.
D.A. Davidson advised investors to wait for a further pullback before establishing a position in the shares.
The brokerage, however, said it was upbeat on the company's prospects. ""Stepping back, we like Slack for its near-ubiquitous nature, rapid growth, secular tailwinds and large market opportunity and our due diligence is very positive,"" D.A. Davidson analysts said.

Morningstar analysts also advised clients to stay on the sidelines until shares ""normalize"" after the direct listing.

595,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 05, 2019 05:13PM ET</span>",WeWork mulls slashing IPO valuation as skepticism rises over business model: sources,"By Joshua Franklin
(Reuters) - WeWork owner The We Company is considering slashing the valuation it will seek in an initial public offering (IPO) to a little over $20 billion, less than half the $47 billion valuation it achieved in a private fundraising round in January, people familiar with the matter said on Thursday.
The We Company's deliberations illustrate how growing investor skepticism over the U.S. office space sharing startup's lack of a roadmap to profitability, and its co-founder Adam Neumann's firm grip on its governance, are weighing on its IPO prospects. 
A dramatic drop in the We Company's valuation could also prove to be a seminal moment for the IPO expectations of Silicon Valley unicorns, or startups with a valuation over $1 billion.
Other high-profile stock market listings this year, such as those of ride-hailing companies  Uber Technologies Inc  (N:UBER) and  Lyft  Inc (O:LYFT), have fared poorly in subsequent trading, amid investor skepticism over their lack of a concrete plan to profitability.
In May, Uber completed its IPO at a valuation of $82.4 billion, well below the $120 billion bankers had told the company it could be worth in 2018. It still fared better than the We Company stands to, given that Uber's IPO valuation was higher than its most recent valuation of $76 billion in the private fundraising market.
The We Company has not yet launched its IPO road show to formally solicit feedback from investors. It may begin this process as early as Monday, according to one person familiar with the matter. 
The sources cautioned that no decision on the valuation has been taken and asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential. The We Company declined to comment. The Wall Street Journal reported earlier on Thursday that the We Company was considering an IPO valuation of around $20 billion. 
The We Company rents out workspace to clients under short-term contracts and pays rent for the properties under long-term leases. 
The New York-based company lost more than $900 million in the first half of 2019, up 25% from a year earlier, even as its revenue doubled to $1.54 billion, as it burned through cash to expand.
The mounting losses and concerns over how its business model would survive an economic downturn have raised skepticism from analysts and investors about the IPO. 
Complicating matters further, the company is looking to go public against a turbulent market backdrop, with the U.S.-China trade war making for the worst August for U.S. stocks in four years.
""The market has changed very much since Uber and Lyft went public. What investors want now is an appropriate discount to price in the risk and have greater comfort that it won’t fall below the IPO price,"" said Barry Oxford, a real estate analyst at D.A. Davidson & Company. 
SOFTBANK BACKING 
WeWork, which was rebranded We Company earlier this year, is backed by Japan's SoftBank Group Corp (T:9984), which has invested or committed to invest $10.65 billion since 2017.
We Company Chief Executive Neumann recently met with SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son to discuss SoftBank making an anchor investment in the IPO to support demand, or making a further private investment in the We Company in order to postpone the IPO, according to the Wall Street Journal.
SoftBank and its affiliates own around 29% of the company's shares compared to a 22% stake owned by Neumann, Bloomberg reported on Thursday, citing a person with direct knowledge of the matter.
The We Company has also faced a criticism from some investors over its extensive and unusual ties with Neumann, including him being a landlord to the company on some properties, and initial plans to go public with an all-male board. 
The We Company has disclosed it paid almost $17 million between 2016 and 2018 for leases on properties owned by Neumann.
The company on Wednesday took some steps to address these concerns by adding a woman, Frances Frei, to its board and announcing that its CEO would return a $5.9 million payment for use of the trademarked word ""We."" 
The We Company has not given a time frame for becoming profitable. 

J.P. Morgan Securities (N:JPM) and Goldman Sachs (N:GS) are among a nine-member underwriting team for the IPO.

BUENOS AIRES/MADRID (Reuters) - Argentina's likely next president, opposition front-runner Alberto Fernandez, laid out his populist credentials during a visit to Madrid on Thursday, saying local Argentine interests would trump those of creditors and energy investors.
In comments that followed a speech in the Spanish parliament, he indicated that, if elected, he would take a tougher stance on international access to Argentina's vast Vaca Muerta shale reserves, a magnet for investment.
""There's no point in having oil if in order to extract it you have to let multinationals come and take it away,"" he said. ""I don't have a problem with multinationals but my primary concern is to generate riches for Argentina and Argentines.""
Fernandez, a moderate Peronist running alongside populist ex-leader Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, added he was committed to meeting debt obligations as long as it did not harm Argentines.
""We'll do what we have always done, which is to fulfill and honor our debts, but we will not do it at the expense of our people,"" Fernandez said in expansive comments while in Madrid to teach university classes.
Wary investors have been seeking clues about how Fernandez would lead South American's No. 2 economy since he soundly defeated incumbent President Mauricio Macri in an August primary, dashing the center-right president's chances of winning a general election in October.
The shock result caused a market tailspin with the peso and bonds tumbling to record lows. Macri, who came to power in 2015 as a free-market champion and critic of interventionist policy, was forced to roll out plans to delay payments on around $100 billion of debt amid default fears and impose currency controls.
Those controls have stabilized markets, but the economic outlook has dimmed. A central bank poll of economists hiked its inflation forecast for the year to 55% and cut its outlook for the economy, which it now expected to shrink 2.5%.
On Thursday, Argentina's country risk fell by 155 points, easing after it recently hit its highest level since 2005 on political and economic concerns. The peso closed flat 56.04 per U.S. dollar, traders said.
The country's over-the-counter bonds continued to rise, up an average of 3%, while the domestic Merval stock index jumped almost 9% after a strong rise also on Wednesday.
On Thursday, ratings agency Fitch downgraded the debt of eight Argentine firms from telecoms to energy, saying it believes ""the current controls and risks of further tightening could potentially impair the private sector's ability to access foreign exchange to meet debt service.""
A day earlier, rival agency Moody's downgraded several major Argentine financial institutions' debt ratings, including Banco Hipotecario, Banco Supervielle and Banco Macro."

(Reuters) - U.S. stocks surged on Thursday on expectations of a de-escalation in trade tensions after Washington and Beijing agreed to hold high-level talks next month, while strong U.S. economic data eased fears of a domestic slowdown.
After anxiety about a deepening trade war triggered a sell-off in late July and early August, leading to speculation that a decade-long bull market was ending, the S&P 500 has largely recovered and is now less than 2% short of its July 26 record high close. The benchmark index has climbed 2.4% in the past two sessions.
China and the United States agreed to hold talks in early October in Washington, boosting markets as investors bet on a thaw in the trade war between the world's two largest economies, which has taken a toll on global growth.
Alternating signs of improvement and deterioration in the U.S.-China trade war, often based on tweets and comments from Trump, have repeatedly sparked volatility on Wall Street in recent months. 
""Whether the talks occur or not, we'll see. And whether they are productive, we're skeptical. But the market loves it,"" said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment strategist at Inverness Counsel in New York. 
The S&P information technology index (SPLRCT) rose 2.1%, while financials (SPSY) jumped 1.9%, the two rising the most among the 11 major S&P 500 sectors.
The interest rate-sensitive S&P 500 Banks Index <.SPXBK> surged 2.5%, following a rise in U.S. Treasury yields. [US/] 
The ADP (NASDAQ:ADP) National Employment Report, considered a precursor to the Labor Department's more comprehensive jobs report, showed U.S. private employers' payrolls grew at the fastest pace in four months in August, led by big gains in service-sector jobs.
Another private survey showed growth in U.S. services sectors accelerated in August, rebounding from its weakest level in nearly three years, as new orders rose to their highest level since February amid trade worries. 
The upbeat reports eased concerns of an economic downturn, which was exacerbated by data on Tuesday that showed a contraction in U.S. factory activity in August. Investors will keep a close watch on the crucial nonfarm payrolls data due on Friday. 
""Manufacturing is in a bit of a global slump, but if you look at the other economic data, like the services and jobs reports, none of them point to an economy that is teetering on a recession,"" said Michael Antonelli, market strategist at Robert W. Baird in Milwaukee.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) jumped 1.41% to end at 26,728.15 points, while the S&P 500 (SPX) gained 1.30% to 2,975.97.
The Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) surged 1.75% to 8,116.83.

Sectors viewed as defensive declined, with the S&P utilities index (SPLRCU), real estate index <.SPLRCR> and consumer staples index (SPLRCS) all down. 
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.93-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.84-to-1 ratio favored advancers.
The S&P 500 posted 56 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 74 new highs and 45 new lows.

About 7.5 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, compared with the 6.8 billion-share daily average over the last 20 sessions.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - General Motors (N:GM) Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Mary Barra said her face-to-face session with U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday was ""productive and valuable,"" but declined to offer specifics.
The head of the largest U.S. automaker met with Trump days after the president stepped up attacks on the Detroit automaker. He has been slamming GM for much of the last year after the company announced in November it would end production at four U.S. plants and eliminate thousands of jobs.
Barra, accompanied by GM general counsel Craig Glidden, declined upon leaving the White House to say if she discussed the fate of the shuttered Lordstown, Ohio plant with Trump. GM has been in talks to sell the plant to EV startup Workhorse Group Inc and an affiliated, newly formed entity.
People briefed on the matter said Trump and Barra were expected to discuss ongoing contract talks with the United Auto Workers union, the fate of the closing plants, trade issues with China and North America and the Trump administration's plan to rewrite fuel economy standards through 2026.
The White House declined to comment on the meeting.
Last Friday, Trump again criticized GM on Twitter saying the company ""which was once the Giant of Detroit, is now one of the smallest auto manufacturers there.""
Last week, Trump suggested GM should begin moving operations back to the United States from China. ""They moved major plants to China, BEFORE I CAME INTO OFFICE.... Now they should start moving back to America again?"" Trump said on Twitter.
GM did not directly comment on Trump's tweet last week but said its China operations ""are not a threat to U.S. jobs.""
Trump has previously attacked GM for building vehicles in Mexico and for ending production at plants in Michigan, Ohio and Maryland. He has threatened to cut GM subsidies in retaliation and in June rejected a request to waive tariffs on Chinese-made Buick Envisions.
Trump has warned GM not to join  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) and three other automakers in backing a voluntary deal with California for stricter fuel economy standards than the administration has proposed. GM has not backed the agreement, arguing that it does not properly credit the company's electric vehicles."

(Reuters) - Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc (N:WBA), CVS Health Corp (N:CVS) and supermarket chain Wegmans Food Markets Inc said on Thursday they would start asking customers to not openly carry firearms in their stores, joining Walmart Inc (N:WMT) and  Kroger Co  (N:KR), in a change of gun policy following several deadly mass shootings in the United States.
The retailers are among a growing number of U.S. companies, such as Delta Air Lines (N:DAL) and Bank of America (N:BAC), that are responding to calls for action to help curtail the rash of gun violence that has plagued the nation, risking backlash from powerful gun owners' groups as politicians consider options.
""We are joining other retailers in asking our customers to no longer openly carry firearms into our stores other than authorized law enforcement officials,"" Walgreens said in an emailed statement. 
Earlier this week, Walmart and Kroger said they would ask shoppers to stop openly carrying firearms in stores across the United States. Walmart also said it would discontinue sales of ammunition for handguns and some assault-style rifles in U.S. stores, and called for action on gun safety after a string of mass shootings, including at Walmart stores in Texas and Mississippi.
""There's nothing more important than the safety of our customers & employees,"" Wegmans said in a tweet on Thursday, adding that it ""prefers"" that customers not openly carry firearms into its stores. (https:// CVS Health echoed the sentiment saying, ""We join a growing chorus of businesses in requesting that our customers, other than authorized law enforcement personnel, do not bring firearms into our stores."" As the chains began making their announcements on Thursday, Shannon Watts, founder of gun control advocacy group Moms Demand Action said, ""We hope Senate leaders are watching this sea change."" ""We'll take this momentum to Washington when Congress is back from recess on Monday."" 
The Democrat-controlled House of Representatives passed a bill intended to close loopholes around background checks for gun purchases and other measures in February, but it has not been taken up by the Republican-led Senate.

601,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 05, 2019 03:35PM ET</span>",Latest Stock Rally Tests $18 Billion Trade to Cushion Gyrations,"(Bloomberg) -- Looking for a place to ride out recent market volatility? Equity investors have a suggestion.
With markets gyrating and a widely watched fear gauge spiking to its highest in seven months in August, billions of dollars have poured into strategies that hedge against wild swings. Exchange-traded funds focused on low-volatility stocks have lured a record $17.8 billion in 2019, almost double the haul of any full year, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
Safer areas of the market have benefited as trade tensions between the U.S. and China intensify, with a recent breakdown in negotiations between the two parties spurring fears of a protracted global slowdown. Investors are consequently cautious, but with the Federal Reserve signaling easier monetary policy, many are seeking yield in more protected equity strategies.
“People are looking for predictability and they’re getting it with these companies,” said Steven DeSanctis, a U.S. stock strategist for Jefferies. These funds offer good yield plays, he said, adding that “in a low interest-rate environment, they can hold up and perform well.”
While topping fund inflows is a rare occurrence for so-called smart-beta ETFs -- which focus on stocks with a particular set of characteristics -- two low-volatility products are among the year’s 25 most popular ETFs. Strategies tracking the S&P 500 Index and emerging markets have historically been more popular.
Low-volatility stocks turned out to be a good bet in August as stocks tumbled about 3% on three separate occasions, but also rallied more than 1% seven times. While the S&P 500 ended the month down 1.8%, less volatile equities advanced, delivering returns for funds run by the likes of BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK). and Invesco Ltd.
“It just fits the times,” said Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Eric Balchunas. “It’s ‘Hey, here’s equity markets, but with a little bit of edge.”’
But investors may be surprised by exactly what they own if they look beneath the hood of their low-volatility funds.
The $34 billion iShares Edge MSCI Min Vol USA ETF, known as USMV, has taken in more than half of all cash that’s gone into that category of funds this year, yet its largest allocation -- 16% -- is to technology stocks that are typically more associated with growth strategies, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
That’s because USMV is designed to stay within 5% of a broad MSCI Inc. index’s weightings. A rival product from Invesco, known as SPLV, instead buys the 100 least volatile companies across the S&P 500, skewing its portfolio toward utilities and financials. Both USMV and SPLV gained in August, but the latter returned an additional 76 basis points.
However, both funds proved popular as a net $19 billion exited equity ETFs in August. USMV saw a cash infusion on all but three days, with a record monthly inflow of $2.2 billion, while investors also added about $256 million to Invesco’s product, which recorded its 10th-straight month of inflows.
“You’re being exposed to equities, but you’re not getting those volatile swings,” said Shawn Cruz, manager of trader strategy at TD Ameritrade. “There definitely is a preference from investors that maybe they’re getting tired of seeing these swings in their holdings every day. They don’t want to see their portfolio swing 2% to 3% based off of some headline.”"
602,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 05, 2019 03:35PM ET</span>",Buy-the-Dip Bond Traders Are Scared of Momentum,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- During one of the strongest bond market rallies in history, the mantra “buy the dip” sounded like a pretty sound trading strategy. Actually executing that plan appears to be a different story.
Benchmark 10-year Treasury yields rose as much as 12 basis points on Thursday, the biggest intraday increase since November 2016. A combination of factors, including news that China and the U.S. would hold trade talks in early October, better-than-expected jobs data from the ADP Research Institute (accompanied by a presidential tweet) ahead of the Labor Department report on Friday, and the sharpest monthly rebound in business activity since early 2008 all fueled optimism that the global economy might yet avert a widespread recession. Even German 30-year yields turned positive for the first time in a month.
And yet it feels like one of the most insignificant double-digit basis point yield increases in recent memory. After all, as Bloomberg News reported, central bank policy makers have cut interest rates 32 times this year by a cumulative 13.85%, according to data from the Bank of International Settlements that track 38 central banks. For the Federal Reserve, it’s less a question of whether it will lower rates again later this month but by how much. Gary Shilling, writing for Bloomberg Opinion, reiterated that Treasury yields have yet to see a bottom. Alan Greenspan said again this week that it was only a matter of time before negative interest rates reached America’s shores.
It’s possible that the bond market has it all wrong; that traders went too far and talked themselves into a recession because of the inverted yield curve, but in reality the trends in the U.S. and global economy aren’t so dire. Thomas Simons at Jefferies quipped after the ISM non-manufacturing index beat expectations that “as has been the case many times over the past decade, reports of the demise of the U.S. economy have been greatly exaggerated.”
It’s also possible, as Bloomberg News’s Cameron Crise wrote, that “bonds have hit something of an extreme” and are due for a correction. There’s certainly no shortage of investors on edge about a bond bubble. 
However, it’s going to take more than one bad day to convince me that the massive repricing in August will reverse itself. Those who closely track the swings of the world’s biggest bond market seem to agree. This big move feels like little more than a fleeting turn in momentum after what was the fourth-strongest monthly performance for the longest-dated Treasuries in the past 27 years (or more than 300 months).
Jim Vogel at FTN Financial Capital Markets published a note (almost at the exact same time I started writing this) that said Treasuries maturing in five to 10 years were all “in the buy zone.” He urged traders not to wait to see what happens and whether the sell-off could deepen. “The move has such a big increase in real yields and decrease in risk premiums that it allows for an easy reassessment as early as this afternoon.” At the time of his report, 10-year yields were about 1.586%. He advocated buying until they fell back to 1.555%.
So far, though, dip buyers have been reluctant. It’s admittedly hard for many investors to get excited about these yield levels. Yes, they’re at a nearly two-week high, but as recently as April they were a full 100 basis points higher. The all-time low set in 2016 is 1.318%. The U.S. long bond is comfortably above 2%, and 30-year debt in Germany briefly rose above 0%, both of which seem like small victories for those who still believe in positive interest rates.
Ask most bond traders whether Treasury yields have reached a bottom, though, and I’d wager a sizable majority would say no. And yet there are still days like this in which yields can spike higher with few buyers in sight. Buying the dip and surfing the ranges is all well and good until a massive wave of momentum knocks you over."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A federal appeals court on Thursday threw out a $26.9 million award in favor of Sprint Corp (N:S), in a setback to the company's years-long campaign to stop what it calls cellphone trafficking.
In a 3-0 decision, the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, Virginia, said Sprint's contracts with customers who bought ""upgraded"" phones did not unambiguously prohibit those customers from reselling their phones to third parties.
The court overturned a June 2018 judgment against Wireless Buybacks LLC.
Sprint had accused the Odenton, Maryland-based company of wrongfully enticing customers still under contract with the mobile phone provider to sell their phones, and then reselling the phones at higher prices.
Lisa Belot, a spokeswoman for Sprint, said the company was disappointed and evaluating its next steps. Wireless Buybacks' lawyer could not immediately be reached for comment.
The case concerned Sprint's contract with customers who buy ""upgraded"" phones at steep discounts, whose cost the Overland Park, Kansas-based company recoups through required service contracts that can last two years.
Sprint claimed that resales cause harm because it loses money when it sells phones at loss-leader prices, and because customers may become dissatisfied if they sell upgraded phones with the latest technology and instead use older Sprint phones.
Writing for the appeals court, Circuit Judge Jay Richardson parsed the language of Sprint's contracts, and said U.S. District Judge Catherine Blake in Baltimore erred in concluding that Wireless Buybacks intentionally interfered with them.
""Sprint was not entitled to judgment as a matter of law,"" Richardson wrote. The appeals court returned the case to Blake for further proceedings.
After winning the $26.9 million award, Sprint had said there was a ""legitimate secondary market"" for cellphones, but customers were harmed by Wireless Buybacks' activities.
The case is  Sprint Nextel Corp  et al v Wireless Buybacks Holdings LLC et al, 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 18-1729."

""There's no point in having oil if in order to extract it you have to let multinationals come and take it away,"" he said in remarks following a speech at the Spanish parliament in Madrid.
""I don't have a problem with multinationals but my primary concern is to generate riches for Argentina and the Argentines,"" said Fernandez, the main challenger to President Mauricio Macri in the elections in October.
Seven years ago, former populist President Cristina Fernandez - who is Alberto Fernandez's running mate in this year's election - expropriated Repsol's (MC:REP) stake in Argentina's state-owned oil company YPF SA in a move that dented foreign appetite for energy investment in Argentina.
Macri, who was trounced by left-leaning Fernandez in a primary vote last month, has tried to cultivate a pro-business atmosphere to bring investors back to the country to develop energy assets.
Those include Vaca Muerta - a huge reserve about the size of Belgium that could house one of the biggest deposits of unconventional gas and oil in the world.
The country is expected to record an energy trade surplus next year for the first time in a decade, Energy Secretary Gustavo Lopetegui said on Thursday.
Former President Cristina Fernandez targeted Vaca Muerta to reverse Argentina's energy deficit but the plans were hindered by a lack of infrastructure and lack of investment."

BRASILIA/RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - A middleman in a graft scheme at Brazilian state oil company Petrobras has implicated the chairman of global energy trading firm Vitol in a bribery operation to obtain oil contracts, as well as two high-ranking executives at rival Trafigura and its former CEO, according to plea bargain testimony seen by Reuters.
The individuals named in the previously unreported documents are Ian Taylor, the chairman of Vitol, as well as Claude Dauphin, the former chief executive and chairman of Trafigura. Trafigura co-head of oil trading José Larocca and chief operating officer Mike Wainwright were also implicated in the alleged scheme.
According to the documents, which summarize a plea deal reached in August with federal prosecutors, businessman Carlos Henrique Nogueira Herz testified that the executives knew of millions of dollars in bribes paid to Petrobras employees.
An oil industry insider with decades of experience, Herz pleaded guilty in August to Brazilian prosecutors' charges that he formed a ""criminal group"" that used his contacts in the sector to funnel bribes from Vitol and Trafigura to Petrobras employees from 2011 to 2014 in return for sweetheart fuel trades benefiting the commodity trading firms.
If his accusations are proven, Herz's testimony would up the ante in an ongoing Brazilian investigation of the commodity trading industry - codenamed Operation Without Limits - as it brings accusations of wrongdoing to the top echelons of some of the sector's largest companies.
Herz provided prosecutors with dozens of pages of emails and bank statements, reviewed by Reuters, that offered extensive detail on the bribery scheme as a whole.
Herz provided no documentary evidence specifically linking Taylor to the allegedly illegal conduct. Herz said one of his business partners, a close personal associate of Taylor, informed him about the Vitol executive’s involvement in the bribery scheme.
He provided documents showing Trafigura’s Wainwright was copied on an email referencing what Herz alleges were bribe payments. In his August testimony, Herz said Wainwright was involved in facilitating the payments. 
He did not provide any documentary evidence showing the involvement of Trafigura executives Dauphin and Larocca, whom he alleged were both aware of the bribery scheme but not directly involved. 
BACK CHANNEL PAYMENTS 
In his testimony, Herz said he knew of the executives' knowledge and involvement in the alleged scheme in part because he personally set up a financial back channel in 2012 through which Trafigura bribes could be paid to Petrobras employees.
He provided to prosecutors dozens of pages of emails and bank statements detailing what he alleged were aspects of those negotiations. The documents did not mention or include correspondence from Dauphin or Larocca. 
Reuters could not independently confirm Herz's allegations about any of the executives. 
Reuters could not determine what advantage Herz gains by striking the plea bargain deal with prosecutors. However, defendants in Brazil are generally given reduced sanctions in return for their cooperation.
A lawyer for Herz did not respond to requests for comment on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD). The lawyer's legal offices did not pick up multiple phone calls. Prosecutors did not respond to a request for comment.
In a statement, Vitol said it would not be appropriate to comment on Herz’s testimony ""beyond reiterating our zero tolerance policy in respect of bribery and corruption and our policy of cooperating fully with the relevant authorities in all the jurisdictions in which we operate."" 
Vitol said Taylor had nothing to add. Taylor, who was also CEO at the time of the alleged incidents, did not respond to a LinkedIn message sent by Reuters. 
Petrobras said it had immediately begun internal inquiries after learning about Herz's plea bargain testimony and had removed employees named in the testimony from their positions.
Trafigura said in a statement that it was aware of reports of Herz' testimony but had not been contacted by Brazilian authorities in relation to the allegations. 
""Any suggestion that Trafigura's current management knew that its payments would be used to make improper payments to employees of Petrobras is not correct,"" the statement said. ""Trafigura has a zero tolerance policy on bribery and corruption."" 
The firm did not make Wainwright and Larocca available for comment and the two men did not respond emails from Reuters. Dauphin, who stepped down as Trafigura CEO in 2014, died in 2015. 
'PRIVILEGED INFORMATION'
The investigation is part of a larger probe in Brazil, known as Operation Car Wash, which started in 2014 and has taken down scores of elite businessmen and politicians throughout Latin America who until recently were thought untouchable.
The oil trading investigation became public knowledge in December when federal prosecutors alleged that Vitol, Trafigura,  Glencore  Plc (L:GLEN) and Mercuria Energy Group used intermediaries to pay at least $31 million in bribes to Petrobras employees to sell them oil at below-market rates and gain access to privileged information that gave them an edge over competitors when trading with the oil firm.
The companies, which together control about 10 percent of the world's daily oil consumption, have said they are cooperating with the Brazilian investigation.
In his testimony, Herz said that his business partner, Bo Ljungberg, negotiated a back channel through which Vitol paid bribes to Petrobras employees in exchange for confidential Petrobras information. 
That information gave Vitol a significant advantage over competitors when trading fuel with the state-run firm, according to the documents.
Ljungberg, a Swedish national, was indicted by Brazilian authorities in December for facilitating the alleged payments. He did not respond to Reuters messages on Facebook and LinkedIn requesting comment.
An Interpol alert has been issued for Ljungberg. Brazilian prosecutors said in December he had returned to Sweden. Reuters has not been able to locate a lawyer for Ljungberg.
Herz alleged that Taylor was directly involved in the negotiation of the bribes, which came to around 10 cents to 20 cents per barrel of oil exchanged between the companies.

Herz said he was kept abreast of interactions between Taylor and Ljungberg via conversations with the Swede, with whom he was a co-owner of various firms active in the trading industry, according to the documents.

Climate activists are calling for demonstrators to join anti-car protests during the car show, known as the IAA, which is due to take place from September 12 to 22.
""We are on course for a catastrophe,"" said Luise Neumann-Cosel, head of campaigns for German online petitions site Campact. ""We are in a car and we are driving at 250 km per hour toward an abyss... We need fewer cars.""
Neumann-Cosel accused car makers of failing to help reduce emissions because they are still pushing gas-guzzling SUVs that are more profitable than smaller cars.
The activist clashed with Bernhard Mattes, president of Germany’s VDA auto industry association.
""Do we really want to go to a quarter of people and say you have to give up your car?"" Mattes asked when environmentalists suggested that more radical policies were needed.
Ernst-Christoph Stolper, the deputy leader of the BUND environmental group, said the Frankfurt car show had been a showcase for the sector's resistance to change.
""The car industry has always fought against tougher policies. We would be happy if that changed but actions are more important than words.""
On Monday, the VDA said the Frankfurt car show will champion sustainable driving and electric cars, including Volkswagen's (DE:VOWG_p) ID 3 electric vehicle, Porsche's Taycan electric sports car, and Mercedes-Benz's fully electric van.
Britta Seeger, management board member for Mercedes-Benz maker Daimler, said her company was investing heavily in battery production and electric motor research.
""We are very serious about contributing to climate-neutral innovation of the future,"" she said.
More than 40 luxury vehicles were vandalized at a car dealership in Kronberg on the outskirts of Frankfurt last month, while climate activists also occupied railway lines supplying Volkswagen's Wolfsburg factory."

Dongfeng Peugeot Citroen Automobiles (DPCA), the joint venture based in Wuhan, central China, plans to reduce the break-even point to below 180,000 vehicles in 2019 and further reduce to below 150,000 vehicles between 2020 and 2021, according to a post on PSA's social media account in China.
The 27-year-old venture will start to consolidate manufacturing resources, dispose of idle assets, improve system efficiency and launch more models in China, according to the post. The goal is to revive annual sales to around 250,000 units between 2020 and 2021, and 400,000 units by 2025, it said.
Dongfeng Peugeot sold around 250,000 vehicles in China last year.
PSA is attempting a reboot under tough conditions in the world's largest vehicle market, once an auto industry cash cow. The Chinese market contracted last year for the first time since the 1990s and is expected to decline another 5% in 2019, squeezed by a trade tension between China and United States.
Peugeot is one of several global automakers, including  Ford Motor Co  (N:F), that have been forced to retrench as sales in China have tumbled.
Dongfeng Peugeot plans to launch 14 new models in China over the next three years. After 2020, every new model will have an electrified version that qualifies as a ""new energy vehicle"" under Chinese regulations, the post said.
A document seen by Reuters in July showed the joint venture plans to halve workforce and drop two of four shared assembly plants in China."

CHICAGO (Reuters) - Global grain trader and food processor Archer Daniels Midland Co allegedly manipulated the price of ethanol to profit from a short position it was holding in the derivatives market, according to a lawsuit by a rival firm.
AOT Holdings, a Swiss company that owns an energy trading subsidiary, filed the class action complaint late on Wednesday in U.S. District Court's Central District of Illinois Urbana Division, claiming damages from  ADM's actions of up to $6.33 million.
The lawsuit follows reporting by Reuters last year that ADM's ethanol selling had led traders to complain to S&P Global Platts, which provides benchmark pricing for the physical ethanol contract at different U.S. delivery points including Chicago.
According to the lawsuit seen by Reuters, ADM was aggressively selling ethanol on the cash market at the Argo terminal just outside of Chicago. The selling would start 30 minutes ahead of the close of the trading day, it said.
""The evidence indicates that ... much of ADM’s behavior was economically irrational and contrary to its self-interest as an ethanol producer -- unless it was intended to manipulate physical ethanol prices at the Argo Terminal,"" the lawsuit said.
Illinois-based ADM, a major ethanol producer, said in an email that it did not comment on pending litigation.
The selling on the physical market began in November 2017 and continues through ""today,"" the lawsuit said.
ADM's selling came during an upheaval in the domestic ethanol market as U.S. demand flatlined and export markets, including China and Brazil, were cut off due in part to the effects of U.S. President Donald Trump's widening trade disputes.
Ethanol producers typically hold short positions as a hedging strategy but AOT claimed that ADM's actions far outstripped those risk management needs.
""These huge positions represented a significant departure from ADM's previous hedging activities and bore no rational relationship to hedging ADM's exposure to physical ethanol sales, the lawsuit said.""
The lawsuit named ADM's Ray Bradbury and Adam Kuffel, two employees in the ethanol division, as the architects of the plan but said that senior executives also knew of their activities.
Bradbury and Kuffel could not be reached for comment.
Shares of ADM were up 57 cents at $38.81 on Thursday after hitting a one-month high of $38.90."

London is Europe's biggest financial center, but the CME (O:CME) has transferred trading in European government bonds and repos from London to its new hub in Amsterdam. The  London Stock Exchange  (L:LSE) has moved trading in European government bonds to its Milan base.
CBOE (Z:CBOE) will offer trading in EU shares at its new Amsterdam hub from October to replicate its London unit, with rival exchange Aquis (L:AQX) set to follow suit at a new Paris unit.
Maijoor said such preparations for Brexit were largely an issue for the private sector.
Paris-based ESMA directly authorizes and supervises credit rating agencies and trade repositories in the EU.
""There we have seen good progress on getting prepared for the risk of a no-deal Brexit,"" Maijoor said.
The likelihood of a no-deal Brexit began to recede this week as Britain's parliament approves a law to stop this from happening.
There has been concern in the funds industry that a no-deal Brexit would threaten a long-standing global practice known as delegation, whereby asset managers outside the EU can pick stocks for funds listed in the bloc.
Asset managers in London worried they would be under pressure to move to the EU.
""The EU27 do support the possibility for delegation because it's a generic way for global capital markets to work,"" Maijoor said.
""On the other hand, it must not undermine the possibility to have a fully-fledged entity in the EU27 and not a shell company, and an entity that can be supervised.""
ESMA, national regulators and Britain's Financial Conduct Authority have already signed cooperation agreements in the event of a no-deal Brexit, he added.
Fragmentation in Europe's capital market is inevitable to some extent because Britain is leaving the bloc and its common system of supervision and rules.
""Leaving the single market and starting a new separate regulatory framework is fragmenting markets,"" Maijoor said."

FRANKFURT/DUESSELDORF, Germany (Reuters) - Finland's Kone (HE:KNEBV) is considering teaming up with a private equity partner to pull off a bid for Thyssenkrupp's (DE:TKAG) elevator business, three people familiar with the matter said.
Kone has long been interested in Elevator Technology (ET) - which analysts say could be worth as much as 17 billion euros ($19 billion) - and has been exploring options for a deal with the help of Bank of America (N:BAC), sources told Reuters in May.
The Finnish company could mitigate antitrust risks by potentially selling assets to the partner, one of the people familiar with the matter said on Thursday.
No final decision has been made and Kone could still decide to submit an offer for the unit on its own, the people said.
Thyssenkrupp has said that it could sell or list its elevator business, which is by far its most profitable division.
Shares in the group, which will be kicked out of Germany's benchmark index later this month following a sharp fall in its market value, extended gains to close up 6.2% on the news that Kone was considering a bid with a partner.
Due to its large overlap with ET, a bid by Kone is likely to raise antitrust issues and would require substantial remedies to get approval, the sources said, adding that teaming up with private equity players would be a way to sidestep concerns.
Sources told Reuters on Wednesday that KKR (N:KKR), CVC, Bain and EQT were among those who received a letter from Thyssenkrupp asking them to express their interest in ET by the middle of the month.
PERFECT FIT
Kone declined to comment on whether it would team up with a partner to make a bid. But the group's CEO, in an interview on Thursday, said ET would be a perfect strategic fit for Kone.
""We have evaluated different scenarios and take the view that a tie-up is possible from an antitrust point of view. Both companies would benefit,"" Henrik Ehrnrooth told Rheinische Post in an interview.
He said Thyssenkrupp was stronger than Kone in North America, while Kone had a better position in Asia. ""In this combination we'd be faster and could tackle digital challenges more efficiently.""
In Kone's case, synergies are expected to be around 600 million euros annually, a person close to the deal said.
Rival elevator makers are in a position to pay a significantly higher price for ET as they would benefit from cost savings in a potential merger. At the same time, they would face higher antitrust hurdles than private equity firms.
Of the world's top elevator makers - which also include Otis (N:UTX) and Schindler (S:SCHP) - Hitachi (T:6501) would have the fewest antitrust issues, the people said.
German industrial conglomerate  Siemens  (DE:SIEGn), which has a strong building technologies business, is not interested in Thyssenkrupp's elevator unit and did not receive a letter on Wednesday, several people close to the matter said.
While Siemens has looked at a possible expansion into the elevators business in the past, it dismissed that idea after finding that there would be little synergy with its other businesses, the people said."

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's top auto industry executives called for the government on Thursday to take urgent steps to revive a sector crippled by plunging sales, leading to hundreds of thousands of job losses and lower production.
Indian auto sales are set to drop for the 10th straight month in August, marking one of the worst slowdowns in the history of the industry, which contributes more than 7% of India's GDP.
Several executives at the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers conference, India's biggest annual event for automakers, told Reuters the meeting appeared to be far less busy than usual, and reiterated long-standing calls for a cut in the goods and services tax (GST) on vehicles to revive demand.
Tata Motors (NS:TAMO) managing director Guenter Butschek warned of dire consequences if the government didn't act.
""The Indian automotive growth story is about to collapse,"" he said during a panel discussion.
Automakers, component manufacturers and dealers have laid off about 350,000 workers in India since the start of the financial year.
'HERE AND NOW'
Butschek said the government needed to let the industry know ""here and now,"" whether it planned to cut taxes on automobiles to give carmakers enough time to plan for India's upcoming festival season, which usually sees a surge in demand.
Tata separately said in a statement it had slashed vehicle production in August by 52% - its steepest cut in at least a decade, according to Reuters calculations.
Nitin Gadkari, India's Road Transport and Highways Minister, told the conference the government was working to help the sector and said he had asked the finance ministry to consider cutting taxes on petrol and diesel, as well as hybrid vehicles.
Indian auto stocks ended higher following Gadkari's remarks, with  Tata Motors Ltd  gaining 8% and  Maruti Suzuki India  Ltd (NS:MRTI) rising 2.5%.
Pawan Goenka, managing director of Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd (NS:MAHM), echoed Butschek's call for urgent action.
""There are concerns that the industry could face deeper problems if it does not recover before migration to BS VI,"" he said, referring to the requirement for new cars to use less polluting Euro VI fuel from the fiscal year starting April 2020.
If inventories of older Euro IV vehicles exceed demand in March, it could lead to ""very significant"" damage to the industry, he said.
Both Tata and Mahindra warned of steeper production cuts if the industry slowdown continues.
Mahindra, a manufacturer of SUVs and agricultural tractors, would defer some 10% of its annual capital spending, Goenka said. Separately, the company said on Thursday its production fell 37% in August.
India's largest automaker Maruti Suzuki Ltd (NS:MRTI) said on Wednesday it was shutting passenger vehicle manufacturing factories in Gurugram and Manesar in northern India for two days this month.
That's the first time the company has halted production due to lack of demand at both those plants, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters on Thursday.
Goenka said he expected more job cuts in he industry this fiscal year if the slowdown continued, adding Mahindra had already shed 1,500 temporary workers, or 5% of its workforce.
India's economy is cooling, with growth slowing to a more than five year low in April-June, and many key sectors including real estate and agriculture witnessing a slowdown."
623,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 05, 2019 12:21PM ET</span>",Swiss National Bank concerned about digital currencies impact on monetary policy,"By John Revill
ZURICH (Reuters) - Digital currencies like the Facebook-led Libra project which are linked to a basket of currencies could hinder the Swiss National Bank's ability to conduct monetary policy, SNB Chairman Thomas Jordan said on Thursday.
Jordan is the latest central banker to reveal worries about products like the Geneva-based Libra cryptocurrency, known as stablecoins because they avoid wild fluctuations in value because they are pegged to a group of stable currencies.
A stablecoin linked to the Swiss franc alone would create fewer problems, Jordan said, as it would be ""another Swiss franc-denominated form of money alongside bank deposits and cash.""
""As long as prices, wages and loans are set in Swiss francs, the SNB can influence incentives for savers and borrowers via its monetary policy and thus ensure price stability over the medium term,"" Jordan said in remarks prepared for a speech in Basel.
""However, if stablecoins pegged to foreign currencies were to establish themselves in Switzerland, the effectiveness of our monetary policy could be impaired.""
European Central Bank board member Yves Mersch this week said widespread acceptance of Libra posed a threat to the ECB's ability to set its monetary policy.
Depending on the Libra's level of acceptance and referencing the euro in its reserve basket, Mersch said, Libra could impair the monetary policy transmission mechanism by affecting the liquidity of euro area banks and undermine the single currency's international role by reducing demand for it.
Jordan said the issuers of some stablecoins--such as a Swiss franc stablecoin used widely for cashless payments or as a store of value--would effectively take on the functions of banks and would have to play by the same rules.
""If the economic function of stablecoins is comparable to that of bank deposits, their issuers should have to play by the same rules as banks,"" he said.
Stablecoin issuers should abide by regulations covering investor and data protection and rules combating money laundering and terrorism financing, Jordan added.
""Stablecoins present many regulatory challenges, which in turn require close cooperation between the various authorities. This is particularly true of cross-border projects like Libra,"" he said.
Unlike existing stablecoins, Libra will not have a fixed value in any single real-world currency, David Marcus, the head of the Libra project, told the U.S. Senate in July.
Instead, Libra will be fully backed through the Libra Reserve, which will hold a basket of currencies in safe assets such as cash bank deposits and government securities.
These currencies will include the dollar, the British pound, the euro, and the Japanese yen.
""The Libra Association...will work with the Federal Reserve and other central banks to make sure Libra does not compete with sovereign currencies or interfere with monetary policy,"" Marcus said in July.
""Monetary policy is properly the province of central banks."""

LONDON/ ABERDEEN, Scotland (Reuters) -  Exxon Mobil  (N:XOM) has agreed to sell its Norwegian oil and gas assets for up to $4 billion, marking the U.S. firm's exit from production in the country after more than a century, three sources familiar with the matter said on Thursday.
Exxon said in June it was looking to sell its Norwegian upstream portfolio, which comprises minority stakes in more than 20 fields, operated by local producer Equinor (OL:EQNR) and Anglo-Dutch oil major Royal Dutch Shell (L:RDSa).
An Exxon spokeswoman said: ""As a matter of practice, we don't comment on commercial discussions."" 
Shares in Exxon, the world's biggest publicly traded oil company, rose 1.7% to a session high in New York after Reuters reported a sale had been agreed.
The Irving, Texas-based company has held talks in recent weeks with a number of interested parties including Oslo-listed companies Equinor, Aker BP (OL:AKERBP), and DNO (OL:DNO), Stockholm-listed  Lundin Petroleum  (ST:LUPE) as well as Var Energi, backed by Italy's Eni (MI:ENI), and private equity firm Hitech Vision, industry sources said.
Equinor, Lundin, DNO and Var were not immediately available to comment. 
The three sources said that Exxon had closed the sale process in recent days with one buyer after agreeing on the terms of a sale.
Exxon hired investment bank Jefferies to run the sale process, banking sources told Reuters last month.
Jefferies declined to comment. 
In 2017, Exxon's net production from fields off Norway was around 170,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, according to its website.
The sale, if approved by regulators and completed, comes after Exxon focused in recent years on growing its onshore U.S. shale production, particularly in the Permian basin, as well as developing huge oil discoveries in Guyana.

Exxon is also considering selling its assets in the British North Sea after more than 50 years, industry sources told Reuters last month.

The 160-year-old company, which has been spending heavily on remodeling its stores and building off-price and online businesses, has relied on discounting to clear inventory, a move that has hurt its earnings.
Speaking at a retail conference hosted by Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), Chief Financial Officer Paula Price said some of the savings will be supported by better prices as the retailer moves towards targeted promotions for customers.
""We know that some of our customers respond particularly well to coupons while others do not. And so using data and customer analytics, we can become more precise on who we target with promotions and what offers we provide,"" Price said.
Macy's, the largest U.S. department store chain, has closed more than 100 stores and cut thousands of jobs as mall traffic falls amid a shift in customer preference to shop online.
The company said it is also testing self checkout in stores and rolling out new modernized handheld devices for staff to improve efficiency. 
The retailer also said it expects to drive about $100 million in additional working capital improvements.

Earlier this year, Macy's said it would cut 100 senior management positions to reduce costs and improve profitability.

The WeCompany, the parent company of share office rentals group   WeWork   (NYSE:WEWK), is considering slashing its valuation by more than half ahead of a public offering that was widely expected to take place this month, according to The Wall Street Journal.
It now expects a valuation of around $20 billion, less than half the $47 billion it notched at its last round of private funding, the WSJ said, citing people familiar with the matter. It added that the company hasn’t ruled out pushing back the IPO to next year, and last week discussed a further capital injection from core backer Softbank that would allow it to do just that.
The news come at a time when investors in some of the year’s biggest IPOs are already well under water, an experience that will hardly encourage them to bet on another loss-making unicorn. Uber (NYSE:UBER) has already lost 27% of its market value since listing in May and hit a new all-time low on Monday, while rival ride-sharing company   Lyft   (NASDAQ:LYFT) has lost 35% since it went public.
The WeCompany is reportedly looking to raise around $3 billion from the sale, and another $6 billion in debt finance loosely tied to the IPO. According to Bloomberg, the availability of the credit is dependent on the IPO raising at least $3 billion, and on the company meeting various performance targets thereafter.
The WeCompany’s IPO prospectus had been poorly received last month, with many criticizing it as trying to mask a questionable business model with obscure accounting metrics and Silicon Valley buzzwords. The prospectus said the company, which lost $1.9 billion last year, had a mission to “raise the world’s consciousness.”
Potential investors also criticized what they saw as an over-complex legal structure and the governance risks arising from the fact that CEO and founder Adam Neumann will keep near-complete control over the company even after the offering.
The WSJ reported that Neumann flew to Tokyo last week to discuss various options with Softbank CEO Masayoshi Son, who has already committed billions of dollars to the company. The options included Son’s Softbank acting as an anchor investor in the IPO."

628,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 05, 2019 10:16AM ET</span>",GM will use Google to power future infotainment systems,"By Joseph White
DETROIT (Reuters) - General Motors Co (N:GM) will use embedded Google technology to power navigation, voice activated controls and other vehicle infotainment functions starting in 2021, in a win for Alphabet Inc (O:GOOGL) in the race with Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and other technology companies to control dashboards.
GM said it will offer Google Assistant, Google Maps and other applications available through the Google Play app store in all its vehicle brands outside China, which is GM's largest single market. GM said the first vehicles with built-in Google infotainment technology will launch in 2021, with more models rolling out in the following years.
Google has previously struck deals to embed infotainment technology in cars built by allied automakers Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi and Volvo Cars, owned by China's Zhejiang Geely Holding Group.
Amazon is wooing automakers to embed its rival Alexa voice assistant technology in vehicles.
For years, GM and other automakers were reluctant to share dashboard space with Google, Apple Inc (O:AAPL) and other tech companies. Automakers feared losing control of valuable data, and having their brands eclipsed by powerful Silicon Valley names.
Consumers are, however, forcing automakers to shift gears. Connecting smartphones and apps to cars can be a clumsy experience because of automakers' poor technology, but having functionality built in from internet giants has begun to make for a smoother experience.
""We have the ability today to give commands to vehicles with embedded voice assistants. It is very limited,"" Santiago Chamorro, GM's vice president for Global Connected Customer Experience, said in an interview. ""With Google voice assistant it is a better experience for them.""
Patrick Brady, Google's vice president of engineering, said the issue of harvesting and monetizing data is ""blown out of proportion"" when it comes to cars.
""We are working to bring services into the car,"" he said. Google will not have access to data about the way an individual drives, or data about the vehicle's maintenance needs, he said.
GM could though enable customers to schedule vehicle maintenance using Google's voice commands, Chamorro said.
The automaker said pricing for packages that include Google services will be set closer to vehicle launches. GM will continue to offer Apple Inc's CarPlay and AndroidAuto to allow consumers to project a version of their smartphone screen onto a dashboard screen.
GM was a pioneer in offering drivers an on-board concierge service through its Onstar telematics system, which connects drivers to human operators. Some of the services those operators provide, such as turn-by-turn navigation, Google technology delivers with its automated system.
Chamorro said GM will continue the Onstar service, which GM has promoted recently as a form of insurance, connecting motorists to an operator who can help in an emergency. ""That is fundamentally a human activity,"" Chamorro said. ""We have 100 trained technicians"" who can respond when an Onstar customer is in danger.
For Google, the GM agreement offers the potential of embedding technology in as many as 3.6 million cars annually - the number of vehicles GM sold outside China last year. The Renault-Nissan alliance sells more than 10 million vehicles a year. Google's Brady said the company is discussing deals with other automakers but for now is focused on launching embedded systems with GM, Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi and Volvo.
""We are mostly focusing on making those partnerships successful,"" he said."

The talks were agreed to over the phone, the Chinese Commerce Ministry said, which was confirmed by a spokesman for the U.S. Trade Representative's office. No terms of the talks were given.
U.S. tariffs on over $100 billion worth of Chinese goods went into effect on Sept. 1 and plans to increase rates to 30% from 25% on another $250 billion worth of Chinese imports are set for Oct 1. 
The Dow jumped 397 points or 1.5% by 9:49 AM ET (13:49 GMT), while the S&P 500 gained 33 points or 1.2% and the Nasdaq composite was up 103 points or 1.3%.

Chipmakers, which are sensitive to tariffs, surged higher after the open, with Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and Nvidia up over 4%. The sector had received an upgrade from JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) analysts on Wednesday, who said they expect a strong rebound to global demand for chips in the second half of this year.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) was up 2%, while Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) inched up 1.3%, the broader macro backdrop outweighing new of yet another privacy lapse that exposed the phone numbers of 419 million users. 
Messaging software group Slack slumped 15% after it forecast a slightly larger-than-expected loss per share for the fiscal third-quarter in its first earnings report since going public.

Elsewhere, The Wall Street Journal reported that the parent of WeWork is considering slashing its valuation ahead of an initial public offering expected later this month. The WSJ said the valuation may be as low as $20 billion, less than half the $47 billion registered at its last private round of funding. The WeCompany's IPO prospectus was poorly received last month, with many pointing to the lack of a clear path to profitability and to governance risks arising from a share structure that leaves founder and chief executive Adam Neumann in near-total control of the company even after the IPO.

BEAULIEU-SUR-LAYON, France (Reuters) - LVMH's (PA:LVMH) Louis Vuitton brand will hire another 1,500 manufacturing staff in France by 2022, as it expands production to meet strong demand in markets like China.
The label, LVMH's biggest revenue driver, makes the bulk of its trademark leather and canvas handbags in its home market, where it employs around 4,300 people in 16 leather goods workshops. 
It will take on an additional 1,500 over the next two to three years as these factories get up to full capacity and it opens two more, Vuitton said on Thursday. 
It also said it could add a further site next to its newly opened workshop outside the village of Beaulieu-Sur-Layon in western France, a region that used to specialize in shoe production though the industry has waned in recent decades.
The brand tends to hire locally and train staff. 
Like rivals including Kering's (PA:PRTP) Gucci, Vuitton is riding high on strong appetite among young Chinese consumers for branded goods. 
Demand from these customers accelerated at Vuitton in the second quarter from the first three months of the year in spite of a Beijing-Washington trade war. 
""Demand in China is exceptionally high,"" Vuitton's CEO Michael Burke told reporters at the Beaulieu workshop, where it assembles bags like the $2,970 ""Lock Me"" model. 
Vuitton also has three production sites in the United States that cater to U.S. market. But the brand has no plans to relocate any manufacturing to China or Asia to be closer to this huge pool of sales, Burke said. 
""Why change a model that's working beautifully?"" he told reporters, adding Asian customers were not interested in products made in the region. Vuitton tends to trade off its ""Made in France"" cachet. 
""It's a strategy that's based on what our clients are looking for,"" he said. 
Burke also said the brand aimed to eventually recycle all unsold goods as its fine tunes its manufacturing process to limit excess inventories. It already recycles all metal fixtures and nearly all leather products, he added. 

Luxury brands are under pressure from consumers and environmental campaigners over their green credentials, after brands like Britain's  Burberry  (L:BRBY) revealed they sometimes destroyed unsold stocks to try to preserve an exclusive image.

639,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 05, 2019 08:45AM ET</span>",History Shows Traders Get What They Want With Fed Rate Cuts,"(Bloomberg) -- As the age of the disruptive tweet lays waste to much of the market’s conventional wisdom, at least one truth holds: The Federal Reserve decides when to hike, and the market decides when to cut.
The past quarter-century shows that when Fed easing is at least 50% priced in days before a policy decision -- as it is for the Sept. 18 meeting and beyond -- the central bank has always reduced rates, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. U.S. President Donald Trump, who last month called for at least 100 basis points of cuts, may well envy such a track record.
If Fed Chairman Jerome Powell wants to break with precedent and convince traders that a quarter-point cut in two weeks is no fait accompli, he has a last chance to say something game-changing Friday in Zurich. The economic backdrop suggests he won’t.
The nation’s manufacturing activity just contracted for the first time since 2016, and the Treasury yield curve inverted this year, a move that’s preceded every recession since the 1960s. Any disappointment in Friday’s payrolls report could stoke fears that the global risks that the Fed cited as motivating its July rate reduction may have arrived in the U.S.
“The market has a good sense of telling us where the dangers are, what’s coming next,” said Jim Bianco, president and founder of Bianco Research LLC in Chicago. “The funds rate is the single highest interest rate in the developed world right now -- the market is saying that the funds rate’s too high.”
While the central bank always delivers on anticipated cuts, data going back to 1994 -- when the Fed first started announcing a target rate -- show it doesn’t always obey traders. As the Fed dramatically eased during the 2008 financial crisis, hikes were priced in -- but, since markets were haywire at the time, that can probably be ignored.
During the tightening cycle of 1994-95, then-Chairman Alan Greenspan confounded market expectations by standing pat on several occasions and hiking more aggressively than anticipated on others. A little more than five months after the final rate increase, the Greenspan Fed delivered a short burst of cuts to secure what was to become a record economic expansion.
That mid-’90s episode is relevant today. The Fed raised rates from 2015 through last December, and cut in July in what Powell described as a “mid-cycle adjustment.” But Powell faces a significant hitch in his efforts to protect this historic growth cycle as global trade slumps. Unlike two decades ago, the market is not just expecting a cut, but quite a lot of them. And so the Fed is playing catch up, and some say its goal may be undermined by paying too much heed to the market’s demands.
Distortion Risk
That is, policy makers risk getting dragged by an apparent consensus on as many as three more cuts this year. That could set up bigger problems, such as excessive leverage or asset price bubbles.  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). economist Jan Hatzius noted twice in recent weeks that the role of markets in the Fed’s thinking appears to have become larger, if not distorted. He invoked Greenspan’s successor, Ben Bernanke, who in 2004 described policy that strives too hard to meet market expectations as a “hall of mirrors.”
“We run the risk of being in that echo chamber,” said Tim Horan, the New York-based chief investment officer of fixed income at Chilton Trust Co., a $5 billion money manager. “The market has priced for cuts and the Fed has caught up to some of this because of their assessment of the risks, particularly the uncertainty of trade.”
But the Fed’s relationship with the market may be more complicated now -- in this era of low interest rates and less room to maneuver -- than it was 25 years ago. Its dovish pivots in 2019 are part of a campaign of clearer communications with the market, in order to deploy more policy levers, to greater effect.
“This is the way they think central bank communications ought to work,” said Lou Crandall, economist at Wrightson ICAP (LON:NXGN) LLC in New York. “Fed easing gets into the bloodstream faster if the market can anticipate it.”
Since the Fed started projecting the trajectory of interest rates in the dot plot, market expectations of the long-term average fed funds rate -- as measured by the 10-year OIS swap -- have never exceeded the central bank’s own projection.
Horan doesn’t think policy distortions are inevitable. He says central banks everywhere are operating with “a limited amount of firepower -- they’ve got to use it most effectively.” He said the Fed is “also understanding of its responsibility to lead the market here, in shaping those views.”
Some policy makers have expressed more concern than others about the market’s signals, in particular the yield curve’s inversion. Powell’s predecessor, Janet Yellen, last month expressed a view popular among some experienced hands, that this indicator may be less informative these days given how central bank policy has depressed yields over the past decade. St. Louis Fed President James Bullard is an outlier in suggesting that curing the curve should be a policy goal. Indeed, any effort to do so with deeper cuts might prove futile if asset purchases are again needed to stimulate the economy.
While Bianco is a big believer in cuts, he doesn’t see the Fed getting dragged all the way to zero from the current benchmark rate of 2% to 2.25%. He recommends the Fed stopping at 1%, at which point long-end yields should have lifted sufficiently to restore a more normal incline to the curve. Aggressive cuts to catch up with the market will increase the chances for growth to strengthen and inflation to rise, and then traders will be ready again for the Fed to start dictating to them about the need for tighter policy.
“But if you keep cutting rates slowly, you’ll never get there in terms of where the market is,” Bianco said."

Viagogo and the CMA have been in court on the issue of the use of ""hover text"" to display the face value of tickets and the deadlines for people to claim for refunds. Hover text is when users place their cursor over certain text to get additional information on a website.
CMA had also stated that the company was selling tickets with resale restrictions, misleading on availability of tickets and non-disclosure of certain seat numbers.
The watchdog had said in July that it would take further legal action against the company for contempt of court following concerns that it had failed to comply fully with an earlier court order.
""Viagogo has now addressed the UK competition authority's outstanding concerns about how it presents information,"" the CMA said on Thursday.
It added that a further independent review of Viagogo's compliance with the court order will be completed in October, and if results suggests the company is not meeting its obligations then the CMA could take further action – through the courts if necessary.
The secondary ticketing market, which resells tickets for events ranging from pop concerts to tennis and soccer matches, has come under fire from politicians and regulators for sometimes sky-high prices and misleading customers.
""Viagogo is pleased it has been able to work with the CMA to find solutions to the final few areas of discussion ... Looking ahead we will continue to work with them to ensure we are delivering the best possible service for our customers"", Viagogo spokesman said in an emailed statement.
The CMA first said in August last year that it would take Viagogo to court after the company failed to make changes to business practices that broke consumer law."

JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co. recommends buying bearish options on the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust because the market may be underpricing risks that a deterioration in corporate America’s health could hurts jobs. Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) suggests put-option trades because its model suggests increasing risk of trouble for the S&P 500. And  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) SA and  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Group AG see some pockets in options tied to the index that are cheap.
The recommendations come after a turbulent August that saw markets gyrate to headlines on the U.S.-China trade war, tweets from President Donald Trump and comments from Federal Reserve officials. Another set of U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods took effect Sept. 1. Even so, the S&P 500 gained 1.1% on Sept. 4 to within 3% of its July peak, and futures rose in Asian hours on news that the U.S. and China will meet for trade talks early next month.
JPMorgan strategists Shawn Quigg and Marko Kolanovic say buying protection may be rewarding amid a likely weakening in the jobs data. Softening unemployment figures could weigh on equities, and options are pricing a move on the SPY (NYSE:SPY) ETF of about 1% through Sept. 6, which they deem as cheap.
Trade ideas from the firms include:
JPMorgan: Buy Sept. 6-expiry SPY $292 put optionsBofAML: Buy one S&P 500 October 2,825 put, selling two 2,700 puts and buying one 2,575 putSocGen: Sell one S&P 500 95% put with a December 2020 maturity, while buying 4.5 times the 70% putCredit Suisse: Hedge with SPY put strategiesSocGen Financial Engineer Aymen Boukhari notes that short-term S&P 500 volatility skew is very steep, meaning puts are in demand relative to calls. Far out-of-the-money puts are very cheap compared with at-the-money puts, Boukhari said by email.
Credit Suisse’s Mandy Xu also says relative cheapness in puts that are far below current index levels with three-month expiry and shorter, amid little demand for the far out-of-the-money tails versus greater popularity of options closer to index levels.
BofAML’s models of market stress are flashing caution, causing strategists led by Lars Naeckter and Stefano Pascale to advice hedging bullish wagers."

In their conclusions, seen by Reuters, the judges said the pilots of the Airbus A330 had failed to process all the warnings and instrument readings provided by the aircraft.
The plane plunged into the ocean en route from Rio de Janeiro to Paris after entering an aerodynamic stall and falling from an altitude of 38,000 feet during a storm, its engines running but its wings losing lift.
""The direct cause of the accident is the crew's loss of control of the aircraft's trajectory,"" the judges determined.
Other crews, faced with similar situations, had successfully maintained control of their aircraft, their ruling said.
The magistrates overruled the prosecutors investigating the case, who had recommended that Air France stand trial over the crash in July. The magistrates followed the prosecutors' recommendation to drop the charges against Airbus.
In their 2012 report, French accident investigators found the crew of AF447 mishandled the loss of speed readings from sensors blocked with ice and pushed the jet into a stall by holding the nose too high."

NEW DELHI (Reuters) -  Anheuser-Busch InBev  (BR:ABI) will face a ""substantial adverse impact"" on its business in New Delhi and is already incurring losses due a ban on its beer sales in the city amid allegations of tax evasion, it said in a court filing seen by Reuters.
The ban could be a major setback for AB InBev, which is also battling a separate antitrust probe in India linked to alleged beer price fixing by SABMiller (LON:SAB), which it acquired in 2016 for around $100 billion, and other firms, industry executives say.
Local authorities in July barred AB InBev, the world's largest brewer, from selling all its beer brands in New Delhi for three years on allegations of evading local taxes. AB InBev has denied the allegations.
An Indian court on Tuesday rejected a request from the brewer to put the ban on hold, saying it must first complete the appeals process before the state authorities.
Describing the ban as ""irrational and perverse"", the company said it would ""face substantial adverse impact on its business operations and livelihood in Delhi and is in fact incurring losses due to black listing"".
It did not disclose any specific loss figure.
""Apart from loss of goodwill and reputation, the domestic beer business of the petitioner has come to a complete standstill in New Delhi,"" AB InBev added in the court filing dated Sept. 2, which has previously not been reported.
A counsel for the Delhi government in the case, Ramesh Singh, did not comment on the contents of AB InBev's court filing, but said ""going by records, it seems like a classic case of excise duty evasion"".
The Delhi government's ban order came after a three-year investigation which found that beer maker SABMiller used duplicate barcodes on its bottles supplied to city retailers in 2016, allowing it to pay lower levies.
Citing its excise payments of $26 million to the city authorities during 2016-2019, AB InBev argued the ban will hit the state exchequer and lead to ""potential increase in illicit alcohol/moonshine trade"" as its beer brands were popular.
AB InBev's beer portfolio includes famous brands such as Budweiser, Hoegaarden, Corona and Stella Artois.
It is the second-biggest player in India's $7 billion beer market, accounting for a 17.5% market share, according to research firm IWSR Drinks Market Analysis.
AB InBev has previously said it was hopeful of receiving a fair hearing from the Delhi authorities as it believed appropriate excise duty payments were made and the allegations dated back to 2016, before its takeover of SABMiller.
Calling the Delhi government's order an ""excessive exercise of jurisdiction"", AB InBev in its court filing said it was not receiving a fair and effective opportunity in its appeals."

The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) published a framework that supervisors can use to test the resilience of funds to shocks.
ESMA said that in a test case it applied the framework to 6,000 bond funds to simulate a redemption shock, or heavy calls from investors for their cash.
""The results show that overall, most funds are able to cope with such extreme but plausible shocks, as they have enough liquid assets to meet investors’ redemption requests,"" ESMA said in a statement.
""However, pockets of vulnerabilities are identified, especially for high yield (HY) bond funds.""
Under the new framework's ""severe"" assumptions, up to 40% of high yield bond funds tested could end up with too little liquid assets to meet redemptions."

ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkey is increasingly confident German carmaker Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) will build a production plant in the country after an ""extremely positive"" meeting between a senior company official and President Tayyip Erdogan this week, three Turkish sources said.
Reuters reported last week that the two sides had been holding talks over Turkey's vehicle tax regime to conclude the 1 billion euro ($1.1 billion) investment.
The carmaker, which has also considered making the investment in Bulgaria, has not announced a final decision, but sources have said Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) is positive about investing in Turkey.
Erdogan and a high-ranking VW official overcame most of the problems during a meeting this week, one Turkish source with knowledge of the matter said. A Volkswagen source said Erdogan had met with VW Chief Executive Herbert Diess this week.
""There were previously some small issues, such as the tax arrangements on the cars that will be sold. In the meeting, an almost complete agreement was reached,"" the Turkish source said. ""If there isn't a last minute problem, the investment will be made in Turkey.""
Steep Turkish taxes on larger cars limit most buyers and local producers to smaller engine sizes. Cars with engines of less than 1.6 liters made up 96% of Turkey's new car market in 2018. A source had said Turkey was trying to find a formula to address Volkswagen's concerns without putting existing car producers at a disadvantage.
Major producers such as  Fiat  (MI:FCHA),  Renault  (PA:RENA), Ford (N:F), Hyundai (KS:005380) and Toyota (T:7203) produced more than 1.3 million motor vehicles in Turkey last year.
Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis said on Tuesday during a visit to Ankara that Volkswagen is making a big investment in Turkey.
A second Volkswagen source said only minor matters still had to be clarified, mainly on tax issues. The agreement was expected to be reached in a few weeks and the plant was expected to be built in the western Manisa province, the source said.
""There is no problem any longer about thinking that the investment will be made in Turkey. This decision will be announced in a short while after the final adjustments are made,"" a second Turkish source said."

Commodities revenue at the 12 banks rebounded last year from its lowest in more than a decade in 2017. That rise came from power, gas and base metals.
That revenue stream has been on a steady downward trajectory since the global financial crisis as heightened government regulation and poor performance made the top banks shrink their commodities businesses, falling to $3.6 billion last year from $15.9 billion in 2008, according to Coalition.
In the first six months of 2019, revenue from commodity trading, selling derivatives to investors and other activities in the sector was $2 billion, the financial industry analytics firm said.
""Oil revenues increased significantly, however power and gas declined due to fewer large structured deals,"" Coalition said.
The 12 banks Coalition tracks for its quarterly reports are Bank of America Merrill Lynch (N:BAC),  Barclays  (L:BARC),  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP),  Citigroup  (N:C),  Credit Suisse  (S:CSGN),  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), Goldman Sachs (N:GS), HSBC (L:HSBA), JPMorgan (N:JPM),  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS),  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) and UBS (S:UBSG)."

Investing.com -- Shares in U.K. online fast-fashion chain   Boohoo  .com (LON:BOOH) leaped 14% to a new all-time high Thursday after the company raised its guidance for the current financial year.
Ahead of its scheduled half-year update, the company said it now expects sales to grow by between 33% and 38% in the 12 months through next February. It had previously guided for sales growth of 25%-30%.
It also upheld its guidance that its EBITDA margin would stay at around 10% this year, banishing fears that the need to invest in rapid upscaling would eat into profits as it has done among some of its rivals.
The shares rose as high as 285.95 pence before retreating to 277.36 by 4:30 AM ET (0830 GMT), still a gain of 14% on the day. They’re now up 58% so far this year, with only German rival Zalando (DE:ZALG) – which had fallen much more sharply at the end of 2018 – performing better in the fashion space.
The latest upgrade to Boohoo’s forecasts comes only weeks after its latest acquisitions, which bolstered a growing reputation for snapping up brands on the cheap. It bought the online business of Karen Millen and Coast out of insolvency proceedings last month, in what could be a significant departure upmarket for a company that has previously concentrated on low-cost items for the younger audience.
Further afield, Europe’s markets rose for a fifth day out of the last six, supported by hopes of trade détente between the U.S. and China after the Chinese Commerce Ministry said they would meet for talks in early October. The U.S. side said only the talks would take place “in the coming weeks.”
The benchmark Euro STOXX 600 was up 0.5% at 385.24, its highest since early August. It’s now up 5.5% from the depths it plumbed after the escalation of the trade war at the start of last month.
The German DAX was the biggest beneficiary, with exporters and cyclical goods pushing it to a 0.8% gain. That was despite a bigger-than-expected drop in manufacturing orders in July that puts Europe’s biggest economy on track for a second straight quarter of contraction in the third quarter.
The rally in Italy also continued, the FTSE MIB adding 0.4% as the new government of Giuseppe Conte was sworn in. In both Germany and Italy, chipmakers were the biggest gainers after a sectoral upgrade from JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) on Wednesday. Infineon (SIX:IFXGn) rose 4.3% while STMicroelectronics (PA:STM) was up 4.0%.
The U.K. FTSE 100 was the only major index in negative territory, reflecting further gains in sterling after the House of Commons voted to block a ""No-Deal"" Brexit on Oct. 31. The bill is likely pass into law by Friday, according to the Press Association, but that won’t end the political uncertainty, as Prime Minister Boris Johnson continues to press for a General Election."

LONDON (Reuters) - European shares rose to fresh one-month highs and safe-haven assets such as gold and the yen fell after news of U.S.-China talks set for early October raised hopes of a de-escalation in their trade war before it further damages the world economy.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 0.63% to touch its highest level since Aug. 1. France's CAC 40 index jumped 0.79% to hit a more than one-month high, outperforming major European bourses, aided by a 8% rise in shares of engine maker  Safran  (PA:SAF) after the company upped its full-year profit forecasts.
The rally followed gains in Asia, with MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan gaining as much as 1.08% to reach its highest since Aug. 2.
U.S. stock futures reversed early losses and rose 0.5%.
The Chinese yuan jumped versus the dollar in offshore trade, while safe-haven assets such as gold, the Swiss franc, and the yen fell.
China's Commerce Ministry said on Thursday its trade team would consult with their U.S. counterparts in mid-September in preparation for negotiations in early October, hinting at progress in reducing trade friction.
Both sides agreed to take actual actions to create favorable conditions, the ministry added, without giving more details.
""The general market tone is driven by the announcement of the meeting of high-ranking officials between China and the U.S,"" said Francois Savary, chief investment officer at Swiss wealth manager Prime Partners.
""But this is not a sustained move into risk-on mode as nothing concrete has come out of it yet and investors need to wait to see whether the meeting will happen and what the results from it will be.""
BREXIT NEWS ALSO A POSITIVE
Adding to the upbeat mood, a parliamentary vote in Britain put the brakes on the nation's no-deal exit from the European Union, Hong Kong withdrew a contentious extradition bill that sparked recent protests in the Chinese-ruled city and weeks of political turmoil in Italy appeared to ease. 
""Since yesterday, there has been limited downside in markets because of what happened in Hong Kong, but now the U.S.-China talks are the story,"" said Masayuki Kichikawa, chief macro strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Asset Management Co in Tokyo.
""It's the same about Brexit, which means less downside risk.""
Any sign that Washington and Beijing are closer to scaling back or resolving their trade dispute would lift a significant burden from the global economy, but many analysts believe the two sides are dug in for a longer and costlier battle.
Weighing on sentiment was data that showed German industrial orders fell more than expected in July on poor demand from abroad, indicating manufacturers in Europe's biggest economy continue to struggle in the third quarter.
In European stocks, Dassault Aviation joined Safran in a sharp rise thanks to upbeat earnings updates. Dassault rose 9%. News of a $5 billion share buyback sent Equinor up 5.8%.
UK bank CYBG slumped 19% after saying it expected to increase its provision for legacy payment protection insurance by to 450 million pounds ($552 million). 
In currency markets, the British pound lost some of its overnight gains on concern that an election is still pending, although Britain might have averted leaving the European Union next month without a transition deal.
Lawmakers are hoping to pass a bill that seeks to stop Britain from leaving the European Union on Oct. 31 with no agreement.
Against the dollar, the pound fell 0.3% to $1.2211, after jumping 1.4% on Wednesday.
Against the offshore yuan, the dollar fell as much as 0.2% to 7.1340 yuan.
Spot gold fell 0.6% to $1542.38 per ounce. 
The dollar rose 0.17% to 106.60 yen and gained 0.3% to 0.9839 Swiss franc.
The 10-year German Bund rose more than 1 basis point to -0.66%, away from the record lows of -0.743% touched on Tuesday.
Seizing on recent doubts about whether a European Central Bank stimulus package next week can match expectations, other top-rated euro zone yields also increased,, although the rises were small.
Having spiraled lower in the past week after agreement was reached on a new coalition government in Rome, Italian yields steadied near their record lows.
The 10-year Italian yield was unchanged at 0.826%, close to the record low of 0.803%. The and 30-year Italian bond yields were also little moved in early trade.

U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude was 0.6% down at $55.91 per barrel.

655,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 05, 2019 04:44AM ET</span>",Danske Hires Commerzbank CFO in String of Management Changes,"(Bloomberg) --   Danske Bank   A/S (CSE:DANSKE) unveiled a number of changes to its executive team, including a new chief financial officer taken from   Commerzbank AG   (DE:CBKG).
Chief Executive Officer Chris Vogelzang, who started at Danske in June, presented a revamped team of top managers to help steer Denmark’s biggest bank through the fallout of its vast money laundering scandal. Stephan Engels will become CFO in April, replacing Christian Baltzer, who will leave the bank after less than a year, Danske said on Thursday.
Vogelzang said Engels, who has also held senior positions at the top of the German car industry, brings “strong execution expertise and management experience.”
The re-organization follows a series of executive purges at Danske and marks the second time Vogelzang has made changes since taking the helm just a few months ago. His predecessor, Thomas Borgen, has had preliminary criminal charges brought against him because of the laundering affair. An interim CEO who ran the bank before Vogelzang joined, Jesper Nielsen, was fired not long ago for his role in a separate scandal, in which Danske overcharged retail investors.
As part of the organizational adjustments announced on Thursday, Danske said it will make its Swedish CEO, Berit Behring, the bank’s head of wealth management. She will replace Jacob Aarup-Andersen, who will temporarily serve as CFO until Engels joins. After that, Aarup-Andersen will run Danske’s Danish operations.
Danske shares rose as much as 2.7% in Copenhagen trading, making it the best performer in the Bloomberg Europe Banks and Financial Services Index.
“It’s very obvious that Vogelzang is setting up his own team,” Mads Thinggaard, an analyst at ABG Sundal Collier, said. “That’s probably what is going to work best, looking at the challenges that Danske is facing.”
The bank also said that Chief Operating Officer Jim Ditmore will leave with a search for a replacement under way, as will Frederik Gjessing Vinten, the bank’s head of group development, whose job is being canceled.
Commerzbank said it was sorry to see Engels leave. As Commerzbank’s finance chief since 2012, he’d helped shape the lender’s new strategy, which included a pivot away from investment banking and toward servicing the retail clients and mid-sized corporate clients in its home market.
His departure is a setback for Commerzbank CEO Martin Zielke, who already had to give up most of his medium-term targets amid an economic slowdown in Europe’s largest economy and the prospect of lower interest rates.
“I deeply regret Stephan Engels’ decision, but understand his desire to embark on a new, international challenge,” Zielke said in a statement.
Before Commerzbank, he was head of finance & controlling at carmaker Mercedes-Benz and head of group controlling and reporting at  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn). Born in Hamburg, Engels studied economics at the University of St. Gallen in Switzerland.

656,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 05, 2019 04:39AM ET</span>","Nissan probe finds CEO Saikawa, other execs overpaid in compliance failure: source","By Maki Shiraki and Naomi Tajitsu
TOKYO (Reuters) - Nissan Motor Co was embroiled in another scandal over executive pay on Thursday after Chief Executive Hiroto Saikawa admitted to being overpaid in violation of internal procedures under a scheme designed by ousted Chairman Carlos Ghosn.
An internal investigation found that Saikawa and other executives had received improper compensation, a source with knowledge of the matter told Reuters, raising doubts about Saikawa's pledge to improve governance in the wake of Ghosn's arrest last year for alleged financial misconduct.
Saikawa apologized and vowed to return any improperly paid funds as he admitted to Japanese reporters earlier on Thursday that he had wrongly received stock-related compensation under ""a scheme of the Ghosn era"". 
""I am deeply sorry for causing concern,"" Saikawa said, according to Jiji Press.
In other comments reported by Kyodo news, Saikawa denied any direct role in the execution of a stock appreciation rights (SAR) scheme and said he thought ""proper procedures"" had been taken.
The improper payments, including tens of millions of yen Saikawa received through the SAR scheme, were disclosed on Wednesday at a meeting of Nissan's audit committee, said the source who declined to be identified because the information is not public.
Disciplinary action regarding the issue would be discussed at an upcoming board meeting, the source added.
Nissan said in a statement that the findings from its probe including issues related to the share appreciation rights would be submitted to its board on Sept. 9.
The company has been trying to strengthen governance, slash costs and boost flagging profitability amid persistent allegations of financial misconduct stemming from Ghosn's 20-year reign at Japan's second-biggest automaker.
Ghosn is awaiting trial in Japan over charges including enriching himself at a cost of $5 million to Nissan. Kyodo reported that proceedings could start as early as March.
He denies any wrongdoing and says he is the victim of a boardroom coup.
Confidence in Saikawa had already been shaken by accusations he was too close to Ghosn, whose arrest in November rocked the global auto industry and exposed tensions in the automaking partnership between Nissan and  Renault  SA (PA:RENA).
The company launched its internal investigation after Japanese magazine Bungei Shunju in June published accusations by former director Greg Kelly that Saikawa was granted an exception in 2013 to reschedule a stock-linked bonus that bumped up the payout by 47 million yen ($445,962).
Like Ghosn, Kelly is awaiting trial on charges of financial misconduct which he denies.
The latest compensation issue could exacerbate tensions with top shareholder Renault, after a failed attempt by the French automaker to secure a full merger with Nissan and to combine Renault with Fiat Chrysler (FCA). Saikawa opposed both plans.
Renault spokesman Frederic Texier declined to comment on the issue on Thursday. But a source close the company said Renault would ""respect Nissan's governance"" and leave the board to consider its response.
The alliance partners are discussing reforms that could win Nissan's support for a renewed FCA-Renault tie-up, including a potential reduction to Renault's 43.4% stake in Nissan.

Saikawa was re-appointed by shareholders with the lowest approval rating among the 11 directors in June.

Czech billionaire Daniel Kretinsky and partner Patrik Tkac acquired 4.6% of Casino, turning their attention to the troubled retailer after their effort to take over German wholesaler Metro AG was rebuffed. Casino shares surged as much as 6% in Paris trading.
Kretinsky and Tkac, who bought the stake via investment vehicle Vesa Equity, see opportunity in Casino’s business model. The two said in a statement Thursday that they believe the company to be “the distribution group best positioned on the French market and one of the European leaders best equipped to address the sector’s profound transformations.” They will get a seat on the board.
Casino’s Troubles
The move comes as Casino seeks to shore up its finances and reduce debt after a long fight with short sellers. Parent company Rallye SA is operating under French “safeguard” procedures that provide protection from creditors. Rallye is part of a string of indebted holding companies that allow Naouri to control the retailer. Its shares soared as much as 13% after the announcement.
Casino is caught between an ownership structure that’s forced it to pay high dividends to keep its parent afloat and a competitive French landscape in which it faces hard discounters such as Lidl and larger rivals such as  Carrefour  (PA:CARR) SA and E. Leclerc. In July, it canceled next year’s dividend as it accelerates its debt-reduction plans.
The new investors said they support Casino’s “omnichannel” strategy, under which it operates everything from suburban big-box outlets to downtown convenience stores while boosting its digital efforts. Its food-and-clothing stores under the Monoprix brand, which have a partnership with Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)., have outperformed the larger hypermarkets by attracting upmarket shoppers. Casino also has a deal with U.K. online grocer Ocado (LON:OCDO) Group Plc.
Financing Crunch
Casino said in August that it plans a new round of asset disposals that would raise an additional 2 billion euros ($2.2 billion), after a first phase of 2.5 billion euros worth of divestments. Casino has lost access to some short-term financing after S&P Global Ratings downgraded the company to five levels below investment grade in May.
Casino’s bonds due January 2023 gained 1.5 cents on the euro to 93 cents, rising to the highest level in more than three months, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Kretinsky, who has a net worth of at least $3 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, has built a portfolio that includes energy and media assets alongside the Sparta Prague soccer team. Last year, he acquired a stake in French daily Le Monde.
In June, he and Slovakian partner Tkac launched a 5.8 billion-euro bid to buy out Metro, but last month the offer fell short of the minimum shareholder acceptance threshold.
After the takeover attempt for Metro failed, Kretinsky said he would not purchase more shares in the German wholesaler for the time being while he awaits progress on Metro’s efforts to sell German big-box retail chain Real and a stake in its operations in China to focus on cash-and-carry outlets.

KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysia's biggest supermarket chain Mydin has removed products labeled palm-oil-free from its stores, its top executive said on Thursday, as part of a campaign by the world's second-largest producer of the oil to protect the commodity's image at home and abroad.
The $60 billion world palm oil trade has been the target of environmentalists because of the vast areas of tropical rainforest they say have been cleared to grow the commodity. The European Union this year passed an act to phase out palm oil from renewable fuel by 2030 due to the deforestation concerns.
Malaysia, which together with neighbor Indonesia produce about 85% of the world's palm, is considering a law banning all products flaunting non-use of the oil. Malaysia has also launched an international public relations and lobbying offensive to protect the reputation of its key export.
Ameer Ali Mydin, managing director of Mydin Mohamed Holdings Bhd [MYMHB.UL], said his stores removed all anti-palm products on Wednesday to convey the importance of palm oil to the Malaysian economy, Southeast Asia's third biggest.
""We must support palm oil but must also make sure (to counter) the subtle messages, the marketing and branding exercises that people do, to tell customers not to take palm oil,"" Ameer Ali told reporters at an event.
""By labeling something that there is no palm oil, you're actually telling people that palm oil is bad for you.""
He said the anti-palm products at his chain were imported, but declined to give any figures.
Teresa Kok, Malaysia's minister of primary industries, welcomed Mydin's move and told reporters she hoped other supermarkets and shops in the country would follow suit. In July, the Malaysian government promised action against an international school for spreading ""anti-palm oil propaganda"".
Indonesia, the world's top palm oil producer, last month told some retailers in the capital Jakarta to remove food products with ""palm oil-free"" labels from their shops.

Palm oil is used in cooking and in items like soaps and shampoo, snack foods, pizza, bread and biodiesel. Food accounts for nearly 70% of global consumption of palm oil.

China's Commerce Ministry said its trade team will consult with their U.S. counterparts in mid-September in preparation for negotiations in early October, and both sides agreed to take actions to create favorable conditions.
""We're in a market where investors are almost desperate for positive headlines and therefore this is having a buoyant effect,"" said Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at OANDA in London.
""Investors are hoping that we see a positive breakthrough, and the very least progress to another phase that could ultimately lead to a trade deal,"" Erlam said, but cautioned about expecting too much out of the talks.

Though the sentiment seemed to be risk-on with investors moving out of safe-haven assets such as Gold and Japanese Yen, broader worries lingered.
German industrial orders fell more than expected in July on weak demand from abroad, data showed on Thursday, suggesting that struggling manufacturers could tip Europe's biggest economy into a recession in the third quarter.
""Today's data is the first hard data for the third quarter and it doesn't bode well at all,"" Carsten Brzeski, Chief Economist at ING in Germany, wrote in a note.
""Since the start of the year, domestic orders have actually dropped more than foreign orders, suggesting that global woes have reached the domestic economy.""
However, Germany's trade-sensitive DAX (GDAXI) rose 0.64%.
Fears of a global recession triggered by the drawn-out trade war between the United States and China led markets to fall 1.6% in August, the biggest monthly drop since the sell-off in May.
Market participants will now be watching out for the European Central Bank meeting next week that is widely expected to lower interest rates, as policymakers seek to head off a slowdown caused by the protracted U.S.-China trade war.
France engine maker  Safran  (PA:SAF) jumped 7.20% after the company raised its full-year profit forecast, while Dassault Aviation (PA:AVMD) gained 8.23% after the maker of Rafale warplanes and Falcon business jets affirmed its view of higher net sales in 2019.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - General Motors (N:GM) Chief Executive Mary Barra will meet with U.S. President Donald Trump and White House officials on Thursday -- just days after GM came under attack from Trump, the White House confirmed late Wednesday.
Reuters reported earlier that the pair would discuss issues including trade, ongoing contract talks and revising vehicle fuel efficiency standards, citing three people briefed on the matter. The White House confirmed Trump would meet with Barra at 1:45 p.m. EDT in the Oval Office.
On Friday, Trump again criticized GM on Twitter saying the company ""which was once the Giant of Detroit, is now one of the smallest auto manufacturers there.""
GM declined to comment Wednesday on the meetings, which come as the largest U.S. automaker has had contentious relations with Trump over the last year.
Last week, Trump suggested GM should begin moving operations back to the United States from China. ""They moved major plants to China, BEFORE I CAME INTO OFFICE.... Now they should start moving back to America again?"" Trump said on Twitter.
GM did not directly comment on Trump's tweet last week but said its China operations ""are not a threat to U.S. jobs.""
Trump's ire with GM comes as contract talks between the United Auto Workers union and Detroit Three automakers intensify ahead of a Sept. 14 contract expiration. This week, the UAW selected GM as its initial target to reach a deal. 
GM's decision to close four plants in the United States is a central issue in the contract talks.
Trump has made boosting auto jobs a key priority and has often attacked automakers on Twitter for not doing enough to boost U.S. employment.
Trump has previously attacked GM for building vehicles in Mexico and for ending production at plants in Michigan, Ohio and Maryland. He has threatened to cut GM subsidies in retaliation and in June rejected a request to waive tariffs on Chinese-made Buick Envisions.
But Trump praised GM for entering talks to sell an idled northeast Ohio plant to a cash-strapped electric truck-building company.
Trump has also warned GM not to join  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) and three other automakers in backing a voluntary deal with California for stricter fuel economy standards than the Trump administration has proposed.

GM has not backed the agreement, arguing that it does not properly credit the company's electric vehicles. Even so, Trump tweeted last month the founders of Ford and GM were ""'rolling over' at the weakness of current car company executives"" in the face of fuel efficiency rules.

Chicago (Reuters) - Tesla Inc's (O:TSLA) use of individual customer data, such as vehicle camera footage and GPS, to price its new insurance products will depend on drivers' authorization and individual U.S. state laws, a senior company executive said on Wednesday.
""The data is there, it's all there, cameras in and all around your car, all of the data points are there,"" Matthew Edmonds, Tesla's Head of Insurance, said at an auto insurance conference in Chicago.
""It really comes down to case law, and how much of the data we can utilize. It would have to be a state-by-state proposition,"" Edmonds said.
Tesla last week said it was launching an insurance service designed to give drivers in California, its biggest market, lower rates because of safety features on its electric vehicles.
The company did not name an insurance partner, but the California Department of Insurance website showed Tesla was licensed as a broker to conduct business on behalf of the State National Insurance Company Inc, a unit of  Markel Corp  (N:MKL).
Chief Executive Elon Musk has been one of the strongest proponents of the idea that car insurance rates should plummet as driver-assist and self-driving technology become standard.
U.S. insurers say they currently do not have sufficient data to validate auto industry promises of safety benefits from automated driving systems, citing automakers' reluctance to provide detailed information on models sold with those features, a lack of consistent standards, drivers' unpredictable use of the systems and higher repair costs.
Tesla is one of the few manufacturers whose vehicles are largely standard-equipped with advanced driver assistance features, including cameras monitoring lane keeping and recording vehicle surroundings.
California regulatory insurance filings in May said Tesla's insurance product might use ""direct data feeds with customer permission.""
But Tesla's insurance website states it uses ""anonymized, aggregate data"" to inform insurance rates, adding that it does not currently use data from individual vehicles, such as GPS or video footage.
Edmonds on Wednesday said the company currently was not using much data beyond regular auto insurance pricing components, which include variables such as a driver's age, years of driving experience, safety record and annual mileage.
He declined to say when the company would consider using additional data to price insurance rates.
Asked what states Tesla would expand its insurance program to next, Edmonds said: ""Find the states where the population is, those will be the states we'll be going to."""
665,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 05, 2019 01:07AM ET</span>","Glencore's risk appetite dwindles, fueling focus on safer regions","By Ernest Scheyder and Barbara Lewis
(Reuters) -  Glencore  Inc's (L:GLEN) penchant for risk has long been mining industry lore, but the company is quickly expanding into a part of the world that would have been improbable just a few years ago: Minnesota. 
The Swiss-based commodity trader took majority control last June of PolyMet Mining Corp (TO:POM), which is developing a mine in the Midwest state near the Canadian border estimated to hold a century's worth of copper and nickel, critical to the development of electric vehicles. 
It is the first time that Glencore has controlled a major mining project in the United States, where President Donald Trump has cut mining regulations and red tape in a bid to encourage domestic mining, a marked change from predecessor Barack Obama, who favored stricter oversight of the sector and slowed or halted several large mining projects. 
Glencore for years has operated in regions considered high-risk, high-reward, making its shares a draw for some investors who saw the more conservative investing policies of peers, including BHP Group PLC (L:BHPB), as too tame. 
But displeasure from institutional investors and the electric vehicle industry with cobalt mining techniques and dangerous conditions has risen. In June, at least 41 illegal miners were killed at Glencore's Congo operations. 
In the last year, Glencore's shares have underperformed global peers BHP and  Rio Tinto  (L:RIO), which have largely avoided the fray in part by sticking with higher margin bulk commodities, including iron ore and coking coal, both ingredients for steel-making.
""It's hard to tell if Glencore is doing enough to mitigate risk, but they seem to be taking initiative,"" said David Neuhauser of Livermore Partners, which holds Glencore shares. 
Alongside Minnesota's PolyMet, Glencore has invested in Canada's  First Cobalt Corp  (V:FCC) to restart an Ontario refinery, started a new copper concentrates blending facility in Taiwan, and also is searching for non-Russian sources of aluminum, expressing an interest in buying Rio's operations in Iceland. 
Glencore has also held very early discussions about cobalt in Kazakhstan, industry sources said, talks that come after the company said it will halt output of the metal in Congo for at least two years. 
That's a sign that ""the (automakers) are paying more attention to the geography and reputation risk of their supply chain,"" forcing change at Glencore, said Frances Hudson of Aberdeen Standard, which holds the company's shares. 
A Glencore spokesman declined to comment for this article.
A BMO Capital Markets analyst earlier this week cut its price target on Glencore, citing in part uncertainty around the company's Congo operations. 
Glencore said last month that its profit in the first half of the year fell 32 percent due weakness in the company's cobalt operations and sliding prices for the metal, results that sent its shares to their lowest level since 2016.
To be sure, Glencore has operated for years in Australia and other countries considered safe havens for miners. 
The company inked a deal this year to supply cobalt to BMW (DE:BMWG), but only cobalt produced from its Murrin Murrin mine in Australia. 
IRON RANGE
Glencore took majority control of PolyMet in a debt-for-equity swap that boost its stake from about 30 percent of the smaller miner's shares to about 72 percent. That transaction made PolyMet debt-free. 
PolyMet earlier this year received the last of the permits it needs to begin construction of the open pit Northmet mine in the state's Iron Range, a rural region about 200 miles (322 km north of Minneapolis. Once operational, the mine is expected to produce 255 million tonnes of copper and nickel over the next century. 
A former steel mill near the deposit is being renovated to hold processing equipment. PolyMet had previously committed to providing all of its ore to Glencore. 
""PolyMet has potential and has the right zip code,"" said Neuhauser of Livermore Partners. 
PolyMet will remain the mine's developer and operator. The company plans to produce 310 million pounds of copper annually when fully operational, about 3 percent of the copper that Glencore produced in 2018.
Glencore is moving to incorporate PolyMet into its financial reporting and having it use Glencore's own auditor, Deloitte [DLTE.UL]. PolyMet had previously used PricewaterhouseCoopers. 
Glencore, which added its longtime executive Peter Freyberg to the PolyMet board, has also begun organizing meetings with potential financiers for the project, with PolyMet needing about $1 billion to develop Northmet. 
Operating in the United States does present its own set of challenges. The United Steelworkers union, which represents miners in the country, has given Glencore a ""silver medal"" in ""corporate irresponsibility"" due in part to what it has labeled tax evasion and anti union-intimidation. The union says it represents 850,000 workers in the United States, though it does not break that figure down by industry. 
The Minnesota Center for Environmental Advocacy said Glencore's safety record ""should concern every Minnesotan.""
PolyMet Chief Executive Jon Cherry said opponents to mining were putting up a ""false choice between environment and technology."" 

""These metals will be mined somewhere in the world,"" he told Reuters. ""The discussion should be around how you mine and making sure it's done responsibly.""

666,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 05, 2019 01:07AM ET</span>",Effort to disqualify lawyer part of U.S. campaign against Huawei: counsel,"By Karen Freifeld
(Reuters) - The effort to stop a former U.S. Justice Department official from representing Huawei is another step in a broader U.S. government campaign against the Chinese company, a lawyer for Huawei argued on Wednesday.
Lawyer Michael Levy said the company has not been given any material information as to why its counsel, James Cole, should be removed.
Cole is Huawei’s lead lawyer in the U.S. case against the world's largest telecommunications equipment maker for allegedly misleading global banks about its business in Iran. 
U.S. prosecutors have asked the judge in the case to disqualify Cole, claiming his work as the No. 2 official in the Justice Department created ""irresolvable conflicts of interest.” Prosecutors say Cole, who served as former deputy attorney general until 2015, had access to confidential information that he could use against the government. 
In oral arguments in Brooklyn federal court, Levy told U.S. District Court Judge Ann Donnelly that the decision to try to disqualify Cole was part of a ""barrage"" against the company that also includes a separate Justice Department case alleging trade secret theft and a decision to place Huawei on a Commerce Department blacklist that bans most U.S. sales to the firm.
""This case is quite clearly part of an overall agenda by the government against Huawei,"" Levy argued. The move to disqualify Cole, Levy said, ""can be seen as one more tactical step."" 
Assistant U.S. Attorney David Kessler told the judge the matter related to “a single criminal case,” and that Huawei had numerous other lawyers.
Much of the government’s argument is confidential and classified. Prosecutors say Cole supervised and participated in aspects of an investigation related to the Huawei case which has not been made public. 
""The ultimate question is whether Mr. Cole has the government's confidences,"" Kessler said. ""We don’t think it’s a close call.”
Cole claims he has no recollection of matters referenced as the basis for him to be disqualified from the case, according to another court filing. He served as deputy attorney general until 2015, and he has represented Huawei for at least two years. 
On Wednesday, Cole said he would make his case to the judge after she closed her courtroom to the public because of the classified information involved.
The judge did not indicate when she would rule on whether to disqualify Cole, and set the next court hearing for December 12.
The case against Huawei is proceeding as Beijing and Washington engage in an escalating trade war.
It also is taking place as the United States has pressured other countries to drop Huawei from their cellular networks, worried its equipment could be used by Beijing for spying, which the company says are unfounded. 
Huawei's chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, the daughter of Huawei's founder, was arrested in Canada in December at the request of the United States in connection with the case. 
Meng and others are accused of conspiring to defraud HSBC and other banks by misrepresenting Huawei’s relationship with a company that operated in Iran, putting them at risk of violating U.S. sanctions. 
Meng has said she is innocent and is fighting extradition. 

Cole entered a not guilty plea on behalf of Huawei and its U.S. subsidiary in Brooklyn in March.

667,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 05, 2019 12:32AM ET</span>",Billionaire Birla’s Deal to Buy Aleris Faces U.S. Hurdle,"(Bloomberg) -- Indian billionaire Kumar Mangalam Birla’s Hindalco Industries Ltd. faces another regulatory hurdle for its $2.6 billion proposed purchase of U.S. aluminum parts maker Aleris Corp., this time from Washington.
The Justice Department filed a civil antitrust lawsuit seeking to block the purchase by Hindalco’s U.S. unit Novelis Corp. The case cited the need to preserve competition in the North American market for rolled aluminum sheet for automotive applications. The deal also faced antitrust objections in the European Commission earlier this year.
The transaction if allowed to proceed, would enable Novelis to lock up 60% of projected total U.S. automotive body sheet capacity and the vast majority of uncommitted capacity, enabling the company to raise prices, reduce innovation and provide less favorable terms of service to the detriment of automakers and ultimately American consumers, the U.S. said.
The lawsuit ignores the competition from steel, which has almost 90% share of the automotive body sheet market, Novelis said in a statement Wednesday. The case isn’t expected to impede the closing of the deal by Jan. 21, “even if a remedy is required to address the DOJ’s competitive concerns,“ it said.
“Automakers increasingly need aluminum auto body sheet to satisfy American consumers’ demand for larger vehicles that are lighter and more fuel-efficient,” Makan Delrahim, the head of the Justice Department’s antitrust division, said in a statement. “The loss of a competing supplier of aluminum auto body sheet ultimately would harm American car buyers.”
Hindalco offered some antitrust commitments to the European Commission to gain regulatory approval for the deal, according to information on commission’s website posted last month. The deadline for taking a final decision on the deal is Oct. 7, the commission said.
“Our merger with Aleris threatens no one, and to the contrary will strengthen our ability to compete against steel, meet growing customer demand for aluminum, achieve our recycling goals, and bolster our sustainability platform worldwide,” Steve Fisher, Novelis CEO said in an emailed statement, referring to the DOJ case.
Shares of Hindalco in Mumbai rose as much as 3.9%, the most in five months, before paring gains to trade 1.5% higher at 184.35 rupees ($2.56) as of 9.40 a.m. local time.
Novelis is the second Aleris suitor that faced regulatory scrutiny in the U.S. for the purchase of the Cleveland-based aluminum maker. In 2017, Aleris agreed to terminate its merger with Zhongwang USA LLC, owned by billionaire Liu Zhongtian, after failing to get approval to proceed from American regulators.
“The transaction remains subject to other customary closing conditions, including receipt of regulatory approvals in Europe and China,” Sean Stack, Aleris chairman and CEO said in a separate emailed statement. “We are pleased that the parties and DOJ have agreed on a process and timetable for resolving the dispute that will permit the transaction to close by January 21, 2020, the contractual end date under the merger agreement. We continue to believe that this acquisition will be extremely positive for Aleris customers, employees and shareholders.”

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) on Wednesday cited driver errors and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc's Autopilot design as the probable cause of a January 2018 crash of a Model S into a parked fire truck on a highway in California.
The safety board, which previously criticized Tesla's driver assistance system Autopilot after a 2016 fatal crash in Florida, said that the system's design ""permitted the driver to disengage from the driving task"" in the Culver City, California, crash. The NTSB said on Tuesday that Autopilot allowed the driver to keep his hands off the wheel for the vast majority of the nearly 14 minutes of the trip.
The fire truck was unoccupied and the driver was not injured in the incident. The NTSB cited the driver's ""inattention and overreliance"" on the advanced driver assistance system.
Tesla's Autopilot was engaged during at least three fatal U.S. crashes, including one involving a 2018 Model 3 in Delray Beach, Florida, and a crash in Mountain View, California, of a Model X. Both incidents, which occurred in March 2018, remain under investigation by the NTSB and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). The NTSB makes safety recommendations, while the NHTSA can order a recall if it deems a defect poses an unreasonable risk to safety.
The Center for Auto Safety, a consumer watchdog group, said on Wednesday the NTSB report should prompt NHTSA to ""do its job and recall these vehicles ... A vehicle that enables a driver to not pay attention, or fall asleep, while accelerating into a parked fire truck is defective and dangerous.""
NHTSA did not immediately comment.
Tesla said in an emailed statement that since the 2018 crash ""we have made updates to our system including adjusting the time intervals between hands-on warnings and the conditions under which they’re activated.""
The company added that Tesla owners have driven billions of miles with Autopilot engaged and says its data ""indicates that drivers using Autopilot remain safer than those operating without assistance.""
The crashes raised questions about the driver-assistance
system’s ability to detect hazards and sparked safety concerns about systems that can perform driving tasks for extended stretches of time with little or no human intervention, but which cannot completely replace human drivers.
After the fatal 2016 Florida crash, NTSB asked six automakers with advanced driver assistance systems - Tesla, Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p), BMW AG, Nissan Motor Co,  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn) and Volvo Car - to ""develop applications to more effectively sense the driver's level of engagement and alert the driver when engagement is lacking while automated vehicle control systems are in use.""
""All manufacturers except Tesla have responded to the NTSB explaining their current systems and their efforts to reduce misuse and keep drivers engaged,"" the NTSB said.
While Tesla drivers say they are able to avoid holding the steering wheel for extended periods while using Autopilot, Tesla advises drivers to keep their hands on the wheel and pay attention while using the system.
The 2014 Model S Autopilot system was engaged continuously for the final 13 minutes 48 seconds of the January 2018 trip and the driver kept his hands off the wheel for all but 51 seconds of the final drive segment and received numerous alerts to place his hands back on the wheel, the NTSB said. Had he been paying close attention ""he could have taken evasive action to avoid or mitigate the collision."""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - New York City sued T-Mobile USA Inc on Wednesday, accusing the fourth-largest U.S. mobile phone company of engaging in ""rampant"" sales abuses of customers for its lower-priced, prepaid wireless brand, Metro by T-Mobile.
In a complaint filed in the state supreme court in Manhattan, the city said it had identified more than 2,200 violations by T-Mobile, whose ""pervasive"" illegal activity spanned 56 Metro stores in all five boroughs, including authorized dealers and stores run by its MetroPCS NY unit.
T-Mobile, a unit of Deutsche Telekom AG (DE:DTEGn), declined immediate comment.
Spokespeople for the city's law department and Consumer Affairs Commissioner Lorelei Salas did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The lawsuit was filed as T-Mobile tries to win necessary approvals to merge with Sprint Corp, the No. 3 U.S. mobile phone company.
Sixteen U.S. states, led by New York and California, and Washington, D.C. have sued to block the merger, which they say will boost costs for consumers by reducing competition.
In its complaint, New York City said it had evidence that many Metro stores sold used or reconditioned phones as new, and charged taxes that were excessive or appeared to be ""made up,"" including ""device change taxes"" and ""device activation taxes.""
It also accused T-Mobile of partnering with third parties to enroll unsuspecting consumers in expensive financing plans without their consent.
The complaint cited one example in which a woman thought she had bought a phone advertised at $599 from a Bronx dealer, only to learn later that she had signed up for a 12-month lease costing $2,191.30.
New York City also said the website of Metro by T-Mobile deceptively advertised a ""30 day guarantee"" on phone purchases, though the fine print said the guarantee was just seven days and covered only a ""small sub-category"" of transactions.
The lawsuit seeks to recoup overcharges, and impose civil fines of $350 to $500 per violation, among other remedies.

The case is City of New York et al v T-Mobile USA et al, New York State Supreme Court, New York County, No. 451540/2019.

A full-page advertisement attributed to the government appeared in Thursday’s edition of the Australian Financial Review, a publication aimed at the business community.
“You have read a lot, seen a lot, heard a lot about the events and protests in Hong Kong,” it starts. “But what you read, see, hear -- or ‘share’ on social media -- is just one piece of a complex social, economic and political jigsaw puzzle. It is a puzzle that we will solve on our own. And, it may take time.”
The ad points out that Hong Kong’s government is committed to “One Country, Two Systems”, has a tradition of peaceful protest, but rejects the use of violence.
“Despite recent disruptions, the fundamentals and institutional underpinning of our economy and society are strong,” the advertisement reads. “We remain a safe, open, welcoming and cosmopolitan society and an internationally connected, vibrant and dynamic economy. We will no doubt bounce back. We always do.”
Hong Kong has been gripped by the worst unrest since the former colony’s return to Chinese rule in 1997, sparked by proposed legislation to allow extraditions to mainland China. Protests have disrupted the global financial hub’s streets, subways and airport, resulting in more than 1,100 arrests. In a bid to quell three months of violence, the city’s Chief Executive Carrie Lam on Wednesday formally withdrew the extradition bill.
Australia hosts a large Chinese diaspora, which has become engaged in the debate over Hong Kong’s future. Rallies have been held in major cities such as Sydney and Melbourne as well as on university campuses, with tensions high between supporters of the mainland government and pro-Hong Kong democracy campaigners who have taken out their own newspaper ads in recent weeks."

The measure is another sign of how U.S. sanctions are affecting the functioning of Venezuelan state institutions.
But the practical impact is limited because the bank is small and hyperinflation has reduced use of credit cards, whose credit limits rarely keep up with price increases.
""The Bank of the Armed Forces denounces to its civilian and military clients ... the suspension of interbank services for its credit cards on the part of the American company Mastercard,"" the bank said in a statement posted on Twitter.
The U.S. Treasury Department in March told Visa (NYSE:V), Mastercard and  American Express  (NYSE:AXP) that they could not continue doing business with Venezuelan state institutions after March 2020.
That was part of a broad set of sanctions against Venezuela's government that is meant to push Maduro from office and support opposition leader Juan Guaido, who in January invoked the constitution to assume a rival interim presidency.
Commerce in Venezuela's collapsing economy depends heavily on debit card transactions, which operate principally on a local platform, and increasingly on dollars and euros in cash.
Venezuelan bank regulator Sudeban earlier this year asked local banks to design a new payment system, according to a financial sector source, who added the project has not been completed.
""#Mastercard should know that its arbitrary action will not intimidate us,"" Bank of the Armed Forces President Dario Baute wrote via Twitter. ""The @BanFANB technology team is stronger than you think and our legal team will respond with the same force with which you attacked us.""
Mastercard, Venezuela's Information Ministry and the Bank of the Armed Forces did not respond to requests for comment.
Mastercard also halted services to state-run Agricultural Bank. Phone numbers published on that bank's website were disconnected."

677,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 04, 2019 08:38PM ET</span>","Exclusive: In U-turn, Ford ditches plan to unify China sales system after partners push back","By Norihiko Shirouzu and Ben Klayman
SHANGHAI/DETROIT (Reuters) - Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co has scrapped a plan to create a unified national sales company for China that stoked mistrust of the automaker at its joint venture partners and contributed to a spectacular collapse in sales in the world's biggest car market.
On the face of it, the plan announced by Ford in June last year to combine sales channels for vehicles manufactured with Chongqing Changan Automobile Co and Jiangling Motors Group made sense. It would promote operational efficiency at its loss-making China operations and is standard practice in most other markets.
But it ignored realities on the ground. Chinese automakers, often in 50-50 partnerships with foreign car makers, are reluctant to lose control over sales decisions, rarely willing to trust each other and loyal to local provinces that are fiercely competitive in their quest for economic growth and tax revenues from vehicle sales.
""I would say there was a lack of deep understanding on how relationships work in China,"" Anning Chen, who in October took over as Ford's third China chief in two years, said in an interview in Shanghai. 
It is the first time that Ford, grappling with a host of problems in China that present no quick fix, has disclosed the dropping of the plan - a decision also prompted by a sharp slowdown in China's economic growth amid the trade war with the United States as well as deeper losses at dealerships.
Many major foreign automakers have 2 or 3 partners in China, involving different marketing and distribution strategies for each partner. Ford is the only one known to have tried combining sales channels for mainstream cars.
Other steps Ford is taking to turn around its China business include launching 30 new or significantly redesigned vehicles over the next three years, reductions in the number of temporary workers at plants, hiring more local Chinese, and putting profits before growth in market share.
Capacity cuts as Ford and its partners embark on ""right-sizing"" their plants are also likely, Chen said.
A recovery would help relieve pressure on the U.S. automaker which is also scrambling to end losses in Europe through plant closures and layoffs. It would also mitigate the risk that Ford ends up a marginal player in China - a market with annual sales of some 28 million vehicles that many foreign automakers now consider their most important.
SALES IMPLOSION
The slide in Ford's sales has been unprecedented for a major global automaker in China. After a peak of 1.08 million vehicles in 2016, sales began faltering in late 2017, then nearly halved last year to 504,488, according to consultancy IHS Markit.
IHS forecasts Ford's sales will tumble further to 382,882 this year, while LMC Automotive predicts Ford's China market share will fall to 1.4% compared to 3.8% in 2016.
GRAPHIC: Ford's China sales collapse - https://graphics.reuters.com/FORD-MOTOR-CHINA/0100B273150/FORD-CHINA.jpg
Ford has publicly pinned the blame on an aging model lineup but company officials familiar with the matter said the breakdown in relationships with its joint venture partners and dealers as well as missteps by previous management teams were the bigger factors at play.
For now, Ford's main goal in China is profitability, Joe Hinrichs, president of Ford Automotive, told Reuters at the company's Dearborn, Michigan headquarters. 
""You can be a profitable business in China with a relatively low market share because of...the size of the market,"" he said.
As signs of progress, Hinrichs pointed to dealer inventories at their lowest level in 18 months and a halving in first-half China losses before interest and tax to $283 million from the same period a year earlier. 
""This is not a five-year journey,"" he said, but declined to be more specific when asked how soon Ford's China unit is expected to regain profitability.
Hinrichs, who became head of Ford's auto business in May, helmed its Asia Pacific business from 2009 to 2011 - a period of strong growth for the automaker in China.
Chen, a U.S. citizen who grew up in China and speaks fluent Mandarin, joined Ford in October from Chery Automobile Co. He is however, a Ford veteran, having worked for the firm for 17 years, mostly in Dearborn, prior to joining Chery.
TERRITORIAL ABOUT TERRITORY 
Highlighting the uneasy relationship that the joint venture partners have with each other and with Ford has been unhappiness over a cross distribution arrangement for a small sport-utility vehicle, the Territory. It was developed with JMC and sold not only through JMC Ford's sales network but also through Changan Ford's.
The approach angered Changan, which wondered why it wasn't the development partner and which as a bigger state-owned company considers itself far higher in pecking order than a regional firm like JMC, Ford company officials said.
For its part, JMC was upset the product was shared with Changan, the officials added, declining to be identified as they were not authorised to speak publicly on the matter.
Changan Ford, which makes the Ford EcoSport SUV, Focus small car and Mondeo sedan, did not respond to a request for comment. JMC, which builds the Territory and the Transit and Tourneo vans, declined to comment.
While Ford previously touted the arrangement as a success, Chen was more circumspect, saying similar agreements were unlikely as they can create inconsistencies in dealer services.
""We want to make sure distribution networks are directly facing different market segments and customers. We don't want to mix them up,"" he said.
Ford is also aiming to build more cars locally, which will improve relations with domestic partners and help fill its woefully underused assembly plants. Cars likely to be built in China include the redesigned Ford Explorer and Lincoln Aviator SUVs.
Ford used only 24% of its China production capacity to build 1.6 million vehicles in 2018, according to U.S. consultancy AlixPartners. Normally, rates of around 70% to 75% are considered the breakeven threshold. Ford declined to comment on its China capacity.
PSA Group, also struggling in China with a 26% capacity utilization rate in 2018 according to AlixPartners, is shutting one plant, selling another and cutting thousands of jobs.
Hinrichs said, however, that Ford doesn't feel a ""huge amount of pressure"" to shutter any of its five China plants given that they are already paid for. 

Instead, by locally producing many of the upcoming new products, Ford will gain an opportunity to further adjust the installed capacity, he said.

678,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 04, 2019 07:50PM ET</span>","Slack forecasts bigger third-quarter loss, slowing revenue growth; shares tumble","By Arjun Panchadar
(Reuters) -  Slack Technologies Inc  (N:WORK) forecast slowing revenue growth in the second half and a bigger-than-expected third-quarter loss in its first report as a public company on Wednesday, as it faces intense competition from  Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT) and others.
Shares of the workplace messaging platform tumbled 13% in extended trading. Up to Wednesday's close, they had lost 19.3% from their debut price of $38.50 in June.
Analysts have indicated their skepticism over the company's ability to turn a profit after its warning earlier in the year, something that has hurt high-profile technology stocks like  Uber Technologies Inc  (N:UBER) and  Lyft  Inc (O:LYFT) that went public before Slack.
The company forecast a third-quarter loss of 8 to 9 cents a share. Analysts on average were expecting a loss of 7 cents per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. 
It also forecast revenue in the range of $154 million to $156 million, representing growth of 46% to 48%, which is slower than the 58% this quarter and the 67% increase in the first quarter.
Slack topped second-quarter revenue expectations, however, and posted a smaller-than-expected loss for the quarter ended July 31. The company posted revenue of $145 million, beating estimates of $141.3 million.
It said revenue was hit by $8.2 million of credits related to a service disruption in the quarter.
""I imagine the reaction is picking on the year-over-year revenue growth deceleration from Q1 to Q2. Slack did have an outage in Q2, which led to $8.2 million in credits … adjusted for this factor, growth would have been 66% Y/Y, which is a solid trend,"" D.A. Davidson analyst Rishi Jaluria said.
EXPENSES SOAR
Slack competes with Microsoft Teams, a chat add-on for Microsoft Office365 users. Other similar platforms include Workplace by  Facebook Inc  (O:FB) and Cisco Systems Inc's (O:CSCO) Webex Teams.
Microsoft disclosed in July it had over 13 million daily active users, above Slack's more than 10 million.
Slack's total operating expenses in the quarter skyrocketed 317.6% to $477.5 million. It said sales and marketing expenses were expected to accelerate in the second half and exceed 50% of revenue.
Slack went public via a direct listing on June 20, instead of the more popular initial public offering route. Its shares soared nearly 50% in their public trading debut, valuing it at more than $23 billion.
It said it had over 100,000 paid customers at the end of the quarter.
The company also said it was seeing great traction in its ""shared channels"" feature, which is currently in beta and will be available to all Slack customers later this month.
Slack's adjusted second-quarter loss of 14 cents per share was smaller than the 18 cents analysts had expected. Slack also raised its full-year revenue forecast and now expects its loss for the year to be smaller.

Slack said net loss attributable to common stockholders ballooned to $359.6 million, or 98 cents per share, in the second quarter, from $31.9 million, or 26 cents per share, a year earlier, primarily because of $307 million of stock-based compensation.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Activist hedge fund Jana Partners on Friday disclosed a large new stake in Outback Steakhouse owner Bloomin' Brands Inc , returning for the second time in nearly two years to push for fresh changes after reaching a settlement in 2018.
Jana, one of the industry's most powerful activist hedge funds, said in a regulatory filing that it owns 9%, or 7.8 million shares, and plans to discuss strategic alternatives with management. These might include a sale of the company, spinning off pieces of the company, changing the way it spends money and who sits on its board.
Jana Partners could not be reached for comment.
Bloomin' Brands did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.
Bloomin' Brands stock price jumped 6.3% to trade at $17.82, erasing all of this year's losses, after Jana made its filing. When Jana disclosed its first meaningful stake in the company, in November 2017, the stock price surged 12% to trade at $20.54.
The company and the activist hedge fund quickly reached a settlement in February 2018 and agreed to add an independent director to its eight member board. Wendy Beck, a former chief financial officer at Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd, still sits on the board. 
Jana, which prefers to stay out of the limelight, quietly took profits on its position as management declared the company had turned a corner. By the end of the second quarter 2018, Jana no longer listed the stock as a position on its regulatory filing.
But an increase in stock sales by company insiders coupled with a sinking stock price prompted Jana to return a second time, something it generally does not do, a person familiar with the fund's investments said.
Jana Partners, run by Barry Rosenstein, has scored big wins including pushing for changes at Whole Food Market that prompted the grocer to sell itself to Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN).
Bloomin' Brands faced two activists two years ago. Barington Capital called for a spinoff of three smaller restaurant chains -- Bonefish Grill, Carrabba's and Fleming's -- to be separated into a new company and for Outback to be run independently. It also asked for changes on the board and said costs were too high.

Earlier this year, as Jana Partners was building its Bloomin' Brands stake anew, Barington cut its position by more than 75%, a filing shows.

ZURICH (Reuters) - Switzerland's biggest bank UBS on Thursday appointed former  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) manager Iqbal Khan to co-lead its flagship wealth management business, as part of a broader shake-up of its executive board.
The appointment of Khan alongside two internal promotions mark a significant revamp for the bank as it seeks fresh talent for its CEO succession planning efforts and drums up enthusiasm for its core business in an increasingly challenging landscape.
Khan, a former head of Credit Suisse International Wealth Management and a rising star considered a CEO candidate in the future, will replace Martin Blessing as UBS wealth management co-head alongside U.S. counterpart Tom Naratil. 
Suni Harford, a  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) veteran who joined UBS in 2017, was promoted from her current role as head of investment at the asset management business to leading the entire division. She replaces Uelrich Koerner.
""I'm looking forward to having Suni and Iqbal join the Group Executive Board,"" Chief Executive Sergio Ermotti said in a statement. ""They are great additions to the team and will help us drive sustainable growth and profitability for UBS.""
In addition, Chief Operating Officer Sabine Keller-Busse will take on the additional role of president of the Europe, Middle East and Africa region from Koerner. 
After benefiting from a shift to the traditionally steady wealth management business years ahead of rival Credit Suisse, UBS has been hit by a slew of troubles in recent years.
They range from cash hoarding by wealthy clients to a multi-billion euro legal fight in France, prompting questions on whether it might need to refresh its strategy as banks come under pressure from geopolitical turmoil and low interest rates.
With Ermotti in the CEO role since 2011 and Chairman Axel Weber leading the non-executive board since 2012, speculation over succession planning has been on the rise.
The appointment of Khan, 43, should take pressure off management to present a long-term prospect. Keller-Busse and Naratil are also seen as candidates for the role. 
PROVEN RECORD
Khan quit Credit Suisse in July ""to pursue other opportunities"", with sources saying he was mulling roles at UBS, Julius Baer and a U.S. bank, with the long-term goal of procuring a top job as CEO.
Under Khan, Credit Suisse's newly created International Wealth Management unit boosted profitability and revenues as Switzerland's second-biggest bank underwent a major overhaul, whittling down its investment bank and refashioning itself as a bank for wealthy entrepreneurs.
""We welcome the appointments of Iqbal Khan and Suni Harford (effective 1 October 2019) and believe the market will take the rejuvenation of UBS's Group Executive Board well,"" Vontobel analyst Andreas Venditti wrote in a note. 
""Iqbal Khan clearly has a strong track record, boosting Credit Suisse International Wealth Management's adjusted pre-tax profit by almost 80% in 3 years."" 
UBS stock rose 1.4% by 0840 GMT while the European bank sector index gained 0.9%.

Blessing, a former Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) head who joined UBS in 2016, will remain with the bank through December, while asset management head Koerner will become an adviser to Ermotti through at least March.

682,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 04, 2019 06:44PM ET</span>",Catastrophes set to drive 2020 reinsurance rates higher,"By Carolyn Cohn and Lena Masri
LONDON (Reuters) - Big insurance losses from hurricanes, wildfires and other natural disasters over the past two years are set to push reinsurance renewal rates higher in January, ratings agencies said.
After falling for several years due to competition and fewer natural disasters, renewal rates have started to climb in the past couple of years and for 2020 are set to rise on average by as much as 5%.
However, as Hurricane Dorian ravages the Bahamas and bears down on the United States, Fitch, Moody's and S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) said some rates could jump by much more than that.
S&P said rates would likely rise by around 5%, Moody's expected rises of 0-5%, while Fitch predicted 1-2%, in briefings ahead of the reinsurance industry's annual conference in Monte Carlo which begins on Saturday.
Reinsurers such as  Swiss Re  (S:SRENH), Munich Re (DE:MUVGn) and the Lloyd’s of London market help insurers share the risks of disasters in return for part of the premium.
""It's not a hard market but it's a hardening market, there's more positive momentum,"" Ali Karakuyu, lead analyst at S&P Global, told a media briefing.
Fellow analyst David Masters said the industry was likely to see ""mid-single digit price increases"" as a result.
Insurers are increasingly concerned about the impact of bad weather linked to climate change, with an increase in wildfires in California among the most costly in recent years, something S&P said could see rates there jump 30-70%.
""This market remains in disarray, which will fuel further rate increases,"" a slide from the S&P presentation said.
Analysts at UBS estimated that the reinsurance industry is in an excess capital position of around $30 billion, but that an estimated $70 billion of natural catastrophe losses in 2019 could erode this excess capital.
Moody's analysts said lines of business that have been performing badly over the last few years, for example due to losses related to hurricanes in the United States, would see price rises in the mid-teens.

Fitch Senior Director Graham Coutts said he expected average rates to rise 1-2%, similar to the increases seen in January 2019, although further rises could be seen depending on the scale of losses from Dorian and other hurricanes.

The bank's ""Bull & Bear"" gauge of market sentiment has dropped to 1.3, down from 2.4 a week ago, triggering a ""buy signal"" for risk assets, the bank's strategists said.
The bank said it is more bullish this year on stocks and commodities after huge outflows of investor cash from those markets and also because central banks were loosening monetary policy in response.
""Trade war thus far caused lower rates, not recession,"" the strategists, led by Michael Hartnett, said in the report. 
The call comes as investors continue to sell equities and buy bonds and gold, which are considered safe during times of economic and political strife, amid worries over trade tensions and a global economic slowdown.
Some $12.4 billion of cash flowed into bond funds and $1.9 billion into gold in the week to Wednesday, the bank said, citing EPFR data. Another $7.6 billion left equities, taking the year-to-date outflow total to $204 billion, it said. 
A record $160 billion of inflows into bond funds over the past three months reveals deep global recession fears, the strategists said. They said Europe looks increasingly like Japan, which is still struggling with low inflation after the slump caused by a burst asset bubble in the early 1990s.
Europe's major stocks indices reached one-months highs on Friday, amid hopes that trade tensions between Washington and Beijing were easing, although the latest batch of punitive import tariffs were due to hit Chinese goods on Sunday.

Both Greenlight Capital Re and Third Point Reinsurance, linked to David Einhorn's Greenlight Capital and Dan Loeb's Third Point respectively, ""trade well below book value and look appealing"", the U.S. financial newspaper said.
Supporting its view for Greenlight Capital Re was a possible sale of the company which could come out of an ongoing strategic review of the business, while Third Point Re ""may be poised for a comeback,"" it said.
The reinsurance sector has suffered in recent years from falling product pricing, fueled by large amounts of capital coming into the space, and increased natural disaster payouts.
However, the newspaper noted that better rates and terms for reinsurers, as well as improved returns from investments, were helping such firms.
Barron's cautioned that natural disasters could undermine its thesis on both companies, in particular Third Point Re, which it said had expanded its catastrophe reinsurance business this year and has exposure to Florida.
Hurricane Dorian, the second-strongest Atlantic storm on record that crashed into the Bahamas on Sunday, could still make landfall in the Sunshine State in the coming days, according to the National Hurricane Center. Even without a direct hit, Dorian could still cause significant damage to Florida through high winds, torrential rain and storm surges.
Both Greenlight Capital Re and Third Point Reinsurance didn't immediately respond to separate requests for comment.

(Reuters) - Driver Management Company LLC, an activist investor focused on U.S. banks, renewed calls on Wednesday for  First United Corp  (O:FUNC), the holding company for Maryland community bank First United Bank & Trust, to sell itself.
First United's shares have traded at a significant discount to its regional banking peers, and the company has fallen behind its competitors in making new loans, according to a letter Driver sent to the bank's board of directors.
Directors on the bank's board have also stuck around too long, with an average tenure of nearly 15 years, Driver argued in the letter.
""Some members have been on the board 25 years,"" Driver founder Abbott Cooper said in an interview. ""It's a fun club, there's a lot of prestige being a director at a bank in a small community. But, no one is (saying) 'Hey, what's going on with the stock?' They have all the perks of being a public company without responsibility.""
First United Bank did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Ahead of the bank's annual meeting earlier this year, Driver had also called for it to sell itself. Driver had a much smaller stake in First United at that time. It is now the bank's third largest shareholder with a more than 5% stake.
Driver has had meetings with First United's board over the past several months but found it was not receptive to its suggestions, according to the letter. The investor thinks the bank's shares, now trading around $21, could fetch $26 to $33 in a sale, according to the letter.
Cooper said in the interview that without significant changes to its business, First United was unlikely to reach that valuation absent a sale.
The activist is urging that First United hire financial advisers to help the bank find a buyer."

The company has hired law firm Latham & Watkins LLP and consulting firm AlixPartners LLP to advise on the matter, Bloomberg reported, citing people with knowledge of the situation. 
Mallinckrodt, which has a market value of about $218 million, declined to comment on the report.
The development comes as opioid makers in the United States, including Mallinckrodt, face pressure from a crackdown on the addictive drug in the wake of the opioid crisis and as state attorneys general file lawsuits against manufacturers.
If the legal liabilities aren’t manageable, Mallinckrodt may choose to seek bankruptcy protection, the Bloomberg report said.
Mallinckrodt last month suspended plans to spin-off its specialty generics unit, citing opioid litigation uncertainties.
Up to Wednesday's close, the stock had fallen 84%.
The slump in the stock means big gains for short sellers, who have bet heavily against the drugmaker in recent months.
As of Tuesday, short bets against Mallinckrodt stood at about $113 million, equivalent to 54% of its float, up from 43% in early June, according to S3 Partners, a financial analytics firm.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A federal judge reviewing a Justice Department decision to allow U.S. pharmacy chain and benefits manager CVS Health Corp (N:CVS) to merge with health insurer Aetna (NYSE:AET) said on Wednesday that the agreement was in fact legal under antitrust law.
Judge Richard Leon of U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia had been examining a government plan announced in October to allow the merger on condition that Aetna sell its Medicare prescription drug plan business to WellCare Health Plans Inc (N:WCG). Both deals have already closed.
Leon had initially balked at approving the merger conditions and insisted on hearing from critics of the deal, but finally decided to grant the motion to approve the consent agreement.
But he took aim at the common practice of companies' closing multibillion-dollar deals while the court review, required by the Tunney Act, was still in process.
""If the Tunney Act is to mean anything,"" Leon wrote, ""it surely must mean that no court should rubberstamp a consent decree approving the merger of 'one of the largest companies in the United States' and 'the nation's third largest health-insurance company,' ... simply because the Government requests it!""
In December, Leon said he was ""less convinced"" than the government that the asset sale to WellCare would resolve antitrust concerns. Since then,  Centene  Corp (N:CNC) agreed to acquire WellCare for $15.27 billion.
Assistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim, head of the Justice Department’s Antitrust Division, said he was pleased with Leon's decision.
CVS said the judge's decision reinforced that CVS and Aetna have already merged.
""CVS Health and Aetna have been one company since November 2018, and today’s action by the District Court makes that 100 percent clear. We remain focused on transforming the consumer health care experience in America,"" CVS spokesman T.J. Crawford said in an emailed statement.
Critics of the CVS-Aetna deal included the American Medical Association and the AIDS Healthcare Foundation.
Another critic, U.S. PIRG, expressed skepticism that savings from the merger would end up in consumers' pockets.
""Again and again, CVS Caremark has used its market power to both increase the cost of medications for consumers and rip off the government, instead of passing on savings its promised to consumers,"" PIRG said in a statement. 
Pending Leon's approval, CVS agreed to temporarily allow Aetna to independently make critical product, pricing and personnel decisions.
CVS has been in the process of converting itself into a healthcare company and said in June that it would offer expanded health services such as nutrition counseling and blood pressure screenings in 1,500 stores by the end of 2021.
Most consent agreements that the antitrust agencies strike with companies to resolve competitive concerns are approved by federal courts with little fuss under the 1974 Tunney Act, which requires courts to ensure the agreements are in the public interest.

Companies generally do not wait for final court approval before closing their transactions.

Novelis, which is U.S.-based but owned by India's  Hindalco Industries  (NS:HALC), said in a statement that it remained determined to close the deal by Jan. 21, the outside date for the merger agreement.
The company also said the Justice Department failed to understand that the market was bigger than just aluminum and that aluminum competed with steel.
The deal was announced in July 2018. Aleris had previously struck a deal to be purchased by Zhongwang USA, an investment firm backed by a Chinese tycoon, but scrapped it in late 2017 after a national security panel, the U.S. Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, failed to approve it.
""We continue to believe that this acquisition will be extremely positive for Aleris customers, employees and shareholders,"" Aleris Chairman and Chief Executive Sean Stack said in a statement.
Unusually, the Justice Department's Antitrust Division agreed with the companies to use binding arbitration to define the product market, which is usually the key battle in any antitrust fight as companies seek to make the relevant market as large so they look like relatively small players.
""This arbitration would allow the Antitrust Division to resolve the dispositive issue of market definition in this case efficiently and effectively, saving taxpayer resources,"" said Assistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim of the Justice Department's Antitrust Division, in a statement."

692,By Investing.com,"<span>Sep 04, 2019 05:08PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch," Investing.com – Here’s a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow.
 1. U.S. Data Deluge: Jobs, Services in Focus
The economic data calendar for Thursday is packed with top-tier economic data, including updates on the labor market, factory orders and services activity.
Ahead of Friday’s nonfarm payrolls due Friday, traders will look for a readthrough on the labor market with the release of ADP’s measure of private sector employment for August.
The report comes at 8:15 AM ET (12:15 GMT).
Economists, on average, expect that private nonfarm payrolls rose by 148,000 last month, down from a gain of 156,000 in July.
The Labor Department, at 8:30 AM ET, releases its weekly report on jobless claims -- people who filed for unemployment insurance. Economists forecast that initial jobless claims remained unchanged at 215,000 from the previous week.
An ISM survey on service sector activity is due at 10 AM ET.
Economists expect ISM nonmanufacturing data for August to show an uptick to a reading of 54, above July’s reading of 53.7.
And July factory orders are expected to have risen 1%, stronger than the 0.6% rise posted in June.
2. Crude Inventories in Spotlight as Oil Rallies
The Energy Information Administration (EIA) releases its petroleum report on Thursday, with oil prices latching onto the rally in risk assets and buoyed by expectations for another drawdown in oil stockpiles.
Ahead of the EIA report, the American Petroleum Institute released data, which often serves as an early indication of weekly petroleum levels, showing crude stockpiles rose by 0.4 million barrels last week.
The EIA is expected to report a drawdown in crude stockpiles of 2.49 million barrels.
Crude oil futures rallied 4.3% to settle at $56.20 a barrel.
3 . Lululemon Earnings Due
  Lululemon Athletica   (NASDAQ:LULU) reports results after Thursday's closing bell. 
The sportswear retailer is expected to report earnings of 89 cents per share on revenue of about $845 million.
As well as earnings, margins will likely come under scrutiny as the company has ramped up markdowns, particularly in menswear, despite plans to more than double its men’s business in the next five years. 
“We see a beat in the cards for Lulu driven by strength in top line, but remain nuetral, given less visibility into the promotional cadence and particularly in men’s business, coupled with premium valuation,” Wedbush said in a note.
In its first-quarter earnings report, Lululemon raised its guidance for the full financial year to between $3.73 billion and $3.77 billion in revenue and between $4.51 to $4.58 in earnings per share.
Shares rose 0.65% on Wednesday and are up 48.6% this year. The stock is one of the top 15 Nasdaq 100 performers in 2019"
693,By Investing.com,"<span>Sep 04, 2019 05:05PM ET</span>",Stocks - Techs Helps S&P Bounce Back From Slump,"Investing.com - U.S. stocks joined a global equity rally Wednesday, recouping Tuesday's losses.
The rally was set off by better economic news out of China and the Hong Kong government's decision to withdraw its controversial proposal to extradite people to mainland China. Gains in energy stocks also helped.
As important, chip stocks, led by Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), surged on hopes for better pricing and the Federal Reserve's Beige Book report for August suggested the domestic economy, overall, was weathering the stresses of the U.S.-China trade battle.
The S&P 500 rose 1.08%, with the Nasdaq Composite index rising 1.3% and the Dow Jones industrials up 0.91%. The gains for the S&P 500 and Nasdaq were larger than their Tuesday losses. The Dow, up 237 points, recovered more than 83% of its 285-point loss on Tuesday. 
The political news from the United Kingdom -- including a vote in Parliament to delay the UK leaving the European Union at the end of October unless there's a deal -- had little effect on U.S. stocks. It was the second losing vote for Prime Minister Boris Johnson in two days. But GBP/USD rose against the U.S. dollar.
Despite the rise in risk assets, gold prices surged, with gold futures closing at $1,560.40 an ounce in New York. Gold is up more than 21% this year.
Oil prices also surged. West Texas Internediate rose rose $2.32 to $56.20 a barrel. Brent crude, the global benchmark, topped $60 a barrel for the first time since Thursday, settling at $60.70 a barrel, up $2.44. WTI is up about 24% on the year; Brent has risen 12.8%. 
 
Interest rates moved lower again, with the 10-Year Treasury yield falling below 1.46%. The low yields have set off a rush of companies, including Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Walt   Disney   (NYSE:DIS) and Deere (NYSE:DE), selling bonds or starting the process to lock in low rates, The Wall Street Journal said.
Thursday brings a number of reports, including the Energy Information Administration's weekly report on oil inventories and the ADP National Employment Report, a lookahead to Friday's jobs report from the Labor Department.
Among the strongest sectors Wednesday were oil services, natural gas, chip stocks and hard drive stocks. 
Biotechnology, pharmaceutical and healthcare stocks were mostly lower.
Twenty-seven of the 30 Dow stocks were higher, led by Intel, up 4.1%. UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH),   Pfizer   (NYSE:PFE) and Merck (NYSE:MRK) were the only decliners. Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), however, gained just 0.09%.
Only 50 stocks in the S&P 500 were lower. 
Clothier PVH (NYSE:PVH); IPG Photonics (NASDAQ:IPGP), which makes lasers used in semiconductor manufacturing;   General Electric   (NYSE:GE) and athletic footwear retailer   Foot Locker   (NYSE:FL) were among the top performing S&P 500 issues. 
Meat and poultry processor   Tyson Foods   (NYSE:TSN), cosmetics maker and retailer Ulta Beauty (NASDAQ:ULTA), biotech company Incyte (NASDAQ:INCY) and Fortive (NYSE:FTV), maker of scientific instruments, were among the worst S&P 500 performers. "

The overhaul could result in hundreds of job cuts at the investment bank, especially within the higher ranks, FT reported, citing people familiar with the matter.
The newspaper said that the revamp is due to be announced at a townhall on Thursday.
UBS declined comment on the report.
The bank's main equities unit will be merged with its smaller foreign exchange, rates and credit trading (FRC) operations to form a single securities and trading unit, according to the report.
Ros Stephenson and Javier Oficialdegui would be named global co-heads of investment banking for an advisory role to overlook bank's M&A and capital markets activities around the world, FT said.

695,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 04, 2019 04:46PM ET</span>","Exxon, Shell cannot revive $1.8 billion Nigerian arbitration award: U.S. judge","By Jonathan Stempel
NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Wednesday rejected  Exxon Mobil  Corp's (N:XOM) and Royal Dutch Shell Plc's (L:RDSa) effort to revive a $1.8 billion arbitration award against Nigeria's state-run oil company, which stemmed from a dispute over a 1993 contract to extract oil near the African country's coastline.
U.S. District Judge William Pauley in Manhattan cited public policy and due process considerations in deciding not to enforce the October 2011 award against Nigerian National Petroleum Corp (NNPC), which was subsequently set aside by courts in Nigeria.
""While this court may have inherent authority to fashion appropriate relief in certain circumstances, exercising that authority to create a $1.8 billion judgment is a bridge too far,"" Pauley wrote in a 50-page decision.
The companies said last November that the award had grown to $2.67 billion, including interest.
Exxon, Shell and their respective lawyers did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
""NNPC is very pleased with the decision, and was always confident that there was no basis for a U.S. court to confirm the award,"" its lawyer Cecilia Moss said in an interview.
According to court papers, the 1993 contract anticipated that Exxon and Shell affiliates would invest billions of dollars to extract oil from the Erha field, about 60 miles (97 km) off Nigeria's coast, and share profits with NNPC.
But the affiliates, Esso Exploration and Production Nigeria Ltd and Shell Nigeria Exploration and Production Co Ltd, accused NNPC of unilaterally ""lifting"" more oil than was contractually allowed, at the behest of Nigeria's government, depriving them of billions of dollars of oil.
Pauley said Exxon and Shell still have ""multiple appeals pending"" in Nigeria, and rejected their argument that it might be difficult to collect there.
Exxon and Shell ""executed a contract in Nigeria with another Nigerian corporation containing an arbitration clause requiring any arbitration to be held in Nigeria under Nigerian law, and it then sought to confirm the award in Nigeria,"" Pauley wrote. ""[They] cannot now reasonably complain that [their] efforts to collect will be frustrated in Nigeria.""
In an Aug. 7 regulatory filing, Exxon said it did not expect the case to materially affect its operations or financial condition.
The case is Esso Exploration and Production Nigeria Ltd et al v Nigerian National Petroleum Corp, U.S. District Court, Southern (NYSE:SO) District of New York, No. 14-08445."
696,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 04, 2019 04:30PM ET</span>","Irked Emirates Boss Tells Airbus, Boeing to Raise Their Game","(Bloomberg) -- Emirates President Tim Clark delivered a broadside against Airbus SE and Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co. as well as their biggest engine suppliers, saying he’s no longer prepared to take delivery of aircraft that don’t meet specifications.
The veteran airline executive, who oversees the world’s largest international carrier, said he’s run out of patience with glitches that have held up new models or forced costly groundings for emergency repairs. He likened the nuisance to purchasing a new luxury car, only to have the dealer warn that the engine will need changing after three months.
“That’s not going to happen any more,” Clark said at a briefing Wednesday in London. “When they’re ready to give us what they’re contracted to do then we will have an assessment of the number and type of aircraft that are going to be used.”
Delivered from one of the most respected executives in the aviation world, it’s a stern message that threatens to have repercussions across the industry. At stake are orders for more than 250 wide-body jets, which Clark said Emirates won’t take without a cast-iron guarantee of trouble-free performance.
Boeing rose less than 1% to $356.58 at 2:46 p.m. in New York. Airbus advanced 1.3% to 126.20 euros at the close in Paris.
Rolls-Royce, GE
Both Airbus and Boeing have suffered performance setbacks with their aircraft, and Clark said he can’t be sure about the reliability of the Rolls-Royce Holdings Plc (LON:RR) engines that power the planes, or that the U.K. company has resolved issues with a turbine it supplies for the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, of which Emirates has 40 on order.
Clark’s warning comes against the background of a fleet review triggered by a deteriorating global economy and the looming demise of Airbus’s A380 superjumbo, around which Emirates had previously built its business.
It also serves notice to Airbus and Boeing, which enjoy a duopoly in the market for the biggest globe-spanning jets, that they have no chance of gaining final agreement for the slew of contracts by the time of November’s Dubai Air Show without a major shift in commitments. Emirates announced a $21 billion deal for 30 A350-900s and 40 A330-900neos earlier this year, though the order has yet to be signed off.
At the same time, Clark said, it’s also impossible to know when the 777X will enter service after Boeing pushed back the first flight to 2020 and said deliveries may be delayed amid problems with its  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Co.-made turbines. Emirates is the launch customer for the plane, with 150 orders.
Let Down
Clark insisted that Emirates hasn’t over-ordered on jets and said it has always honored its obligations, despite being consistently let down, citing under-performing Rolls-Royce engines on the A380. He said the issue has become more acute given punitive damages being levied under consumer-protection laws, even taking into account compensation from planemakers.
The timing may be right for Clark to turn to hardball. In an interview, he said he’s seeing “signs of diminishing demand,” and growth falling amid trade tensions and political upheaval. Hong Kong, for example, has seen the so-called seat factor drop by 10 percentage points in the wake of weeks of continued protest, he said, with freight demand also “greatly affected” by the upheaval.
“We’re not in a good place at the moment, but we’ll deal with it,” Clark said. “At the moment, I don’t see any green shoots,” and bottoming out might take 3 to 5 years, he said.
Even before global demand took a turn for the worse, Clark, who is a British knight, had initiated the fleet review, partly driven by end of the A380. With Airbus closing production after the final run of planes is built, Emirates will retire the double-decker in the next 10 to 15 years and “look at the range of alternatives to maintain the structure of network,” Clark said.
The review signals shifting priorities for Emirates, which turned itself into the world’s largest international carrier by deploying the superjumbo and original 777 to funnel global travelers through Dubai.
Clark, the plan’s architect during 16 years in charge, has acknowledged that the very biggest jets may be nearing the limits of expansion at the airline and that some cities may be better served with a different fleet makeup.
Emirates is mulling its fleet profile as part of a wider strategy study begun in February. The Gulf carrier slashed its order for the A380, for which it’s by far the biggest customer, by 39 planes to 123 after reaching an impasse with Rolls on the price and fuel efficiency of the latest batch of aircraft. Clark said he wants to take the remaining eight or nine jets, though that’s contingent on reaching a final agreement on the other Airbus planes.
The carrier has meanwhile retired two superjumbos and begun removing landing gear for use on newer planes. Clark said that with no second-hand market for the A380 both aircraft may be dismantled for further components.

697,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 04, 2019 04:29PM ET</span>",Huawei Says U.S. Bid to Remove Lawyer Is Part of ‘Agenda’,"(Bloomberg) -- A lawyer defending Huawei Technologies Co. against charges that it violated U.S. sanctions on Iran told a federal judge an effort to remove its lead attorney from the case was part of a government “agenda” against the Chinese tech giant.
Federal prosecutors have asked U.S. District Judge Ann Donnelly in Brooklyn, New York, to disqualify James M. Cole as lead attorney for Huawei’s defense team. They say Cole, during a four-year stint as deputy attorney general, had access to classified matters that appear to be “substantially” connected to Huawei.
“This case is part of an overall agenda which the government has against Huawei,” Michael Levy told Donnelly. “There is something of a campaign here in wanting to disqualify Mr. Cole that can be seen as one more tactical step. It’s a dangerous area.”
In addition to bringing the Brooklyn case, the government has filed criminal charges against Huawei in federal court in Seattle, accusing it of stealing trade secrets from T-Mobile US (NASDAQ:TMUS) Inc. The U.S. has also banned Huawei’s technology and accused the company of helping Beijing carry out espionage.
Cole, a partner at Sidley Austin LLP, served as Attorney General Eric Holder’s deputy from 2011 to 2015. Donnelly, who didn’t issue a public ruling Wednesday, held a portion of the hearing in open court, then ordered the courtroom sealed to discuss classified material and matters of national security.
Read More: Huawei Iran-Sanctions Evidence Is Too Risky for China to See
During the public portion of the hearing, prosecutor David Kessler argued that while working in the government, Cole had been privy to discussions regarding a “prior matter” that had a “substantial relationship to this one.”
“It’s a unique case, but we don’t think it’s a close call,” Kessler said. “The ultimate question is whether Mr. Cole was in the government’s confidences from his prior representation. We believe he has had these confidences, absolutely.”
While prosecutors didn’t disclose what those confidences were, Levy said the “related matter” was the federal investigation of  HSBC Holdings  Plc (LON:HSBA). In 2012, HSBC paid $1.9 billion to resolve a criminal investigation into whether it violated U.S. sanctions laws on Iran and laundered at least $881 million on behalf of drug cartels. That investigation led prosecutors to Huawei’s Iran dealings, people familiar with the matter have said.
Donnelly questioned Huawei’s argument that even if Cole had been privy to classified matters or matters of national security, he should be permitted to remain on the case because he doesn’t remember them. Huawei has also argued the U.S. took too long to object to Cole’s working as a defense lawyer on the case.
“I take it your position is Mr. Cole doesn’t remember these things,” she said to Levy. “If there really is a conflict, and in the middle of the trial, all of a sudden, a memory is triggered, we don’t want to be in that position, do we?”

Huawei earlier this month accused the U.S. government of orchestrating a campaign to intimidate its employees and launching cyberattacks to infiltrate its internal network. The accusations have ratcheted up tensions between Huawei and the Trump administration, which has accused the networking company of helping Beijing spy and labeled it a national security risk. Washington has blacklisted Huawei, curbing sales of the technology it needs to make its phones and telecommunications equipment.
The U.S. House Intelligence Committee said in 2012 that Huawei and ZTE Corp (HK:0763)., China’s two largest phone-equipment makers, provide opportunities for Chinese intelligence services to tamper with U.S. telecom networks for spying. Matthew Whitaker, as acting attorney general, echoed such security concerns when he announced both Huawei prosecutions in January.
Meng Wanzhou, Huawei’s chief financial officer, who is also charged in the case, remains free on bail in Vancouver, Canada, while she fights extradition to the U.S.
The case is U.S. v. Huawei Technologies Co., 18-cr-457, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of New York (Brooklyn).

T-Mobile Workers United, with about 500 members and backed by the Communications Workers of America and the German union ver.di, urged Hoettges to ""make solid and verifiable"" assurances that jobs will be safe, paychecks will not shrink and management will not interfere in union activities.
Deutsche Telekom, which owns 63% of T-Mobile, did not immediately reply to a request for comment. 
The letter was given to a board member meeting with union members in Seattle late Tuesday. The board member was to give it to Hoettges.
T-Mobile's deal to buy Sprint for $26 billion faces a court challenge from 15 states and the District of Columbia who argue that the planned merger will mean higher prices for consumers. The trial is set for December 9.
The Justice Department signed off on the merger while the Federal Communications Commission has indicated it plans to approve it, and has begun the process of formally doing so.

Morgan survey showed on Wednesday.
The ongoing drop in bond yields has led some money managers to reckon the move may be overdone at least for now, analysts said.
The share of investors who said on Monday they were ""short,"" or holding fewer longer-dated Treasuries than their portfolio benchmarks, exceeded the share who said they were ""long,"" or holding more longer-term government debt issues than their benchmarks, by 2 percentage points.
This was the first time short investors outnumbered long ones since July 8, according to J.P. Morgan.
A week ago, investors were net long by 4 percentage points.
Last week, the yields on U.S. 30-year Treasury bonds (US30YT=RR) hit a record low of 1.905%, according to Refinitiv data.

703,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 04, 2019 01:56PM ET</span>",Impala Platinum delays job cuts due to improved earnings: sources,"By Zandi Shabalala and Tanisha Heiberg
LONDON/JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - Impala Platinum (J:IMPJ) will delay cutting thousands of jobs and closing some capacity at its main South African mine due to operational improvements and higher commodity prices, two sources with direct knowledge of the matter said.
One of the world's largest producers of autocatalyst materials platinum and palladium, Implats is overhauling its Rustenburg mine, which is its largest. Operational inefficiencies at Rustenburg have for years undermined Impala's profits.
""Revenue is up,"" one of the sources said, adding that mines that were going to close were now making money or will soon be making money.
Implats will delay closing Rustenburg's shaft 12 by one year and shaft 9 by about six months, the source added.
Implats declined to comments ahead of its full-year results on Thursday.
Last year, Implats said plans to restructure Rustenburg would cut about a third of the mine's workforce - more than 13,000 jobs - over two years, and reduce the number of active shafts to six from 11, which would have cut the company's output by about a third by 2021.
Both platinum and palladium are mainly used in autocatalysts to cut noxious emissions from fossil-fueled cars.
Large surpluses of platinum and shrinking demand, particularly since Volkswagen's ""dieselgate"" scandal in 2015 saw platinum prices crash to $751.25 an ounce last year, a far cry from peaks above $2,000 a decade earlier.
But platinum has risen 30% from those lows, with prices shooting up to around $1,000 in recent days, and palladium prices have jumped more than 80% over the same period to around $1,550 an ounce.
A more than doubling this year in the value of rhodium , a byproduct of platinum, to above $5,000 an ounce and a weak rand against the dollar have also helped boost earnings at South African miners.

However, Impala's older shafts running out of ore to mine and reaching the end of their natural lives make a complete reversal of the closure plan impossible, the sources said.
Attempts to sell Rustenburg's shaft 1, the only one put up for sale by Implats, did not attract any credible bidders, the sources said, and the mine will be contracted out.
Implats has already cut about 2,000 jobs, the sources said.
A presentation seen by Reuters shows half the shafts at the Rustenburg operation have swung to a full year profit, including those slated for closure. The company is also considering using more contractors to mine some shafts, the sources said.
Implats' share price, which is highly geared towards a higher platinum price, has outperformed its South African rivals  Anglo American  (LON:AAL) Platinum (J:AMSJ) and  Northam  Platinum (J:NHMJ).

Deutsche Bank analyst Sidney Ho said fourth-quarter random access memory (DRAM) price action suggests a trough, easing investor fears the glut in memory supplies would continue to hurt prices at a time when Japan and Korea remained locked in a trade war.
Micron's gain was second-best among stocks in the Nasdaq 100 Index, which was up 1.26%.
But the Japan-Korea trade issues are unlikely to have a meaningful impact on supplies, Ho added.
In July, Japan imposed export restrictions to South Korea, which controls about 70% of the global market for DRAM and 50% for NAND flash memory.
The sober outlook on memory demand echoed remarks from Micron (NASDAQ:MU) CEO Sanjay Mehrotra, who earlier this year said that the company was “seeing early signs of demand improvement.”
Memory prices have been hurt by falling demand for memory chips at various levels, with smartphone and server shipments in a funk.
Deutsche Bank has a buy rating on Micron and a price target of $55 on the stock. The consensus 12-month target price on the stock is $48.04.
Micron is up more than 48% year to date, outpacing the broader sector, with the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index up around 31% for the year so far.
The bullish note on memory prices, sparked a wave of green across semis with   Western Digital   (NASDAQ:WDC) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) set to end the day markedly higher."
705,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 04, 2019 01:45PM ET</span>","Trump Says Dow Would Be 10,000 Points Higher Without Trade War","(Bloomberg) -- Donald Trump said his trade war with China has hurt the performance of the U.S. stock market, but that he had to confront the country’s economic practices.
“Let me tell you, if I wanted to do nothing with China, our stock market, our stock market would be 10,000 points higher than it is right now but somebody had to do this,” the president told reporters at the White House on Wednesday. “It was out of control and they were out of control.”
The Dow Jones Industrial Average stood at 26,332 as of about 1:00 p.m. in Washington, up less than 1 percent for the day. Trump increased tariffs on Chinese imports this week to try to elbow Beijing into resuming talks on a far-reaching trade deal.
“We’ll see what happens, if they want to make a deal, they’ll make a deal, if they don’t want to make a deal, that’s fine,” he said.
He declined to say whether Chinese negotiators will visit Washington this month."

""It's a national security concern,"" Trump told reporters at the White House. ""Huawei is a big concern of our military, of our intelligence agencies, and we are not doing business with Huawei.
""And we'll see what happens with respect to China, but Huawei has been not a player that we want to discuss, (that) we want to talk about right now.""
It was unclear whether Trump's comments indicated a change on whether he would be open to discussing the Chinese tech giant in trade talks with Beijing.
The U.S. president in the past has said he would be open to including Huawei in talks to reach a trade deal with Beijing. Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping this summer agreed the United States would ease restrictions on Huawei Technologies Co Ltd and China would make unspecified purchases of U.S. farm products.
The United States placed Huawei on the Commerce Department’s so-called Entity List in May over national security concerns. U.S. parts and components generally cannot be sold to those on the list without special licenses."

Some of the next round of strikes will coincide with multi-day strikes by Ryanair pilots and cabin crew in Spain.
BALPA members said they will walk out again on Sept. 18, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27 and 29. Ryanair's Spanish pilots will also be on strike on Sept 19, 27 and 29, while the ninth of 10 strike days called by their cabin crew colleagues is due on Sept. 27.
While widespread strikes over pay and conditions a year ago forced Ryanair to cancel hundreds of flights, the first series of strikes since then in Britain, Spain and Portugal has caused minimal disruption in recent weeks.
Ryanair flights to and from Britain ran as scheduled over the last three days during BALPA's latest strike, having also caused no cancellations during the union's first walkout last month.
So far only 14 Spanish flights have been affected by the industrial action, representing less than one percent of the Irish airline's daily schedule to and from Spain.
In a statement Ryanair described the latest BALPA strikes as ""pointless"" given their initial industrial action had caused zero cancellations. 
Ryanair has said only around half of the pilots operating from UK airports are members BALPA.
BALPA said the airline was using contractors, who are not entitled to join unions, and crews from other jurisdictions to ensure flights operated.
""We are clear that we want to settle the dispute and bring about a change in Ryanair for the better. Ryanair should stop dragging its feet,"" BALPA General Secretary Brian Strutton said in a statement.

716,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 04, 2019 12:32PM ET</span>","Banker to reveal workings of trading scheme in German fraud trial, court told","By John O'Donnell
BONN (Reuters) - A British banker charged with fraud in Germany has agreed to reveal the workings of a share trading scheme which prosecutors allege cost the country 450 million euros ($501 million) in lost taxes, his lawyer said on Wednesday.
In a breakthrough for Germany's biggest fraud inquiry, Hellen Schilling, a lawyer acting for one of two defendants in the case, said Martin Shields had already made a significant contribution in explaining the scheme to prosecutors.
The trial is the first in a wider investigation aimed at recovering billions from banks who profited from a scheme described by finance minister Olaf Scholz as a 'scandal' which Germany estimates cost it more than 5 billion euros. 
Prosecutors in Germany allege that players in the so-called cum-ex scheme misled the state into thinking a stock had multiple owners who were each owed a dividend and a tax credit.
German state prosecutor Anne Brorhilker earlier outlined criminal charges against Shields and fellow British banker Nicholas Diable, who she said organized a network of traders and lenders to make double tax reclaims with sham share trades.
""Mr. Shields is the first (to be put on trial) but he is not the only one and he is not the central figure in cum-ex,"" Schilling told judges, adding that the 41-year-old banker's evidence would make it easier to accelerate the case.
Diable, 38, declined to make a statement to court. His lawyer did not respond to a request from Reuters for comment.
Neither of the defendants is required to enter an immediate plea, according to usual German court proceedings but will launch their defense in the coming weeks.
The alleged scheme involved trading shares rapidly around a syndicate of banks, investors and hedge funds to give the impression of numerous owners, each entitled to a tax rebate.
Brorhilker alleged the two men, who face a possible jail term and a state order to repay any profits they made, were involved in organizing sham share trades in companies including carmaker BMW and airline Lufthansa between 2006 and 2011.
Brorhilker described how the two had started when working at German bank HVB, before moving to a small investment firm, tapping a wide network of contacts to arrange the trades, sometimes splitting the profit made with banks involved.
She outlined more than 30 instances of double-tax reclaims totaling 447 million euros and involving banks including Germany's Warburg Group, BNY Mellon and  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN).
Those banks have also been included in the German court trial and may have to repay any profit made from the schemes.
A spokesman for Warburg said that it had not received such multiple tax rebates and had never set out to do so, while Societe Generale and BNY Mellon declined to comment. 
A spokeswoman for HVB, which has blamed its involvement on wrongdoing by individuals, declined further comment. 
Germany changed and clarified the law in 2007, 2009 and 2012 to prevent cum-ex trades, but the scam then hit Denmark, where tax authorities say they lost $2 billion in rebates.
The discovery of the trades in Germany and Denmark prompted investigations by other countries, including Austria and Belgium, which have found they were also affected, albeit on a far smaller scale.

718,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 04, 2019 12:09PM ET</span>","IPO hopeful WeWork adds woman to board, CEO returns $5.9 million, after backlash","By Joshua Franklin
NEW YORK (Reuters) - WeWork owner The We Company took some steps on Wednesday to burnish its appeal to investors ahead of its initial public offering by adding a woman, Frances Frei, to its all-male board and announcing that its CEO would return a $5.9 million payment for use of the trademarked word ""We.""
The moves follow investor criticism of We Company's IPO filing last month, which revealed extensive and unusual ties between the office space sharing startup and its controlling shareholder, CEO Adam Neumann, including him being a landlord to the company on some properties. 
Corporate governance advocates cautioned the We Company's latest steps may not be enough to quell concerns about Neumann's grip on the company, cemented by a multi-class share structure designed to give him operational control. 
""These are positive steps,"" said David Erickson, a senior fellow and finance lecturer at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School.
""The challenge is, from my vantage point, you've got a CEO who is going to control decision making that has to date not demonstrated the good judgment that I would expect from the CEO of a public company.""
Frei, a professor of technology and operations management at Harvard Business School, will join WeWork's board once it completes the IPO, planned for later this month. 
The We Company had originally planned to go public with an all-male seven-member board, a practice major investors such as BlackRock Inc (N:BLK) frown upon https://de.reuters.com/article/us-blackrock-climate-exclusive/exclusive-blackrock-vows-new-pressure-on-climate-board-diversity-idUKKBN16K0CR, saying more diverse boards make better decisions. 
The We Company also said in an amended filing it will add another director to its board within a year of the IPO, ""with a commitment to increasing the board's gender and ethnic diversity."" 
The deal to pay Neumann for use of the ""We"" trademark came after the decision to rebrand WeWork as the We Company earlier this year. 
WeWork, which rents desks to companies and individuals with a focus on startups and entrepreneurs, has helped popularize the concept of shared office space. It was valued at $47 billion earlier this year. 
Despite the company's breakneck growth, there are investor concerns over a mismatch between its cash flow and liabilities, given that it rents workspace to clients under short-term contracts, but pays rent for them itself under long-term leases.

New York-based We Company, founded in 2010, saw its revenue double to $1.54 billion in the first half of this year, though its losses were 25% higher during the period than a year earlier, at $900 million.

Last month, a climate activist group smashed up 40 luxury vehicles and called for a boycott of this month's Frankfurt Auto Show because it celebrates an ""outmoded climate and environment destroying transportation system.""
Porsche, part of Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), said on Wednesday it would invest 6 billion euros ($6.7 billion) through 2022 to develop electric vehicles, as it presented its first zero-emissions sports car.
""With the Taycan, Porsche offers an entirely leather-free interior for the first time. Interiors made from innovative recycled materials underscore the sustainable concept of the electric sports car,"" Porsche said.
The Taycan has a range of 450 kilometers, making it the first electric vehicle from a German carmaker capable of rivaling Tesla (O:TSLA) in terms of operating range.
Thanks to an 800 volt system, the car is also capable of adding 100 kilometers to its range from a five minute recharging of its battery, Porsche said.
The Porsche Taycan Turbo S is priced at 185,456 euros, or 138,826 pounds. First customer deliveries are anticipated from January 2020, the carmaker said.
Other sports car makers are also rushing to develop electric models. Ferrari (N:RACE) said last month it hoped to introduce a fully-electric model some time after 2022."

(Reuters) - U.S. stocks rose on Wednesday as upbeat data from China's services sector eased concerns about a global economic slowdown, while Hong Kong's withdrawal of a controversial bill supported sentiment.
Activity in China's services sector expanded at the fastest pace in three months in August, providing a boost to the world's second-largest economy that has been struggling to reverse a prolonged slump in its manufacturing sector.
Sentiment also got a lift after Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam withdrew an extradition bill that had triggered months of often violent protests in the Chinese-ruled city.
The three main indexes had come under pressure on Tuesday after the United States and China imposed new tariffs on each other's goods and data showed a contraction in U.S. factory activity in August.
""The positive economic news out of China is offsetting the weak manufacturing data from the U.S. yesterday and diminishes the fear of an economic downturn,"" said Shawn Gibson, chief investment officer at asset management firm Liquid Strategies.
""Global growth and not just U.S. growth is a very important narrative for investors because a strong Chinese economy is important to our economy as well,"" Gibson added.
Markets struggled last month as escalating trade tensions and the inversion of a key part of the U.S. yield curve, often seen as a sign of recession, drove investors away from risky assets and pushed the S&P 500 (SPX) to log its worst August in four years.
Further easing concerns of a slowdown were comments from New York Federal Reserve President John Williams (NYSE:WMB) who said he is ready to ""act as appropriate"" to help the United States avoid an economic downturn but so far the economy appeared to be in a good place.
Ten of the 11 major S&P sectors were higher, with a 1.05% rise in technology stocks (SPLRCT) providing the biggest boost.
Trade-sensitive chipmakers accounted for a major portion of those gains, with the Philadelphia Semiconductor index (SOX) up 2.18%.
Bank stocks rose 2.18%, bouncing back from a selloff on Tuesday when the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield (US10YT=RR) hit its lowest since July 2016.
UBS slashed its forecasts for global growth and government bond yields, predicting 10-year U.S. yield, the benchmark for global borrowing costs, would end the year at just 1%.
Gibson said the nonfarm payrolls report due Friday will be very critical, because any sort of weakness in data could push Treasury yields even lower and signal that bond investors are concerned about an upcoming recession.
At 10:17 a.m. ET the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) was up 148.56 points, or 0.57%, at 26,266.58, the S&P 500 (SPX) was up 16.88 points, or 0.58%, at 2,923.15 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) was up 57.02 points, or 0.72%, at 7,931.18.
 Tyson Foods  Inc (N:TSN) shares fell 5.2% to the bottom of the S&P 500 after the United States' biggest meat processor cut its 2019 earnings forecast.
PVH Corp (N:PVH) jumped 3% as the Calvin Klein-owner's chief executive officer, Emanuel Chirico, on Tuesday announced plans to buy company shares.
Data showed the U.S. trade deficit narrowed slightly in July as exports rebounded, but the gap with China surged to a six-month high.

724,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 04, 2019 11:16AM ET</span>","Tyson Foods slowed chicken processing after recalls, raising costs","By Tom Polansek
(Reuters) -  Tyson Foods  Inc (N:TSN) slowed chicken processing this year after it recalled millions of pounds of poultry over concerns they contained materials like rubber and metal, raising its costs, Chief Executive Noel White said on Wednesday.
The higher costs contributed to a $220-million cut to the company's expected adjusted earnings for 2019 on Tuesday, White said at an investor conference. Almost half of the cut was linked to Tyson's poultry business, he said, providing new details on the adjustment. 
Tyson is also grappling with volatility in prices for grain used to feed chickens and a fire that shut a large beef plant in Holcomb, Kansas.
Shares of the company sank 5% to $88.56 in morning trading. 
""It was extremely unusual to have that number of events within one quarter,"" White said. 
The slowdown in chicken production shows the financial pain that can stem from recalls of products suspected of being contaminated with foreign objects.
Tyson recalled nearly 12 million pounds of frozen, ready-to-eat chicken strips in May and 40,000 pounds of chicken patties in August. 
The company wanted to ensure its products are safe and has implemented ""corrective measures"" to get its chicken plants back at full production, White said.
""That came at a pretty significant cost,"" he said at the conference, without providing details.
About 30% of the cut in Tyson's earnings forecast was related to a drop in corn prices, which worked against positions Tyson held in grain markets, White said.
Tyson recorded a $40 million gain in its chicken unit in the third quarter that ended on June 29 as corn futures rose, benefiting its position in grain markets. The company said last month that profit would likely be reversed in the fourth quarter as corn prices have declined.
Grain prices remain volatile and swings could affect Tyson's earnings per share, White said.

Chief Financial Officer Patrick Grismer told a consumer retail conference hosted by Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) that he expected adjusted per-share profit growth for 2020 to be lower than the current 10% rate, pushing shares in the coffee chain down 4%.
Grismer said the tax benefit recorded in 2019 could be a ""significant headwind"" to profit growth in 2020. 
He also added that the company had brought forward its plans to buy back $2 billion worth of shares to 2019 from 2020 and hinted at fewer share repurchases next year.
Wall Street analysts currently forecast adjusted earnings of $3.12 per share for 2020, implying a growth rate of 10.45%, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. 
The company will be providing the outlook for the next year on October 30, when it reports its fourth-quarter results.
The coffee chain reported its best quarterly sales growth in three years in July, boosted by an expanded line up of beverages and food offerings in the United States and China, prompting the company to raise its profit forecast for the current year. 

Grismer remained confident in boosting sales growth, driven by beverages such as its cold brew and Nitro cold brew as well as seasonal beverages.

RIYADH (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc (N:BLK), the world's largest fund manager, has opened an office in Saudi Arabia, pushing ahead with plans to capitalize on the government's ambitious reform agenda despite global criticism of its human rights record.
A company spokeswoman said the Riyadh office had opened recently and is headed by Yazeed Almubarak, who previously worked at  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS) and Saudi bank Jadwa Investment, according to his LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) page.
Chief Executive Larry Fink last year said that BlackRock would not cut ties with the kingdom, which came under pressure over the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Fink pulled out of a major investment conference in Riyadh at the time.
BlackRock, with oversight of more than $6.4 trillion in assets, is widely followed by investors and economists for its influence at many of the world’s public companies.
Plans to open an office in Saudi Arabia were announced in 2017 as Riyadh began courting investors to support its push to diversify the economy away from oil.
Khashoggi, a critic of the kingdom's de facto ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, was murdered by Saudi agents inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in October 2018.
Saudi officials deny accusations that Prince Mohammed had a role in the killing, but Western governments continue to press for greater accountability."

He said a ""premium compact SUV"" would be produced in the southern-Italy Pomigliano plant, near Naples, along with hybrid Panda, but did not confirm it was the Alfa Romeo Tonale.
The company has already begun investing to prepare the plant near Naples for production. The plant already produces traditional Panda cars.
The production of the hybrid Panda is expected to start in the first half of next year, while that of the Tonale in the first half of 2021.
Earlier this year, FCA said it was investing 700 million euros to start building the production line for the new Fiat 500 electric in its historic Mirafiori plant in Turin, as the carmaker moved on from its failed $35 billion bid to merge with France's  Renault  (PA:RENA).
Production will start in the second quarter of 2020.
Hybrid versions of Jeep models Compass and Renegade and of Maserati's Levante SUV are also expected to hit the market next year."

The new products, glo pro and glo nano, come with new heating technologies and slimmer sizes and will be available in Japan from October, the company said, a month after it launched another product - glo sens - in Tokyo. The glo brand was introduced in Japan in 2016.
The introduction of these vaping devices, known as ""heat-not-burn"" products, is part of new Chief Executive Jack Bowles' plan to slim down the company's ""new categories"" business to just three brands, including glo.
Unlike combustible cigarettes, heat-not-burn products heat tobacco-filled sticks wrapped in paper to generate an aerosol that contains nicotine. They are different from e-cigarettes such as the popular Juul device, which vaporizes a nicotine-filled liquid.
Philip Morris leads the heat-not-burn (HNB) market with its iQOS product in Japan, which has emerged as a fertile test ground for vaping products since e-cigarettes using nicotine-laced liquid are not allowed under the country's pharmaceutical regulation.
According to analysts at Nomura, the HNB market nearly doubled in Japan in 2018 from the year earlier, with iQOS commanding a 71.8% share of the market, followed by BAT's glo products with 20.1%. Local player Japan Tobacco Inc's (T:2914) Ploom TECH comes third with 8.1%.
The urgency for BAT to strengthen its business in Japan comes on the heels of Philip Morris' announcement last week that it was in talks to merge with Altria (NYSE:MO), which has a stake in U.S. e-cigarette market leader Juul.
Analysts have said their proposed combination could create a company with the scale and resources to dominate the e-cigarette market."

MUMBAI (Reuters) - Creditors of India's bankrupt Jet Airways (NS:JET) are likely to recover less than 10% of the carrier's total outstanding dues in a liquidation scenario if no suitor succeeds in buying the airline, two sources told Reuters.
The airline's financial and operational creditors, who are owed nearly 300 billion Indian rupees ($4.20 billion) are likely to recover only $300-$400 million from the sale of Jet's assets, the sources, who have direct knowledge of the matter, said.
""The expected recovery on owned planes and real estate is $300-400 million after repaying debt tied specifically to those assets,"" said one of the sources.
The sources, who asked not to be named as they have not been cleared to discuss the matter with media, said Jet currently has some four to six Boeing (N:BA) and Airbus (PA:AIR) aircraft, and some real estate assets in India, on which there are some outstanding dues.
The airline, less than a year ago, was operating a fleet of more than 120 planes that flew to dozens of domestic destinations and international hubs such as Singapore, London and Dubai.
Once India's biggest private carrier, Jet stopped flying in April after running out of cash, leaving thousands without jobs and pushing up air fares across the country. It was admitted to bankruptcy court in June after its lenders, led by  State Bank of India  (NS:SBI), failed to agree on a revival plan.
The court-appointed resolution professional, now responsible for the company, declined to comment and said that the focus remains on resolution and not liquidation at this stage."

Luis, 51, stepped into the CEO role more than five years ago with the aim of transforming Tapestry into a global fashion house after successfully building the company's business in China, the world's fastest-growing market for luxury goods.
Under Luis, the company changed its name to Tapestry from  Coach  and added shoemaker Stuart Weitzman and millennial-focused Kate Spade. 
But his tenure at the helm has been fraught with challenges as the company struggled to integrate the brands and keep up with latest fashion trends.
Shares have halved during Luis' term as CEO. They were up about 3% in trading before the bell. 
""We ultimately came to the conclusion that as much as we believe in our strategy, there was a gap between our strategic intent and operational delivery,"" Zeitlin told Reuters. 
""It made sense to change leadership at the very top.""
A former Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) executive, Zeitlin has been chairman since 2014 and a director since 2006.
The 55-year-old said he would continue to focus on integrating the two brands, Stuart Weitzman and Kate Spade, with no plans of adding more labels through acquisitions in the near future.
""We feel quite good about where the Coach brand is ... A lot of growth opportunities will come from Kate Spade,"" Zeitlin said. 

Tapestry's board now holds eight members after the departure of Luis and will lead a search for a future CEO, the company said.

PARIS (Reuters) - French reinsurer Scor's (PA:SCOR) CEO Denis Kessler, who opposed a takeover by rival Covea last year, on Wednesday unveiled growth targets for 2019-2021 as he sought to allay investor concerns over his strategy for the group.
In a new strategic plan dubbed ""Quantum Leap"" -- the seventh since he took over in 2002 -- Kessler forecast gross written premiums would grow organically by an annual average of 4% to 7%.
Kessler, who is also chairman, said he sought a return on equity at or above 800 basis points above the 5-year risk-free rate.
""Over the plan's period,  Scor  will continue to combine growth, profitability and solvency, to create value benefiting to all stakeholders,"" he said.
The CEO's previous strategic plan for 2016-2019 had set the same targets for growth and return on equity. Both objectives were broadly met.
Scor's share price rose 1.7 percent in early trading, outperforming the CAC-40 index, but by lunchtime were hovering only fractionally above their opening price of 36.59 euros.
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), which rates the shares ""overweight"", said the headline targets were in line with its expectations.
""We believe they continue to underpin a healthy organic growth outlook over the coming years,"" the investment bank said in a research note.
Kessler, 67, has had to face down investor disquiet over his ability to generate shareholder returns after he opposed an 8.2 billion-euro ($9.14 billion) takeover bid by unlisted rival Covea in September, 2018.
Activist fund CIAM asked fellow shareholders to remove Kessler from the board. The fund said the rejection of Covea's bid and a subsequent lawsuit filed by Scor against Covea for breach of trust were detrimental to shareholder interests.
In April, though, three-quarters of shareholders voted for Kessler to remain CEO, while about 54% approved his pay package.
He is expected to reveal a succession plan in late 2020, with his current and final term due to end in mid 2021.
Scor also said it would invest 250 million euros to implement the plan, mainly n technological upgrades."

KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysia's government said on Wednesday its decision last month to extend a license for Australia's Lynas Corp for processing rare earth minerals aimed to show investors that the Southeast Asian nation was open for business and preserve 600 jobs.
Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad's party had promised to halt the firm's operations when campaigning in the May 2018 election, after concerns were raised by politicians and activists about the production of radioactive waste from the process.
Lynas, the largest rare earths producer outside China that sells most of its products to China, says the low-level radioactive waste is not hazardous.
The government said last month it was extending the firm's license, a move that sparked protests from activists and politicians even though it set tougher terms and offered a six-month extension that was shorter than usual.
Outlining reasons for the government's decision, the prime minister's office said closing the operation would lead to more than 600 local employees losing their jobs and it would have a ""negative impact on Malaysia's credibility as a business-friendly country"".
The prime minister's office also said in the statement that failing to extend the license would mean Malaysia would be ""unable to break the Chinese monopoly as the sole exporter of rare earths"".
China has a tight grip on the rare earths market, as the world's biggest producer of the minerals that are used in smartphones and other consumer electronics, and also used in the defense industry and other sectors.
The U.S. Department of Defense has been in talks with Australia to host a facility that would process rare earth minerals in an effort to reduce reliance on China for the specialized materials.
Activists in Malaysia have urged the government to review the decision to extend the license for Lynas.
""We hope they can re-examine their mistakes and start to serve the interests of the people,"" Tan Bun Teet, chairman of non-government group 'Save Malaysia Stop Lynas', told Reuters."

PARIS (Reuters) -  Carrefour  (PA:CARR) is launching two Supeco stores in northern France this month, Europe's largest food retailer said on Wednesday.
Supeco was launched by Carrefour in Spain in 2012 when Pascal Clouzard headed the Spanish business. Clouzard became Carrefour France boss in 2017.
Carrefour currently operates 23 Supeco stores in Spain, 15 in Romania, two in Poland, and one in Italy.
The first French store will open in Valenciennes on Wednesday and a second will open on Sept. 25 in Onnaing, it said.
""Carrefour is adapting Supeco to the French market to propose a model based on soft discount,"" the company said, referring to marketing that is less stripped down than full-fledged cash and carry outlets.
The stores will offer bakery and butcher corners and more fresh products than a typical cash and carry store.
The French stores will offer about 2,000 products instead of 15,000 in a traditional Carrefour supermarket, at what the group says will be attractive prices.
Carrefour-branded goods will make up the bulk of the food products to be offered.
Carrefour, which operates over 12,000 stores worldwide, including 5,200 in France, is in the midst of a five-year restructuring plan to cut costs and boost performance.
It faces pressure in France from traditional rivals such Leclerc and from Amazon (O:AMZN), as well as in the discount sector from Lidl, which has successfully changed its business model to expand its market share to nearly 6%.
U.S. warehouse club operator Costco (O:COST) also opened its first warehouse in 2017 in Villebon-Sur-Yvette, near Paris, and plans more stores.
Carrefour exited hard discounting last year in France when it closed or sold 273 underperforming Dia stores."

KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysia approved U.S. investment worth $5.62 billion in the first half of the year compared with $113 million the previous year, the government said on Wednesday, a possible sign of a diversion of U.S. business as a trade row with China drags on.
U.S. and Chinese companies alike are looking at moving some of their manufacturing out of China to escape tit-for-tat tariffs imposed on each other's products.
Economists say Vietnam and Malaysia are likely to be the biggest beneficiaries, though countries such as India are also trying to attract companies such as Apple (O:AAPL), Foxconn (TW:2354) and  Wistron Corp  (TW:3231).
The Malaysian Investment Development Authority, which shared the data on foreign private investments with Reuters on Wednesday, declined to name any company but said global firms were increasingly attracted to Malaysia for its stable business and political climate.
In the first six months of the year, Malaysia approved U.S. investment proposals worth 11.69 billion ringgit in the manufacturing sector, compared with 307 million ringgit a year earlier, replacing China at the top of the investment list.
Malaysia already hosts manufacturing plants of U.S. companies such as  Intel Corp  (O:INTC), Dell Technologies Inc (N:DELL) and On Semiconductor Corp (O:ON).
Proposed U.S. investment in the service sector soared to 11.52 billion ringgit from just 42.3 million in the year-ago period, the data showed.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's Royal Bank of Scotland (L:RBS) may have to shell out a further 900 million pounds ($1.1 billion) to settle a final compensation bill for mis-selling payment protection insurance after a last-minute surge in customer claims.
The state-backed bank said on Wednesday it had made an additional provision of 600-900 million pounds, on top of the 5.3 billion pounds already set aside, after claims received in August exceeded expectations.
The news gives credence to recent comments by industry experts that Britain's most costly consumer banking scandal could yet have a sting in the tail even after an August 29 deadline for claiming compensation.
Separately on Wednesday, rival Clydesdale Bank (L:CYBGC) (CYBG), which also owns the Yorkshire Bank and Virgin Money (LON:VM) brands, said it had also received ""unprecedented volumes"" of requests for information from customers in the run-up to the complaints deadline.
CYBG said it could take several months before determining the quality of the complaints received and the potential related financial impact but it would look to provide the market with an initial cost estimate, which it described as ""material"".
British banks have so far paid out more than 36 billion pounds to consumers eight years after it first emerged they were mis-sold the loans insurance on a vast scale.
PPI policies were sold alongside a personal loan or mortgage to cover repayments if borrowers fell ill or lost jobs but most were sold unsuitable policies.
RBS said 4.9 billion pounds of its total provisions had already been utilised.
People were bombarded with commercials and advertisements pushing them to make last minute PPI claims to their banks.
One such campaign was financed by Britain's banking regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority and fronted by U.S. actor-turned-politician Arnold Schwarzenegger.
RBS's new provision will be reflected in the third-quarter results, the bank said, adding that the processing of PPI claims were ongoing and the ultimate provision recognised could be above or below the 600-900 million pounds range.
Analysts at Investec described the RBS provision as a ""horrific finish to the PPI saga"".
""RBS has had more limited exposure to PPI relative to its domestic peers, in the context of which today's announcement ... is all the more shocking,"" Investec's Ian Gordon said."

KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysia's former leader Najib Razak approved a plan to bail out troubled state fund 1MDB by offering stakes in several big infrastructure projects to Chinese firms in 2016, a former aide told a court on Wednesday.
Najib, who was voted out of power last year amid public anger over alleged graft at 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB), is on trial for allegedly receiving hundreds of millions of dollars from the state fund he set up in 2009.
He has pleaded not guilty.
Former special officer Amhari Effendi Nazaruddin said Najib sent him to China in June 2016 on a ""secret mission"" to reaffirm economic ties and investments between the two countries.
The talking points prepared for his meeting with Chinese officials showed there were plans to use Chinese investments to help pay off the debts of 1MDB and its former unit, SRC International, Amhari told the Kuala Lumpur High Court.
""The phrase 'while simultaneously completely resolving 1MDB and SRC debts' clearly meant that Najib intended to send the message that this cooperation would aid 1MDB and SRC International through the bailout of 1MDB's debts,"" Amhari said, referring to the talking points.
China has denied reports that its officials had offered to bail out 1MDB in 2016, saying it never attaches political conditions to its cooperation with other countries.
Amhari said among the deals offered to Chinese companies to fund the bailout were two pipeline projects and the $20 billion East Coast Rail Link (ECRL), a major part of China's Belt and Road initiative.
The pipeline projects were later canceled and the cost of the railway project nearly halved to $11 billion after Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad took over last year.
Mahathir, who swiftly reopened probes into 1MDB, has said investigators are looking into whether a $2.3 billion loan from the Export-Import Bank of China for the two pipeline projects was used to repay 1MDB debts.
China Communications Construction Co. Ltd, the lead contractor for the ECRL project, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Amhari's testimony.
Amhari said his talking points were prepared by fugitive Malaysian financier Low Taek Jho, or Jho Low, who attended the meeting with Chinese officials as a translator.
Low, who faces charges in the United States and Malaysia over his alleged central role in the 1MDB scandal, has denied wrongdoing. His whereabouts are unknown. 
""In summary, based on the situation that had unfolded and the documents prepared by Jho Low, I believe that Najib had knowledge and had given the mandate to Jho Low to plan and manage efforts to bail out 1MDB and SRC from its losses and debts,"" Amhari said. 
Malaysian and U.S. investigators say that at least $4.5 billion was misappropriated from 1MDB by Low and other high-level officials of the fund and their associates. 

Najib's trial continues on Thursday.

China’s weight will be capped at 10% of the GBI-EM global diversified and narrow diversified indexes. The inclusion will begin Feb. 28, 2020, the bank said in a statement Wednesday.  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). analysts earlier estimated that such a move could lead to about $3 billion of inflows into China’s bond market a month.
China has steadily opened access to its onshore debt, and in April the country’s domestic bonds began a phased-in inclusion in the Bloomberg  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Global Aggregate Index. Bloomberg LP is the owner of that bond index, and also owns Bloomberg News.
A third index provider, FTSE Russell, is scheduled to announce its decisions regarding changes in its WGBI gauge later this month. Goldman calculated that FTSE Russell inclusion of Chinese bonds could see $6 billion to $7.5 billion a month in extra inflows from overseas. Last month, overseas investors bought 25 billion yuan ($3.5 billion) of onshore Chinese bonds, according to ChinaBond data -- even as the yuan posted its biggest monthly decline since the 1990s.
Some $202 billion of assets track the GBI-EM global diversified benchmark, according to JPMorgan. China inclusion will take 10 months, with a 1% addition per month, the bank said. JPMorgan will construct indexes that exclude China “to provide investors with alternatives as required,” the bank said.
“The pace of capital inflows into the onshore bond market will accelerate, with more passive funds buying the debt and some others betting on a narrowing of the now wide China-U.S. interest-rate gap,” said Zhaopeng Xing, a markets economist at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd.

753,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 04, 2019 06:36AM ET</span>",Share index relegation a sign of the times for once mighty M&S,"By James Davey
LONDON (Reuters) - Marks & Spencer (L:MKS) chairman Archie Norman has said he is unperturbed by the British retailer's share price slide, with his focus on the long term, but relegation from the prestigious FTSE 100 index is a symbol of its decline.
The 135-year-old food and clothing high street retailer, known affectionately as ""Marks and Sparks"", has been in the blue-chip index (FTSE) since its launch in 1984, but its shares have slid 36% over the last year as investors lost faith after a decade of failed reinventions and three years of profit falls.
M&S will be ejected in a quarterly reshuffle of the London index, according to Reuters calculations based on Tuesday's closing share price of 187 pence, which gave it a market value of 3.64 billion pounds ($4.5 billion).
""It is a reflection of the times. High Street retailers have been struggling for some time and M&S continues to look for that balance between quality and price,"" Adrian Lowcock, head of personal investing at Willis Owen, said.
FTSE Russell, the index provider, will confirm M&S's exit after the end of trading on Wednesday, with the change taking effect on Sept. 23.
Though largely symbolic, this will see M&S sold by funds which seek to replicate the FTSE 100 by buying its constituents. It would, however, be bought by FTSE 250-tracker funds.
M&S, which is not scheduled to update the market until it publishes financial results on Nov. 6, declined to comment.
Founded in 1884 on a market stall in northern England, M&S flourished in the second half of the 20th century, bringing innovations to Britain such as ladder-resistant stockings and avocados. In 1998 it became the first British retailer to make more than a billion pounds of annual profit.
For older Britons, M&S was the obvious place to buy basics such as socks and underwear, as well as more formal shirts, suits for work and comfortable sweaters for the weekends - all sold under the St Michael brand.
Its painful decline reflects an inability to effectively compete on clothing with the likes of Zara and H&M.
It has built up a well regarded food business that seeks to combine convenience and indulgence. That now accounts for more than half of its annual revenue but margins have come under pressure from the march of discount chains.
LATEST PLAN
M&S set out on its latest turnaround plan shortly after retail veteran Norman became chairman in 2017 to work alongside Steve Rowe, who has been with the company for three decades and became its chief executive in 2016.
Norman made his name turning around supermarket group Asda (N:WMT) in the 1990s and latterly broadcaster  ITV  (L:ITV).
He said in May last year that M&S was targeting sustainable, profitable growth in three to five years and has been instrumental in speeding-up the pace of change, with the firm closing weaker stores, revamping ranges and investing online.
His boldest move yet was striking a 1.5 billion pound joint venture with online grocer Ocado (L:OCDO) to give M&S a home delivery service for food.
But that decision has not convinced everyone.
Simon Gergel, chief investment officer UK equities at Allianz (DE:ALVG) Global Investors, sold his holding in M&S this year on concern over the Ocado tie-up and a change to the food strategy.
""We had seen a lot of value in M&S because of its very strong cash flow and what we felt was a fairly resilient but niche food business. It became clear they had a strategy to have a much broader food offering, including an online presence,"" he said.
""It would take quite a lot to change for us to want to get involved.""
At its annual meeting in July, M&S highlighted improving food sales and enhanced clothing ranges. But it also noted continuing failures in product availability - a factor in the sacking of clothing boss Jill McDonald days later.
For Norman, dropping out of the FTSE 100 will not be a new challenge, and when asked in May 2018 about the prospect of relegation he said it was ""of no interest"", adding he would look at the M&S share price in three to five years time.
And this May he told reporters:
“When I went to ITV we dropped out of the FTSE 100, the sky didn’t fall in. The business was the same business the day after.”"

Investing.com -- Europe’s stock markets were again in the thrall of politics Wednesday, but this time they’re being driven sharply higher.
By 4:50 AM ET (0850 GMT), the benchmark Euro Stoxx 600 was up 1.1%, its highest in over a month. The German DAX was up 1.3%, back above 12,000 for the first time since Aug. 1, while France’s CAC 40 was up 1.2%.
The wave that lifted all boats was a report in the South China Morning Post saying that the embattled head of Hong Kong’s legislature, Carrie Lam, is about to withdraw a controversial bill that sparked what is now three months of protests.
The news was a particular boon to luxury goods companies, which derive a disproportional amount of their revenues and profits from Hong Kong’s boutiques, and which cited the protests as hitting their performance in the last quarter. French-based   Kering   (PA:PRTP), the owner of Gucci, rose 3.7%, while LVMH (PA:LVMH) rose 3.4%. U.K.-listed   Burberry   (LON:BRBY) gained 3.6%, while Italy’s Moncler (MI:MONC) and Salvatore Ferragamo (MI:SFER) rose 3.5% and 2.7%, respectively. Switzerland’s   Richemont   (SIX:CFR) rose 3.9%.
Asia-focused banks also stood out in London, with HSBC (LON:HSBA) rising 2.1% and   Standard Chartered   (LON:STAN) rising 3.6%.
More localized support came from the U.K., where parliamentary opponents of a No Deal Brexit won a motion late on Tuesday to wrest control of the House of Commons agenda, effectively wrecking Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s tactics for extracting last-minute compromises from the EU on life after Brexit. The U.K. FTSE 100 was one of the worst-performing indexes in Europe on Wednesday, as a 1.5% surge in sterling hit the multinational components of the index, but still rose 0.8%.
The biggest outperformer was again Italy, where the FTSE MIB 30 rose 1.6% after the members of the Five Star Movement voted to support a deal with the center-left Democratic Party to form a new government.
Even so, it may be too early to get the champagne out. The developments – all three of them positive at first glance – have their shadows. There was no mention of whether Lam had sought or received Beijing’s blessing for her climbdown. That means the threat of more forceful intervention has not been banished.
Secondly, Prime Minister Johnson responded to his defeat by saying he wants a general election, which on the evidence of the past three years – and current opinion polls - is no guarantee of an end to the whole Brexit psychodrama.
Thirdly, the tensions between the members of Italy’s new coalition are so obvious and ingrained that it seems unlikely the government will last much longer than any other of its 70 predecessors since the Second World War. 
However, those all seem like being problems for another day."
755,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 04, 2019 06:11AM ET</span>",Labor pains: Japanese jobs for South Korean graduates dry up amid trade row,"By Joori Roh
SEOUL (Reuters) - Song Min-su, a Japanese major in his final year at Hannam University, south of Seoul, has watched in dismay as a spat between South Korea and Japan over wartime forced labor has spiraled into a damaging political and economic row.
Song, 25, has been pursuing his dream of working in Japan. With historic labor shortages in Japan, he had been confident he would avoid the tough job search many of his peers faced at home in South Korea, where youth unemployment is growing.
But Japanese curbs on the exports of high-tech materials to South Korea has escalated a bitter diplomatic feud between the neighbors, sparking boycotts that have hit the sales of Japanese cars, beer and other goods in South Korea, as well as travel to Japan.
""It will not only get harder to find a job in Japan, but the current sentiment will also make things more difficult to find a job in Korea with the use of my Japanese major,"" Song said.
South Korea has long had testy relations with former colonial ruler Japan, with Tokyo citing a dispute over forced labor during World War Two as a factor that led to tighter export controls implemented in July.
South Korea responded by stripping Japan of favored trading nation status and scrapping an intelligence sharing pact.
The dispute has derailed a surge in hiring of highly educated South Korean graduates by Japanese companies in recent years, forcing job seekers, employment consultants and the Seoul government to rethink Japan as a place to work.
That has piled more pressure on South Korean President Moon Jae-In, who came to power in 2017 on promises to create jobs and address inequality.
Nearly 10% of South Koreans aged 15 to 29 were jobless in July, according to Statistics Korea, but the department says the real rate be as high as 24% including those with temporary or part-time jobs, who gave up looking for jobs or who are preparing for state examinations.
Employment growth in South Korea has been sluggish as conglomerates that dominate the economy have slowed hiring due to a sharp rise in minimum wages and a cooling economy, especially in the manufacturing and construction industries.
Japan, with unemployment at a 26-year-low, was the most popular overseas place to work for Koreans in 2014 and 2016-2018, data from Human Resources Development Service of Korea shows.
Japan was the destination for nearly one-third of the 5,783 South Korean graduates who found jobs overseas last year under government programs, more than triple the number in 2013.
NO SHOW
But last month, the Labor Ministry canceled a job fair focused on Japan and Southeast Asia for late September that would have been the largest organized by the government, blaming the strained ties.
Another job expo held by the Korea-Japan Cooperation Foundation for Industry and Technology in mid-July, also with a focus on jobs in Japan, received 20% fewer participants than its previous fairs, an official told Reuters.
South Korea's Labor Ministry is planning the second of its bi-annual global job fairs in November, but instead of focusing on jobs in Japan as it did last year, it plans to broaden the list of countries.
Japanese employers made up 115 of the 184 companies that took part last time.
Some private job fair organizers say public sentiment on Japan is souring as the dispute drags on and local media highlight negative comments by Japanese leaders.
""I recently received a few calls from my students that they decided to no longer look for jobs in Japan,"" said Kasugai Moe, CEO of KOREC, a recruiting agency specializing in Japan. Some students said their parents had disapproved of them seeking jobs in Japan, she added.
KOREC has decided to scrap its next job fair scheduled for later this month.
Park Cheol-su, head of the careers office at Hannam University, said while he routinely hosted 10 or more Japanese companies for on-site recruiting each year, he has not heard from any companies in recent weeks.
""(The Japan export curb issue) definitely seems to be affecting these events,"" Park said.
Japanese employers are worried candidates who have accepted job offers might change their minds, according to a Korea International Trade Association (KITA) official speaking on condition of anonymity.
South Korea plans to turn elsewhere to promote jobs for its youth. KITA held its first Germany-focused job fair in late August.
Song, the Japanese major, says he will keep looking for jobs in Japan but is also keeping his eyes open for opportunities at home.
""Boycott is a matter of individual choice, but employment is a bread-and-butter issue,"" he said."

The casino will be part of a planned 8 billion-euro ($8.97 billion) resort known as Hellenikon, built by developer Lamda (AT:LMDr) on the site of Athens' disused Hellenikon airport, with the backing of Chinese and Gulf funds.
For the past 18 years the old Hellenikon terminals have stood abandoned on a sprawling wasteland three times the size of Monaco, along with derelict water sport venues used for the Athens 2004 Olympics.
Lamda plans to build one of Europe’s biggest coastal resorts, covering 620 hectares (1,532 acres). The project, part of a post-bailout agreement between Greece and its lenders, has faced bureaucratic delays in recent years amid a long-running row with critics who fear it will damage the environment and the country's cultural heritage.
But a new conservative government has stepped up the licensing process since taking office in July and want to conclude it by the end of the year.
Greece has set an Oct. 4 bid deadline in a tender for the construction and 30-year operation of the casino.
""We want to develop an integrated tourism and entertainment complex that is much more than just a box with slot machines and gaming tables. Entertainment is at the heart of our philosophy"", Chairman Jim Allen told Kathimerini newspaper.
""In our estimate, the whole investment will be significantly higher than 1 billion euros,"" he said, adding that 60 percent of the investment will be financed from bank loans and the rest from equity, probably with the participation of local partners.
The country saw record tourist arrivals in 2018 of 33 million people and expects a similar number this year. Hellenikon is expected to bring in hundreds of thousands of tourists every year, a significant boost to the country's economy which has been recovering after a multi-year debt crisis.
Allen said Athens has been one of the top urban destinations in the world, combining ancient culture with sea and sunshine.
U.S. casino operator Mohegan Gaming & Entertainment and Greek contractor GEK Terna (AT:HRMr) have also announced their intention to jointly bid for the casino license."

U.K. retailers may see their earnings tumble as much as 30% in the event of a no-deal Brexit, according to  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C).
The companies may have to revisit their guidance in the event that the U.K. leaves the European Union without a deal, meaning earnings per share could be cut by between 5% and 30%, the broker said.
“A number of retailers have based their outlook on an orderly Brexit or made no assumptions given the uncertainty,” Citigroup analyst Adam Cochrane wrote in a note Wednesday. “At the very least there will be margin headwinds from the weaker sterling and the risk to consumption looks skewed to the downside that is not currently reflected.”
The FTSE 350 General Retailers Index has fallen 24% since the Brexit referendum in June 2016 as consumers curtailed spending amid uncertainty about how the economy would fare.
Homewares seller Dunelm Group Plc said Wednesday it remains cautious about the full-year outlook “due to increased Brexit uncertainty and specifically the impact it may have on consumer spending as we enter our peak period.” Car-parts and bicycles seller Halfords Group Plc said it expects “economic and political uncertainty will continue to impact big-ticket discretionary spend” during the second half of the year."

The volume of customer claims received during August was significantly higher than expected, with a further spike in the days leading up to a deadline of Aug. 29, according to a statement from the firm.
British lenders have spent the past eight years compensating customers who were mis-sold payment protection insurance they didn’t want or need. The policies, some of which dated back decades, were intended to cover missed debt repayments and were often sold using aggressive tactics. In the worst cases, banks misled customers by telling them that PPI was mandatory for loans.
RBS said the preliminary range for the latest provision is between 600 million pounds and 900 million pounds. “The processing of claims is ongoing and the ultimate provision recognized could be above or below this range,” the state-controlled lender said. The provision will be booked in the third quarter. RBS shares rose 1.2% in early trading Wednesday, broadly in line with other U.K. banks.
The news comes at a challenging time for RBS as it searches for a replacement for outgoing Chief Executive Officer Ross McEwan. The bank is also contending with the uncertainty of Brexit and blamed an “uncertain and competitive environment” last quarter for net interest income that missed analysts’ estimates.
In July Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LON:LLOY), the country’s biggest mortgage lender, took a similar charge as customers rushed to meet the deadline for claiming compensation. Banks paid 35.7 billion pounds to PPI customers between January 2011 and May this year, according to the Financial Conduct Authority.

MILAN (Reuters) - Britain's pound bounced from three-year lows on Wednesday after a parliamentary vote raised the prospect of another delay to Brexit while an easing of worries about political risk in Italy also helped push world stocks higher. 
Global stocks rose 0.4% by 0821 GMT, as Europe rallied 1.1% and after a positive session in Asia following a report showing that growth in China's service sector accelerated despite broader economic headwinds.
Reports that Hong Kong will announce the withdrawal of an extradition bill that triggered months of unrest, throwing the Chinese-ruled city into its worst crisis in decades, also caused relief.
British lawmakers defeated Boris Johnson on Tuesday in a bid to prevent him taking Britain out of the European Union without a divorce agreement, prompting the prime minister to announce that he would immediately push for a snap election.
On Wednesday they will seek to pass a law forcing Johnson to ask the European Union to delay Brexit until Jan. 31 unless he has an exit deal approved by parliament beforehand.
UK developments lifted the pound 0.56% to $1.2155 after sliding on Tuesday to its lowest since October 2016. 
""The road from here is likely to be very tricky, especially if PM Boris Johnson takes the path toward a snap election,"" said Hussein Sayed, Chief Market Strategist at FXTM.
""However, Mr. Johnson needs at least two-thirds of MPs to vote in favor of one, and so far, the Labor party doesn't seem willing to take this risk. If the opposition party manages to get Brexit delayed in the outcome of no deal, we can see sterling recover further from here,"" he added.
Elsewhere in currency markets, the dollar index against a basket of six major currencies stood at 98.803 after rising overnight to 99.370, its highest level since May 2017.
The index lost ground on Tuesday after data showed the U.S. manufacturing sector contracted in August for the first time since 2016, a reading that in turn has cemented expectations of further policy easing by the Federal Reserve. 
The euro rose to $1.0987 after sliding to a 28-month low of $1.0926 overnight as investors braced for a potential interest rate cut by the European Central Bank next week. 
ITALIAN YIELDS AT NEW LOWS
In Italy, members of the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement backed a proposed coalition with the center-left Democratic Party on Tuesday, opening the way for a new government to take office in the coming days. 
As a result 10-year Italian government bond yields hit 0.803%, a new record low, while Italian banks, another proxy for political risk in the country, rallied 2%. 
""The next hurdle for the government will be the confidence vote in Parliament. But at the moment risks appear limited,"" said Giuseppe Sersale, fund manager at Anthilia Capital.
Political concerns and expectations of further easing measures by central banks have been squeezing bond yields globally but the return of risk appetite on Wednesday on the back of political developments in Europe and upbeat economic data from China triggered a rebound.
Yields on the safe-haven 10-year German Bund rose to 0.676% after falling to a fresh record low on Tuesday, while the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury rose to 1.489% after hitting its lowest since July 2016 in the previous session in light of the weak ISM U.S. factories reading. 
In commodities, oil prices recovered some ground, helped by the positive China data and having touched their lowest in close to a month during the previous session on fears over the weakening global economy.
Brent crude was up 22 cents at $58.48 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate futures gained 31 cents at $54.25 at barrel.

London copper prices rebounded from a two-year low and gold prices steadied.

Few economists believe another cut at this level would actually help the economy, and clients are telling the bank they won’t invest a single euro more just because rates go 10 basis points lower, Sewing said at a conference in Frankfurt. All it would achieve is to further divide society by lifting asset prices while punishing Europe’s savers who are already paying 160 billion euros ($176 billion) a year because of negative interest rates, he said.
“In the long run, negative rates ruin the financial system,” the CEO said at the event, organized by the Handelsblatt newspaper. Another cut “may make refinancing cheaper for states, but has grave side effects.”
The comments are Sewing’s most vocal criticism yet of a monetary policy that has left Europe’s banks in general -- and Deutsche Bank in particular -- struggling to compete with Wall Street firms, by eroding revenue from lending and burdening them with billions of euros in penalties for parking cash with the central bank. Sewing in July announced radical cuts to his firm, including the loss of 18,000 jobs, after years of revenue contraction and low profitability pushed the shares to a record low.
The ECB will decide next week if it will cut its interest rates even further as a slew of economic indicators have recently showed a decelerating economy. Many banks have said they oppose further cuts and want any such move to be tempered with exemptions, a process known as tiering.
“What’s really worrisome: central banks have hardly any tools left to effectively mitigate a real economic crisis,” Sewing said. “They have already cranked open the money tap -- most of all the European Central Bank.”
Sewing said his bank had asked 285 corporate clients about the impact of another rate cut by the ECB."

The resignation of Slosar, 63, follows the departure of CEO Rupert Hogg last month, after the Chinese aviation regulator increased scrutiny on the airline and its staff members following anti-government protests in Hong Kong.
Hogg was replaced by Augustus Tang, who had previously headed Swire's aircraft maintenance company.
The departure of Slosar, a former Cathay CEO, and the appointment of Healy will take effect at Cathay's annual meeting on Nov. 6, the carrier said in a statement.
In a filing to the stock exchange, Cathay said Slosar ""confirmed that his resignation is due to his retirement and that he is not aware of any disagreement with the Board of the Company.""
The airline has become the biggest corporate casualty of the protests after China demanded it suspend staff involved in, or who support, the demonstrations that have plunged the former British colony into a political crisis.

It is the latest action by Malaysian authorities seeking to recover billions of dollars allegedly stolen from 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB). Malaysian and U.S. investigators believe about $4.5 billion was misappropriated from 1MDB by top officials of the fund and associates between 2009 and 2014.
The 4 billion ringgit was disbursed by 1MDB unit SRC International and used around the world, Finance Minister Lim Guan Eng said.
""The government through SRC is in the midst of pursuing civil action toward that purpose and will work with the relevant authorities to track the money,"" he said in a statement.
BSI Bank in Switzerland, Bank Julius Baer & Co Ltd in Hong Kong and a Mongolian coal exploration company are among the firms that received the funds from SRC, Lim said.
The 4 billion ringgit disbursed by SRC was borrowed from Malaysia's retirement fund, Kumpulan Wang Persaraan, and any recovered monies will be returned to the fund, Lim said.
The finance ministry took over SRC from 1MDB in 2012.
Former Prime Minister Najib Razak has been charged with 42 criminal offences related to losses at 1MDB and other state entities. He has consistently denied wrongdoing.
Prosecutors last week wrapped up their case in the first trial against Najib, in which he is accused of illegally receiving $10 million from SRC. 

Najib has pleaded not guilty to all the charges.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - China's Huawei Technologies on Tuesday said the U.S. government had instructed law enforcement to ""coerce"" and ""entice"" its employees to turn against the company, as it steps up its pushback against a U.S. campaign that could threaten its survival.
Huawei made its assertions in a news release on Tuesday and in an undated document seen by Reuters.
Amid a trade war with China, Washington put the world's No. 2 smartphone maker on an Entity List in May, in effect cutting off its access to essential U.S. components and technology, in particular Google's (O:GOOGL) apps and services for Android devices.
Huawei on Tuesday said the U.S. government was using its judicial and administrative powers as well as other means to disrupt its business and that of its partners.
A Justice Department spokesman said that while they do not comment on specific investigations, ""in all matters, our investigative techniques comply with the law and all subjects of investigations enjoy the same rights to due process afforded by our Constitution and safeguarded by an independent judiciary.""
Huawei said in its public statement that staff and Huawei partners were subjected to unlawful searches, detention and arrest while some employees were visited by FBI agents at their homes and pressured to collect information on the company.
According to the Huawei document, eight employees, several of them U.S. citizens, were involved in the incidents. All of them are mid- to high-level executives. The latest incident happened on Aug. 28 when an employee from Huawei's U.S. office informed the company of a visit from the FBI asking the person to be an informant.
The Justice Department said the FBI would not have a separate comment.
Speaking in Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang referred specific questions to the Huawei statement, but said China opposed U.S. moves to target a specific company without providing any evidence.
""This kind of behavior is not only disgraceful, it is also immoral,"" Geng said, adding that the United States should stop its ""irrational"" pressure on Chinese companies and instead create a non-discriminatory environment for their operations. 
Huawei did not provide any evidence for its accusations, saying that their employees had reported them to the company. Reuters could not independently confirm the information provided by Huawei.
Since the start of this year, at least three U.S. employees have been contacted by U.S. law enforcement agencies, the Huawei document said.
Beyond the accusations of putting pressure on its employees, Huawei also claimed that the U.S. government was launching cyber attacks on the company and mobilizing companies that work with Huawei to bring unsubstantiated accusations. The document did not provide specific details about these efforts.
The company also accused U.S. authorities of selectively launching criminal investigations based on civil cases that have already been settled and filing criminal charges based on claims of technology theft.

""The fact remains that none of Huawei's core technology has been the subject of any criminal case brought against the company, and none of the accusations levied by the U.S. government have been supported with sufficient evidence,"" the company said.

These are hard times for an area dependent on the fortunes of companies like Maruti Suzuki (NS:MRTI), the carmaker with the largest market share in India, and motorbike maker Honda Motor Co's (T:7267) local unit. The auto and component makers in and around Manesar, have shed thousands of jobs.
Nationwide, according to industry estimates, automakers, component manufacturers and dealers have laid off about 350,000 workers since the start of the year, in response to plunging car sales. Figures for August, like July, are expected to show a drop of more than 30%, making a 10th straight month of decline.
As the crisis in the sector bites harder small businesses in the towns and villages around Manesar, home to one of the three plants where Maruti Suzuki cars are made, have seen a fall off in trade.
""There are already fewer workers in the village and those who still have jobs are either not getting paid for working overtime or are not spending as much out of fear they may lose work and need the money,"" said grocer Rahul Jain, his shelves stacked with toothpaste and soaps from fast-moving consumer goods companies like  Hindustan Unilever  (NS:HLL), Colgate-Palmolive (NS:COLG) and  Dabur India  (NS:DABU).
Even sales of products like cooking oil and flour have fallen. On the lower rungs of the service sector, barbers and tea stall owners said they had fewer customers.
Shoe seller Subhay Singh, in Manesar's Aliyar village, has days when he doesn't make a single sale.
""My monthly earnings have halved,"" said Singh, who a year ago made an average 8,000 rupees a day. ""I don't know what's happening.""
In the United States there was an old adage: ""When General Motors (NYSE:GM) sneezes, the Wall Street catches a cold."" In India, the impact goes well beyond the stock market.
India's automotive industry is the fourth largest in the world, employing more than 35 million people, directly and indirectly, and accounting for nearly half of India's manufacturing output.
The industry has three main centers; Gurugram in the North, Chennai in the South, where among others Ford Motor (N:F) and  Hyundai Motor  (KS:005380) have plants, and Pune in the West, where Tata Motors (NS:TAMO) and  Fiat  (MI:FCHA) are located.
All of them are hurting, and the pain is radiating outwards.
NEEDING A HAIRCUT
Before suffering the steepening slump in sales, the auto industry provided one of the few bright spots for manufacturing. Its troubles stem in part from banks' and non-banking finance houses' reluctance to extend consumer loans, as well as subdued demand, particularly in the countryside, where two-thirds of Indians live.
Laid-off workers returning to their villages are now putting more burden on a rural sector already suffering falling income from low crop prices, and dampening consumer sentiment and growth across the country.
Gurmeet Singh had been earning 10,000 rupees a month until he lost his job at auto component maker Bellsonica in Manesar. Six months later, back in his hometown of Ambala in Haryana state, Singh is still looking for a job, and catastrophising about the future.
""I haven't had a hair cut in months, my shoes are torn and I've been using the same pair of clothes since I lost my job. Only I know how I am surviving,"" said the 26-year-old.
""If I don't get a job, how will I build a house for my family, get married and pay off the loan my parents took to educate me?"" he said.
His bleak outlook reflects an increasingly grim big picture. India's economic growth slipped to a six-year low of 5% in the April-June quarter and Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who was re-elected to a second term in a landslide in May, is under pressure to provide a stimulus for an economy that is seriously undershooting the growth rate needed to generate enough jobs for the millions of young Indians entering the labor market every month.
RESISTING A BISCUIT
All this is cast against a backdrop of a weakening world economy, and uncertainties arising from the trade war between the United States and China.
Things are so manifestly bad that even one of the nation's most popular biscuitmakers, Parle Products Private Limited, is worried about the impact of the auto industry's troubles on sales.
""If the economy is buoyant then even the rural consumer will not mind paying a little extra. But this (slowdown) has acted as a catalyst to the drop in demand,"" said Mayank Shah, product category head at Parle.
 Britannia Industries  Ltd (NS:BRIT), which controls a third of the biscuits market in India, said it has ""never seen this kind of a slowdown"" where people are hesitant to buy a pack of biscuits costing just 5 rupees ($0.07).
""If the consumer is thinking twice before buying, then obviously, there is some serious issue in the economy,"" Varun Berry, the company's managing director told analysts in a post-earnings call last month.
Under pressure from businesses and investors to provide more stimulus, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman proposed a series of measures last month to help the economy and financial markets but some economists said it would not be enough to revive long-term demand.
On Aug 23, foreign investment rules were eased for several sectors, and sources say the government is expected to come up with more measures such as tax cuts for autos and real estate.
""The real revenue growth for auto and consumer goods sectors started declining nearly two years ago. The slowdown has merely gained prominence now,"" said Arindam Som, analyst at India Ratings, a Fitch group company, adding that he expects auto companies to further cut production.
A year ago, Vinod Chauhan had no vacancies at all in the 70 rooms he leased primarily to migrant workers in Manesar's Kasan village. Today, over a third of those rooms are vacant and Chauhan fears things could get worse before they get better.
His son won't be getting the new car that Chauhan planned to buy him this year, and the landlord has also shelved plans to build another 100 hostel apartments.
""If I am not able to rent out all the rooms I currently have, how will I manage with more?"" said Chauhan."

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Some Chinese business sectors reported solid first half earnings, though a substantial fall in industrial profits and in tepid overseas investment inflows into China's stock markets show fallout from the protracted trade war with the United States.
Foreign portfolio inflows into stocks in the world's second largest economy have slowed dramatically. Stocks exposed to overseas markets and a weaker yuan have seen sustained selling while companies in the consumer and technology sectors have seen share prices rise as Beijing boosts domestic consumption and seeks technological independence.
GRAPHIC: Foreign inflows decreased significantly amid trade tensions - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/buzzifr/14/5101/5101/Foreign%20inflows%20decreased%20significantly%20amid%20trade%20tensions.png
Inflows in January-August via the Stock Connect scheme with Hong Kong were about 120 billion yuan ($16.92 billion). That topped the year-earlier number, but was a fraction of the 600 billion yuan of 2019 inflows the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) expressed hope for at beginning of the year.
Global index provider MSCI is quadrupling the weighting of Chinese mainland shares in its global benchmarks this year, while FTSE Russell began adding China A-shares to its main emerging markets index in June.
But industrial profits have slowed since 2018's second half as economic growth slipped to a near 30-year low.

Shares in machinery, electronics and home appliances firms, seen as vulnerable to trade tensions given their reliance on overseas markets, have been under selling pressure.
BOE Technology (SZ:000725) is an example. The OLED display panel maker, which saw first-half profits plunge 44%, said it faced extremely severe challenges due to trade frictions and an industry downturn.
As the trade war pushed the yuan to an 11-year low, it hurt companies sensitive to currency moves, including real estate firms and airlines. The CSI300 real estate index dropped 7.1% in August as a weakening yuan made the property market less desirable for foreign investors.

Consumer firms were among China's better performing sectors as Beijing rolled out measures to stimulate China’s domestic consumption. Market bellwether Kweichow  Moutai  (SS:600519), a famous liquor maker, reported 27% profit growth.
To offset effects of the trade war, Chinese policymakers rolled out measures including tax cuts and lower reserve requirements for banks, which were pushed to lend to smaller companies.

CHICAGO (Reuters) - The head of the International Air Transport Association (IATA) warned on Tuesday that any discrepancy among global regulators over reapproving Boeing Co's (N:BA) 737 MAX for commercial flight could set a worrying precedent for future aircraft programs.
The 737 MAX, Boeing's newest single-aisle aircraft, was grounded worldwide in March after two deadly crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia within five months. Boeing is updating flight control software at the center of both crashes that must be approved by regulators before the planes can fly commercially again.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has traditionally taken the lead on certifying Boeing aircraft, leaving other regulators globally to follow suit. That process has been supported by IATA, a trade association of the world's airlines.
But international regulators have indicated they will pursue their own analysis of the 737 MAX and Boeing's proposed updates, after the FAA suffered a dent to its credibility following 737 MAX crashes.
""With the 737 MAX we are a bit worried ... because we don't see the normal unanimity among international regulators that should be the case,"" Alexandre de Juniac, IATA director general, told reporters ahead of a summit in Chicago. 
""We see a discrepancy that's detrimental to the industry,"" he added, urging regulators to make any changes to the single certification process ""collectively.""
In an emailed statement, the FAA said it has a ""transparent and collaborative relationship"" with other civil aviation authorities, but ""each government will make its own decision to return the aircraft to service based on a thorough safety assessment.""
In a presentation to the European Parliament transport committee on Tuesday, European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) Executive Director Patrick Ky said the regional regulator has around 20 experts, including test pilots and engineers, examining the 737 MAX design to ensure there were no weaknesses in safety critical areas.
Presentation slides posted on the European Parliament website showed that of the latest solutions presented by Boeing, EASA was satisfied with changes to the flight control computer architecture and believed improved crew procedures and training were a work in progress. However, it noted there was still no appropriate response to issues with the integrity of the angle of attack system. 
In both of the 737 MAX crashes, erroneous data to one of the angle of attack sensors led to the activation of an automated system that repeatedly pushed down the plane's nose. 
U.S. airlines are drawing up flight schedules without the 737 MAX into December or early next year, taking a financial hit while the jets remain grounded.
Boeing is targeting regulatory approval for the fixes and new pilot training in October, though the FAA reiterated on Tuesday it does not have a firm timeline to put the jets back in the air.
""Our first priority is safety, and we have set no timeframe for when the work will be completed,"" it said.

CHICAGO (Reuters) - This summer, U.S. airlines have enjoyed booming flight demand, immune to a Swedish-born ""flight shaming"" movement that has hit air travel in Europe, where environmentally conscious travelers are choosing trains over planes.
But the head of global lobby International Air Transport Association (IATA) says the environmental challenge, which he called the biggest threat to the airline industry in Europe, ""will probably come to other parts of the world, especially North America.""
""If you believe or think that the environmental concern is a world concern touching everyone on the planet (...) there's no reason to believe that other young people won't react,"" Alexandre de Juniac told journalists on Tuesday.
De Juniac later acknowledged to Reuters that the lack of a viable train alternative in the United States was a big hurdle to a U.S. movement, but noted the rise of progressives promoting plans like the Green New Deal, which includes investment in high-speed rail.
The movement will spread in the United States and then move on to advanced countries in Asia like Korea and Japan, de Juniac predicted.
The more anti-aviation sentiment grows, the more eager governments are to tax the industry, he said.
In July, France announced a tax on airlines flying from its airports to help support the environment, a move that Air France said would significantly hurt its competitiveness and add over 60 million euros in additional costs per year.
Commercial flying accounts for about 2.5% of global carbon emissions today but without concrete steps to alleviate the problem, that number could rise as global air travel increases.
The aviation industry has already cut carbon emissions from each plane traveler in half since 1990, largely thanks to more fuel-efficient aircraft, and has a plan to cut net emissions by 2050 and achieve carbon-neutral growth from 2020.
The challenge now is to enforce and implement the goals, and win over the sentiment of a portion of the flying public that de Juniac said wants to be reassured that the industry is ""doing the right things.""
Activists advocating for zero-carbon travel are increasingly passionate and effective. In August, Swedish teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg crossed the Atlantic in a racing yacht to avoid traveling by air to take part in a U.N. summit."
775,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 03, 2019 09:32PM ET</span>",Exclusive: OxyContin maker prepares 'free-fall' bankruptcy as settlement talks stall,"By Mike Spector and Jessica DiNapoli
(Reuters) - OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma LP is preparing to seek bankruptcy protection before the end of the month if it does not reach a settlement with U.S. communities over widespread opioid litigation, three people familiar with the matter said, after some states balked at the company's $10 billion to $12 billion offer in August to end their lawsuits as part of a negotiated Chapter 11 case.  
On Friday, Purdue lawyers had documents prepared for a Chapter 11 filing at a moment’s notice, Reuters has learned. A federal judge, who expects plaintiffs to update him on settlement progress this week, wants 35 state attorneys general on board with a deal, a threshold that has not yet been reached, the people familiar with the matter said. 
Purdue lawyers have told lead attorneys for local governments and some state attorneys general for weeks, and again in recent days, that the company will have to file for bankruptcy without a settlement if one is not reached soon, one of the people said. This approach is known as a ""free-fall"" bankruptcy filing because it lacks consensus on a reorganization beforehand.
Strong opposition from some attorneys general such as those in Massachusetts and New York emerged last week after confidential discussions on Purdue’s settlement talks became public in media reports, with Connecticut’s calling for Purdue to be “broken up and shut down,” and sold in parts. Their main sticking point is how much Purdue's controlling Sackler family will pay, the people said. 
Purdue faces more than 2,000 lawsuits from cities, counties and states alleging it helped fuel the U.S. opioid epidemic, and Reuters reported in March that the company and family began exploring bankruptcy options for Purdue to halt lawsuits and attempt to resolve litigation with plaintiffs rather than fight every single case. 
Purdue and the Sacklers, who also face lawsuits, have denied the allegations.
One reason the Stamford, Connecticut company is determined to file for bankruptcy this month is an October 21 trial Purdue wants to avoid, the people said. The trial, stemming from widespread lawsuits largely brought by local governments that are consolidated in an Ohio federal court, risks a verdict with outsize damages that Purdue, currently carrying $500 million in cash, cannot withstand, one of the people said. 
The bankruptcy timing could slip if Purdue reaches a settlement or the October trial is delayed, the people said. Ohio’s attorney general last week asked a federal appeals court to halt the trial. 
Sackler representatives had no immediate comment regarding Purdue's bankruptcy planning or the details of settlement talks. 
In a statement, Purdue said it ""has made clear that it prefers a constructive global resolution"" as opposed to ""years of wasteful litigation and appeals."" Purdue is ""actively working with state attorneys general and other plaintiffs on solutions that have the potential to save tens of thousands of lives and deliver billions of dollars to the communities affected by the opioid crisis,"" the company said.
A representative for a plaintiffs' executive committee in the opioid litigation did not respond to a request for comment. 
NEGOTIATED BANKRUPTCY VS. ""FREE-FALL"" 
With a stable balance sheet and no significant debt, Purdue Pharma’s woes are legal, rather than financial. Purdue believes that it could put itself on firmer footing, and potentially restructure and resolve lawsuits in less time, if it were able to file for bankruptcy with a settlement in hand, the people said. 
In recent negotiations to resolve the litigation, documents exchanged among the parties outlining possible settlement terms included Purdue's plan to file for bankruptcy and become a public benefit corporation with a board selected by court-appointed trustees, the people said. The public trust would donate millions of doses of drugs the company developed to combat overdoses and addiction to U.S. communities, which Purdue values at $4.45 billion over 10 years. 
The Sacklers, who amassed a multibillion-dollar fortune from OxyContin sales, would cede control of Purdue, they said.
    On the other hand, a Chapter 11 filing without a deal could bring prolonged, more expensive bankruptcy proceedings and trigger even more litigation, the people said. Some states have said they will resist Purdue’s attempt to use bankruptcy proceedings to halt litigation. 
The company is preparing for states to argue their lawsuits cannot be halted by a Chapter 11 filing because their legal actions were brought to enforce public health and safety laws—exempting them from the usual bankruptcy rules that would stop their complaints.
A free-fall bankruptcy could result in recoveries closer to $1 billion for U.S. communities suing the company as opposed to the up to $12 billion in value Purdue attaches to its current proposal, according to calculations the company's lawyers have shared with plaintiffs.
Several state attorneys general contend the Sacklers' proposed settlement contribution is too low, the people said. The family offered to pay $3 billion over seven years and to add $1.5 billion or more by eventually selling another business the family owns called Mundipharma, they said. 
    But these state officials do not want the additional $1.5 billion to be contingent on the Mundipharma sale, and prefer the Sacklers guarantee $4.5 billion, the people said. Another contentious point is the family's proposal to pay small amounts of the $3 billion of cash initially and more later, other people familiar with the negotiations said.
    Some state officials also want to know more about the family's finances before agreeing to a deal, concerned more money could be available for a settlement, these other people said. 

    The Sacklers as of last week had not moved from their offer, according to the three people familiar with the talks.

776,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 03, 2019 09:26PM ET</span>",Google target of new U.S. antitrust probe by state attorneys general,"(Reuters) - More than 30 U.S. state attorneys general are readying an investigation into Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google for potential antitrust violations, a source knowledgeable about the probe said on Tuesday.
Texas leads the group of 30-plus attorneys general, which plans to announce the probe on Sept. 9, the source said.
Google said that it was cooperating with the state officials.
""We continue to work constructively with regulators, including attorneys general, in answering questions about our business and the dynamic technology sector,"" Google representative Jose Castaneda said.
The probe is focused on the intersection of privacy and antitrust, according to the source, who did not elaborate.
Ken Paxton, the Texas attorney general, filed comments along with 42 other state officials in June that urged the Federal Trade Commission to focus on privacy and data collection in investigating potential violations of antitrust law.
In the comment, the state officials argued that the big tech firms have so much user data that it is hard for newcomers to compete.
Another Texas official, Assistant Attorney General Jeff Mateer, alleged in an FTC hearing in June that Google and other big tech companies were misleading in representing themselves as neutral, citing Google's balking at carrying an ad about ""what it means to be an American, the Texas attorney general's office said in a statement in June. Google eventually relented on the ad, the statement said. 
The tech giants, among the richest and most powerful companies in the world, are facing increasing antitrust scrutiny from Congress, federal agencies and now state attorneys general.
The Justice Department said in July that it was opening a broad investigation of major digital technology firms, focusing on whether they engage in anticompetitive practices. The investigation is believed to be aimed at Google, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB), and potentially Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL).
Separately, the Federal Trade Commission, which also enforces antitrust law, is also probing Amazon and Facebook to determine if they abused their massive market power in retail and social media, respectively.

The Washington Post was the first to report the development on Tuesday.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) said on Tuesday that a Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Model S was in Autopilot mode and the driver's hands were off the wheel when it struck a fire truck in Culver City, California, one of a series of crashes the board is investigating involving Tesla's driver assistance system.
The 2014 Model S Autopilot system was engaged continuously for the final 13 minutes 48 seconds of the trip before the vehicle struck a fire truck parked on Interstate-405 in January 2018, the NTSB safety board said in documents posted on Tuesday.
The board plans to issue a report detailing the crash's probable cause on Wednesday.
The driver kept his hands off the wheel for all but 51 seconds of the final drive segment and received numerous alerts to place his hands back on the wheel, the documents showed. Tesla Inc did not immediately comment.
The fire truck was unoccupied and the driver was not injured in the incident.
""I was having a coffee and a bagel. And all I remember, that truck, and then I just saw the boom in my face and that was it,"" the man behind the wheel told the NTSB.
The report says the Tesla was following a vehicle for an extended period at a speed of around 21 miles per hour (33.8 kph) when the vehicle ahead changed lanes seconds before the crash
After the vehicle in front shifted, the Tesla began accelerating toward the driver-set cruise control speed of 80 mph (129 kph) and hit the parked fire truck while going 30.9 mph. The system did not detect the driver's hands on the wheel for the final 3 minutes and 41 seconds of the crash.
He did not remember precisely what he was doing at the time of the crash but could have been changing the radio or drinking coffee. Records show the driver was not using his cellphone to text or talk at the time of the crash, the NTSB said.
Tesla's Autopilot was engaged during at least three fatal U.S. crashes, including fatal March 2018 crashes of a 2018 Model 3 in Delray Beach, Florida and in Mountain View, California of a Model X. Both of those crashes remain under investigation by the NTSB and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. The agencies are also investigating other crashes and battery fires involving Tesla vehicles.
The crashes raised questions about the driver-assistance system’s ability to detect hazards and has sparked concern about the safety of systems that can perform driving tasks for extended stretches of time with little or no human intervention, but which cannot completely replace human drivers.
While Tesla drivers say they are able to avoid holding the steering wheel for extended periods while using Autopilot, Tesla advises drivers to keep their hands on the wheel and pay attention while using the system.
In May 2016, a Tesla Model S driver was killed near Williston, Florida, while Autopilot was engaged, when he slammed into a tractor trailer.

The NTSB said in 2017 that Tesla lacked proper safeguards allowing the Florida driver ""to use the system outside of the environment for which it was designed and the system gave far too much leeway to the driver to divert his attention.""

778,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 03, 2019 07:44PM ET</span>","Walmart to stop selling ammunition for handguns, assault-style weapons","By Nivedita Balu
(Reuters) - Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc, the nation's largest retailer, said on Tuesday it would stop selling ammunition for handguns and some assault-style rifles in all its stores across the United States, calling for national action on gun safety after a string of mass shootings, including two at Walmart stores in Texas and Mississippi.
Walmart is among U.S. companies, such as Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), that increasingly are responding to the debate over guns and gun safety as mass shootings have proliferated, risking backlash from powerful national gun owners' groups while elected leaders consider options.
""It’s clear to us that the status quo is unacceptable,"" Walmart's chief executive officer, Doug McMillon, said in a letter to employees. ""As a company, we experienced two horrific events in one week, and we will never be the same.""
McMillon said the decision follows his visit to El Paso, Texas, on Aug. 6, three days after a gunman went on a rampage at a Walmart store there, killing 22 people.
Walmart is also urging that background checks be strengthened and that the reauthorization of a national assault weapons ban ""should be debated to determine its effectiveness,"" McMillon said in the letter, in which he described himself as a gun owner and said that company founder Sam Walton was ""an avid outdoorsman who had a passion for quail hunting.""
Walmart will stop selling handgun sales in Alaska, the only state where it still sells hand guns, and asked customers not to openly carry firearms in its stores, even in states that allow ""open carry"" of guns. The halt on the ammunition and handgun sales will come into effect when current inventory is sold out.
PRAISE AND CRITICISM
Everytown for Gun Safety, a gun control advocacy group, applauded the actions, saying, ""Walmart has its finger on the pulse of what Americans want.""
The National Rifle Association (NRA), a pro-gun group with deep political ties, said Walmart was succumbing to pressure from ""anti-gun elites.""
""Lines at Walmart will soon be replaced by lines at other retailers who are more supportive of America's fundamental freedoms,"" it said.
The company said its latest actions would reduce its share of the ammunition market from around 20% to a range of about 6% to 9%, and would trend toward the lower end of that range over time.
U.S. gun and ammunition stores had total sales of about $11 billion last year, of which 19% was ammunition, according to market research firm IBISWorld.
The move reflects growing corporate activism on guns.
Walmart, like rival Dick's Sporting Goods, had already ended sales of assault rifles and raised the minimum age for gun purchases to 21.
Bank of America last year said it would no longer lend to companies making military-style firearms for civilians, and airlines Delta and United last year said they were no longer offering discounted rates to the NRA.
The latest move will leave Walmart focused on weapons for hunting, including deer rifles, shotguns and related ammunition.
""The general principle is if we don't sell the firearm we wouldn't sell the ammunition,"" a spokesman for Walmart told Reuters.
Walmart will stop selling all handgun ammunition and some short-barrel rifle ammunition such as the .223 caliber and 5.56 caliber after clearing current stock. Walmart did not comment on sales of other caliber ammunition.
While short-barrel ammunition is commonly used in some hunting rifles for small animals such as prairie dogs, it can also be used in military-style weapons with high-capacity magazines. 
Just last month, Walmart said it would not change its policy on selling firearms even as it took down signs and playable demos of violent video games.

On Friday, McMillon in his letter to employees said he would send letters urging action on ""common sense measures"" to the White House and the Congressional leadership.

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazilian automaker CAOA reached an initial agreement to buy Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co's plant in Sao Bernardo do Campo, the companies said on Tuesday, but CAOA could slash 1,300 jobs, according to the union representing the plant's workers. 
Ford announced in February that it would shut down the plant, its oldest in Brazil, which employs some 3,000 workers, as part of a global restructuring and a push to exit the heavy truck business. 
CAOA and Ford have been negotiating the purchase since late February, Reuters reported at the time, when Sao Paulo state Governor Joao Doria rushed to find a buyer for the plant in a push to keep jobs in the city. 
Wagner Santana, president of the union that represents Ford's workers, told reporters that in conversations with CAOA, the Brazilian automaker said it would initially retain only some 800 workers and that 1,300 would be let go, with the remainder being kept by Ford. 
Doria has defended Sao Paulo as a manufacturing hub at a time when the auto industry turned to other Brazilian states that were offering aggressive tax incentives. He has introduced a tax incentive of his own. 
At the news conference, Doria said a decision on how many jobs will be kept can only be made once Ford and CAOA close the sale, which is set to go through a 45-day due diligence process. 
""Preserve all jobs, that's the fundamental condition for a contribution from the state,"" Doria said, in reference to potential tax benefits. 
Santana said CAOA plans to pay those it hires up to 80% of their current Ford salaries, noting that is still much more than salaries paid in other states. 
A CAOA spokesperson declined to comment. 
""The objective is to make the factory profitable and productive, so it generates employment and riches,"" said Carlos Alberto Oliveira Andrade, CAOA's president and founder, whose initials make up the company name. 
Brazil's large domestic market and protectionist economy has long attracted the world's biggest automakers to set up shop here, and CAOA is the rare carmaker that is actually domestically owned. It has struck deals to make cars for Korea's Hyundai and co-owns China's Chery operation in Brazil, whose cars are branded as CAOA Chery.

Ford opened the plant in 1967, and it is the company's oldest in the country. It was primarily used to make heavy trucks, as well as the compact Ford Fiesta, a sales laggard. Ford is undergoing a global restructuring and has said it would focus on a much newer plant in the Northeastern state of Bahia.

783,By Investing.com,"<span>Sep 03, 2019 05:23PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch,"Investing.com – Here’s a preview of the top three things that could rock markets tomorrow. 
1. U.S. Trade Data, Beige Book in Focus
With no end in sight to the U.S.-China trade war, the U.S. trade data for August may take on added importance. 
The Commerce Department will release the latest trade balance figures at 8:30 AM ET (12:30 GMT). On average, economists expect that the U.S. trade deficit narrowed to $53.50 billion in August, according to forecasts compiled by Investing.com.
Attention will then likely shift to monetary policy, with the release of the Federal Reserve’s beige book at 2:00 PM ET.
With just two weeks to go until the Fed is widely expected to cut interest rates by a quarter point, investors are likely to look at the Fed’s beige book for a readthrough on the underlying strength of the economy and clues about monetary policy measures. 
In addition, Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari, New York Fed President John Williams and Chicago Fed President Charles Evans speak at events Wednesday that could shed light on the Fed’s direction for rates.
2. Loonie Watch: BoC Rate Decision
With the Bank of Canada on Wednesday expected to leave its benchmark rate unchanged at 1.75%, the accompanying monetary policy statment due at 10 AM ET (14:00 GMT) will come under scrutiny. 
A tweak to the final paragraph in the statement “the degree of accommodation being provided by the current policy interest rate remains appropriate” to language that suggests the policy rate has become somewhat restrictive would likely indicate the central bank has turned more dovish, Scotiabank said in a note to clients. 
But the BoC may be forced to cut rates in the not too distant future as slowing global growth will likely slow the Canadian economy, RBC said. 
“We continue to expect the Canadian central bank will follow other global peers with a rate cut,” RBC said. 
“Probably not at next week’s policy decision but with the risks tilted to an earlier cut than the Q1-2020 move we have in our current base case,” it added.
USD/CAD ended the day roughly unchanged, trading at around C$1.3330.
American Eagle Outfitters Earnings Due
Earnings are thin on the ground this week, but there will be a quarterly report from   American Eagle Outfitters   (NYSE:AEO) before the opening bell. 
With about 30% of its goods imported from China, American Eagle is expected to report a decline in earnings as the ongoing U.S.-China trade war and global recession fears will likely weigh on growth. 
But there is some hope that top line growth will be boosted by the retailer’s American Eagle and Aerie brands. 
The apparel retailer is expected to report earnings of 32 cents a share, down from 34 cents a year earlier, on revenue of $1.01 billion, up from $964.85 million a year earlier. 
Shares are off 15.8% this year."

The S&P 500 fell 0.69% on Tuesday. The Dow Jones industrials  dropped 1.08%. And the Nasdaq Composite was off 1.1%.
U.S. financial markets were closed Monday for Labor Day.
There were plenty of reasons for the slump.
There was the imposition of new 15% tariffs on goods imported from China and a similar tariff imposed by China on U.S.-made imports. The two sides have mostly toned down the rhetoric, but talks expected this month have not yet been scheduled.
A weak report on U.S. manufacturing activity from the ISM dowing contraction in the sector for the first time in three years.
Concerns continued about political chaos in the United Kingdom that could affect the British and European economies. After the close of trading, Prime Minister Boris Johnson lost a vote that allows tomorrow for debate for a no-deal Brexit.
Antitrust worries increased for Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL). Some 30 states are planning to join an antitrust probe of the Internet giant, the Washington Post reported Tuesday. Google shares were off about 1.7%.
And there were new worries about when Boeing will be able to get the 737 Max airliner back in the air. Boeing (NYSE:BA) was off 2.66%, the weakest Dow performer, and contributed 66 points to the Dow's 286-point loss.
Many investors coped with the volatility by seeking safe havens, especially gold and Treasury securities. Gold futures jumped $26.50 to $1,555.90 an ounce in futures trading in New York and there was talk the metal could move higher.
Some stocks held their own because of predictable cash flows and little exposure to geopolitical issues, including American Tower (NYSE:AMT) and Everest Re Group (NYSE:RE).
Among the eight Dow stocks that showed gains were Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG), Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) and Walmart (NYSE:WMT), all classic defensive stocks.
The 10-Year Treasury yield fell to 1.472% after hitting a two-and-a-half-year low of 1.429%. 
Oil futures moved lower, with West Texas Intermediate crude  falling $1.16 to $53.94 a barrel in futures trading. Brent crude, the global benchmark, was off 40 cents to $58.26 a barrel. 
With Tuesday's losses, the S&P 500 is 4% from its peak in July. The Dow is off 4.67% and the Nasdaq is off 5.58%. All three indexes remain firmly in the black on the year, however. 
But the averages are still below their Autumn 2018 peaks, suggesting that there are powerful resistance forces that could limit the market's gains. Fueling the resistance is the uncertainty caused by the U.S.-China trade fight as well as uncertainty in Europe over Brexit and also economic uncertainty in Latin America. 
Wednesday may see some pressure from food processor   Tyson Foods   (NYSE:TSN), which cut full-year guidance in part because of commodity-price volatility and costs associated with enhancing food safety. Shares fell 6.2% after hours.
In addition, traders will be watching to see where Hurricane Dorian is heading and for signals on where the August jobs report will land. The report is due before Friday's open.
Kidney-dialysis-center operator DaVita HealthCare Partners (NYSE:DVA), American Tower (NYSE:AMT), reinsurance company Everest Re Group (NYSE:RE) and Nextera Energy (NYSE:NEE) were among the top S&P 500 performers Tuesday. 
Alexion Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:ALXN), IPG Photonics (NASDAQ:IPGP), oil-and-gas producer Concho Resources (NYSE:CXO) and Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies (NYSE:WAB) were among the S&P 500's biggest laggards."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks fell on Tuesday as investors worried about global growth prospects after data showed U.S. factory activity shrank in August for the first time since 2016 and the United States and China imposed new tariffs on each other over the weekend.
Investors fled riskier assets as the latest round of tariffs and the lack of a date for a resumption of U.S.-China talks gnawed at any hopes for a resolution to the long-running trade war, which has rattled markets for months and weighed on world economies.
Compounding the uncertainty, the Institute for Supply Management said early in the day that its index of national factory activity dropped to 49.1, compared with a reading of 51.1 estimated by analysts polled by Reuters. 
""If anything the U.S. manufacturing data signals that the new tariffs couldn't come at a worse time. It's bad news on top of bad news. That's why investors are so focused on negotiations"" said Alec Young, managing director of global markets research at FTSE Russell based in New York. 
""Not only have expectations been receding for a U.S.-China deal but they can't even agree on a date to meet,"" said Young.

788,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 03, 2019 04:05PM ET</span>",Stocks Decline on Trade Woes; Treasuries Rise,"(Bloomberg) - Stocks fell as trade talks between the U.S. and China struck another stumbling block, while Treasuries rose and the dollar declined after an American gauge of manufacturing signaled contraction for the first time in three years.
The S&P 500 dropped for the first time in four sessions as Chinese and American officials struggled to agree on a schedule for negotiations after Washington rejected Beijing’s request to delay tariffs that took effect over the weekend, according to a Bloomberg report. Technology shares weighed on benchmarks after Huawei Technologies accused the U.S. government of harassing workers and attacking its internal network. Boeing (NYSE:BA) led losses on the Down Jones Industrial Average.
The 10-year Treasury yield and the dollar dropped after the Institute for Supply Management’s purchasing managers index fell to 49.1 in August, which when below 50 indicates manufacturing contracted for the month. The reading joined a slew of weak numbers produced by factory gauges across the globe, adding to concerns about the world economy and boosting bets on deep rate cuts by the Federal Reserve this year.
“People felt better last week because there was better verbal communication, comments going on out of the United States and abroad. But actions speak louder than words and neither side backed off lifting their tariffs on this prescribed date,” Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at the Leuthold Group, said in an interview. “There’s a difference between where we were Friday and where we are now in terms of the tariffs actually going into effect. That and a weak manufacturing number out of China and now a weak manufacturing number in the United States just reinforces that trade is having a negative impact.”
September has begun with a rocky start for risk assets as traders remain sensitive to the twists and turns of the Sino-U.S. trade war, and the first big economic data of the month reminded investors the global economy remains on shaky ground partly as a result. With mistrust on both sides, officials from the world’s two largest economies are struggling to agree on basic terms of re-engagement and even when to hold meetings planned for this month.

President Nicolas Maduro's government has defaulted on most of roughly $60 billion in foreign bonds issued by Venezuela and state oil company Petroleos de Venezuela, S.A., known as PDVSA, but has had minimal contact with creditors about addressing the situation. 
Guaido, the leader of the opposition-run Congress who has been recognized by more than 50 countries as Venezuela's rightful leader, is preparing for a negotiating process after Maduro leaves power. The legislature last month said it would form a commission to eventually renegotiate the debt.
Venezuela is mired in a hyperinflationary economic crisis that has led to shortages of food and medicine and prompted more than 4 million people to emigrate. Making debt payments in those circumstances would likely draw criticism from some sectors of the opposition who believe helping the vulnerable should be a priority. 
The law firm offered ""an accommodation on legal cost for an initial period"" due to the humanitarian crisis in Venezuela, Guaido's office said in a statement posted on Twitter. 
Sergio Galvis, Sullivan & Cromwell's head of Latin American and Sovereign Finance practices, and Jim Bromley, the co-head of the firm's Restructuring Group, will lead the negotiating team, according to the statement. 
Sullivan & Cromwell did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Toronto-based Onex's planned C$3.5 billion ($2.6 billion) buyout of Calgary-based WestJet has received approval from the carrier's shareholders and some regulators, but the agency is still reviewing whether the deal meets Canada's protective ownership laws.
Under Canadian rules, foreigners cannot own more than 49% equity in a Canadian airline. The rules further restrict a foreign airline and any single foreign owner from controlling more than a quarter of voting interests in a Canadian carrier.
The likely presence of Onex co-investors such as foreign wealth funds and carriers, and the ""opaque nature"" of the deal to buy WestJet through company subsidiary Kestrel Bidco, will make it harder to ensure compliance with ownership laws, Air Canada argued in the letter to the Canadian Transportation Agency, dated Aug. 15.
""The uncertainty and flexibility of co-investor
participation introduces significant risk that non-Canadian co-investors will have control-in-fact of WestJet following the transaction,"" Air Canada said.
Air Canada declined to comment on the letter, a copy of which was seen by Reuters.
The Canadian Transportation Agency said it is aware of the issues raised in Air Canada’s letter.
""The process underway will allow the CTA to determine whether the proposed transaction will result in an undertaking that is Canadian,"" the agency said by email.
Onex said in a statement that it ""is engaged with the CTA on the regulatory approval process of our transaction.""
Air Canada also argued that Onex requires at least a quarter of its board to be Canadian, which is below the government's threshold for control.
Under the terms of the deal announced in May, Onex's acquisition of WestJet is set to close later in 2019 or early next year. WestJet shares were down 0.3% at C$30.77 on Tuesday afternoon.

(NYSE:CVX) appears to be laying the groundwork to leave Venezuela in the event that the U.S. declines to extend a waiver allowing it to continue operating in the country.
Over the past year, the San Ramon, California-based company updated some of its contracts with partners in the South American country to allow for the possibility of early termination, according to people with knowledge of the matter. Under the new terms, Chevron would incur no penalties for early termination and all payments due would be prorated up to the date of notification.
The new provisions come as the U.S. continues tightening sanctions against Venezuela in a bid to oust President Nicolas Maduro. Chevron, the last American company producing oil in the country, faces the October 25 expiration of a special waiver allowing it do business there. Some of Chevron’s long-term contracts were updated at the end of 2018, while other agreements were modified after the company obtained the sanctions waiver in July.
Chevron spokesman Ray Fohr said the company is hopeful that its license to operate will be renewed in October. “We are a positive presence in the country,” he said by email. “Our focus is maintaining the safety of the operations and supporting the more than 8,000 people who work with us as well as their families.”
If the U.S. government declines to extend Chevron’s waiver, the decision would put an end to the oil major’s 100-year history in the country, a story that started in the 1920s and survived a number of military coups and civil unrest. While  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM)., Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) Plc and ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) pulled out of Venezuela, Chevron reaffirmed its commitment to the country.
The company has applied its expertise in extracting heavy oil from California oil fields to its projects in South America and over the years has expanded its footprint by building a facility to pre-process sludgy Venezuelan oil into refinery-ready grades.
Chevron warned in August that developments in the crisis-torn South American nation could hurt its earnings.
“Future events related to the company’s activities in Venezuela may result in significant impacts on the company’s results of operation in future periods,” Chevron said in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The language had evolved from the company’s previous quarterly filing, when it said developments in the country could lead to “increased business disruption and volatility in the associated financial results.”
Chevron has about 330 direct employees in Venezuela, according to a person familiar with the company affairs. Venezuela accounted for only 1% of the company’s global crude oil output in 2018, or 42,000 barrels daily. The Petroboscan and Petropiar ventures are currently active, while the Petroindependencia and Petroindependiente projects are shut amid lack of parts and a humanitarian crisis in Venezuela."

Illinois joins 15 other states and the District of Columbia in seeking to stop the $26 billion merger, which the states argue will lead to higher costs for consumers.
A spokeswoman for T-Mobile said the company had no comment.
""With Illinois’ addition to our lawsuit, more than half the U.S. population is now represented by states that are suing to block the anti-competitive megamerger of T-Mobile and Sprint,"" said New York Attorney General Letitia James. 
Last month, a U.S. District Court in Manhattan ordered that the trial be delayed to Dec. 9, a victory for the states which had said they needed more time to investigate the deal.
""With fewer companies competing, customers would face fewer choices, higher prices, less innovation and lower quality service,"" Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul said in a statement.
The Justice Department has signed off on the merger while the Federal Communications Commission has indicated it plans to approve it, and has begun the process of formally doing so.

To win those approvals, the third- and fourth-largest U.S. wireless companies agreed to divest Sprint’s prepaid businesses to satellite television company Dish Network Corp (O:DISH) to create a fourth U.S. wireless carrier.

RBC raised its price target on Amazon to $2,600 a share from $2,250 a share, indicating potential gain of 46% from Friday's closing price of $1,776.29. Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) shares were up 0.9% to nearly $1,792.
""We believe AMZN may well generate accelerating revenue (and) unit growth for some time as One-Day goes nationwide (and) worldwide,"" RBC analyst Mark Mahaney said in a note to investors Sunday.
Amazon's rollout of its one-day shipping program is expected to not only drive subscriptions of Amazon Prime, but boost spending per household using Prime, boosting Amazon’s total revenue by 7% to 15%, RBC said. 
""Our 7-year survey on Online Retail indicates that a very high and rising 64% of U.S. internet users are 'Extremely' or 'very interested' in next-day shipping,"" Mahaney wrote. ""(Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN)) is tapping into real demand here. Makes One-Day a true (growth curve initiative).""
Amazon is expected to complete its rollout of One-day Prime across the U.S. which the e-commerce giant began rolling out June, within one year, and globally within two to three years, according to RBC. 
Amazon has seen early signs of success with its one-day shipping program as North American retail revenue gained momentum in the second quarter. 
Investment to ramp up the rollout of the delivery service may cause short-term pain as margins get compressed. But longer term, Prime may become more widely adopted. 
""One-Day will make Prime more appealing for consumers, which will make (Fulfilled By Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN)) more appealing for vendors, which will increase supply on Prime, which will make Prime more appealing for consumers,"" Mahaney said."

VIENNA (Reuters) - Austrian sensor specialist AMS (S:AMS) made a 4.3 billion euro($4.8 billion) counter-offer for larger German lighting group Osram (DE:OSRn) on Tuesday, raising the prospect of a bidding war with private equity duo Bain Capital and Carlyle (O:CG). 
AMS made its 38.50 euro ($42.90) per share offer for Osram, which is 10% above the price offered by the buyout firms, after approval from German finance watchdog Bafin, adding that the acceptance period will run from Sept. 3 until Oct. 1.
The bid automatically extends the period for the offer by Bain Capital and  Carlyle Group . The duo were already considering raising their bid, sources told Reuters on Aug. 20.
A spokesman for Bain and Carlyle declined to comment on Tuesday following the bid by AMS. 
AMS, which makes a large part of its revenues from sensors for the face recognition technology in the latest iPhones but wants to reduce its dependence on Apple (O:AAPL), is interested in Osram's technologies for self-driving cars and wants to create a global power in sensors and photonics. 
Osram shareholders who have already decided to tender for the private equity groups' offer of 35 euros per share can withdraw and retender, AMS said. 
Both bidders have provided for a minimum acceptance threshold of 70%. 
""Our offer and the combination of Osram and AMS represents a better option to all stakeholders than the private equity proposal,"" AMS Chief Executive Alexander Everke said. 
The AMS bid includes a 4.2 billion euro bridging loan facility underwritten by UBS (S:UBSG) and HSBC (L:HSBA), which AMS plans to refinance by issuing debt and equity.
SHARES RISE 
Osram shares gained as much as 2.3% but did not rise above 37.20 euros. Shares in Swiss-listed AMS rose 1.9%, still 10 Swiss francs below the closing price before it detailed its takeover plans last month.
The transaction, if successful, would be the largest purchase in AMS’s history. In the 1990s, the group had miscalculated with two acquisitions in Germany and South Africa and had to sell the businesses later at a loss.
Osram, whose lightbulbs were once ubiquitous in European homes, got into difficulties with a strategy to reinvent itself as a high-tech photonics company that included several acquisitions and a billion-euro investment in Asia. 
Under Everke, who took the helm three years ago, AMS has focused on buying new technologies. Its largest acquisition so far was the purchase of Singapore-based sensor maker Heptagon in 2016 for $855 million. 
Analysts said the combination of AMS's and Osram's lidar systems - sensors that use laser light pulses to render precise images of the environment around a car - would make sense. 

However, it might take several years until these systems bring solid revenue flows, IHS Markit analyst Dexin Chen said. Investors also questioned how the Austrian company, which has 8,500 employees, will be able to integrate the German group, which last year had more than 24,200 staff working in more than 120 countries and at 27 production facilities worldwide.

808,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 03, 2019 12:16PM ET</span>",European fashion brands agree new deal in Bangladesh,"By Serajul Quadir
DHAKA (Reuters) - European fashion brands who buy readymade garments from Bangladesh agreed on Tuesday to hand over responsibility for issues like worker safety to a new body called the Readymade Sustainability Council (RSC).
RSC, governed by the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BGMEA), and brands and workers' representatives, will replace the Accord on Fire and Building Safety in Bangladesh to ensure compliance with work-place monitoring in the industry.
The Accord was set up by European brands to improve factory safety in Bangladesh after a garment factory complex collapsed in 2013, killing more than 1,100 people.
The five-year pact was originally due to expire in May 2018 but a longer transition period was agreed. Attempts by the Accord's members to extend its authority to operate were challenged in court by factory owners and the government set up its own body to take over its work.
""We could reach an agreement after two days of detailed discussions among us where almost all the representatives of fashion brand attended,"" said Rubana Huq, President of BGMEA.
""We have came together in good faith for a smooth transition from ACCORD to RSC and from now our formal journey has started,"" she said.
The RSC is an unprecedented national initiative, uniting industry, brands and trade unions to ensure a sustainable solution to carry forward the significant accomplishments made on workplace safety in Bangladesh, Huq said.
""The RSC will also encompass industrial relations, skill development and environmental standards,"" she added.
Low wages have helped Bangladesh build the world’s second-largest garment industry, behind China, with some 4,000 factories employing about 4 million workers.
Readymade garments are a mainstay of the economy, contributing almost 16% of Gross Domestic Product and about $34 billion worth of exports in the last fiscal year ending in June 2019.
Bangladesh is among the world's largest exporters of apparel sold by Western companies like H&M, Adidas (DE:ADSGN) and Walmart (NYSE:WMT), but the industry has been plagued by fires and explosions which have killed hundreds in recent years.
The Accord, signed by brands including H&M and Benetton, has been credited with improving factory safety in Bangladesh through inspections and funding."

810,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 03, 2019 11:37AM ET</span>",Netflix applies for license under new Turkish broadcasting rules,"By Ali Kucukgocmen and Kenneth Li
ISTANBUL/NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. online streaming service Netflix (O:NFLX) has applied for a license to continue operating in Turkey under new online broadcasting rules that have raised fears over possible censorship in the future. 
Turkey last month granted its radio and television watchdog sweeping oversight over all online content, including streaming platforms and news outlets, a move that raised concerns that the state was tightening its control over the media.
Ebubekir Sahin, president of Turkey's television watchdog RTUK, announced Netflix's application on Tuesday, and said on Twitter that over 600 institutions, including local streaming platforms Puhu TV and Blu TV, had also applied for licenses. 
As part of obtaining the license, the Los Gatos, California-based subscription streaming service will set up a local entity and pay 0.5% of revenue generated in Turkey to the government. The company said it is in discussions to pay similar levies in Spain and Italy.
Netflix serves 1.5 million subscribers in Turkey and only reaches about 10% of the country's broadband households, the company said, making the Turkish market a potentially important and lucrative source of new subscribers as competition mounts. 
The company operates one of the world's largest streaming services and has sustained its position at the top by courting new subscribers outside the United States as its U.S. home market matures.
To date, Turkey has not attempted to censor Netflix content, a source familiar with the matter said.
Turkey's new regulation stipulates that content providers should get a fresh license to continue operating in Turkey, and comply with RTUK guidelines. 
If they don't respect the guidelines, they will be given 30 days to change their content, or face having their licenses suspended for three months and later canceled. The announcement last month did not specify what standards RTUK would expect.
Critics have said the move will allow the government to tighten its grip on Turkish media, which is largely owned or controlled by supporters of President Tayyip Erdogan and his ruling AK Party.
GROWTH MARKET
Netflix and the Saudi Arabian government were widely condemned when the company pulled an episode of the comedy show, ""Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj"" from its Saudi Arabia service in January, after officials complained. The show was critical of Saudi Arabia after the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.
Unlike other popular internet-based content providers and services, including Alphabet Inc's (O:GOOGL) YouTube and  Twitter Inc  (N:TWTR), which were banned at one time in Turkey, Netflix is generally not a platform for news or current affairs.
Netflix is hoping a proactive approach to working with local regulators, such as by bolstering parental controls, would help it address potential censorship issues down the line, the source said.
""Our goal is to protect children from content that may be inappropriate for their age, while ensuring our members can continue to watch the shows and films of their choice,"" a Netflix spokesman said on Monday. 
Netflix declined to comment about potential censorship concerns beyond its statement.
In the quarter ended June 30, it lost subscribers in the United States for the first time in eight years and fell short of targets for new subscriber growth overseas. Netflix executives said it would still meet its annual target.
In Turkey, it has invested in local programing and some of its TV series have attracted international audiences, including ""The Protector,"" about an Istanbul shopkeeper who battles immortal enemies. 
Netflix has ordered two seasons of ""The Gift"" - another Turkish supernatural drama - and has commissioned the Turkish series, ""Love 101.""

Shares of Netflix were down 1% to $290.86 on Nasdaq.

LONDON (Reuters) - Growing worries about Britain crashing out of the European Union and a general election that could usher in a new government and major changes to UK Plc have steepened the discount for London-listed companies with exposure to the domestic economy.
Shares in London-listed companies that make the bulk of their revenue in Britain have suffered since the June 2016 referendum on European Union membership.
But worries about a no-deal Brexit have grown following the appointment of staunch Brexiteer Boris Johnson as Prime Minister in July.
His implicit threat on Monday night to lawmakers to back him on Brexit or face an election reignited an old worry for investors - a potential victory for the opposition Labour Party.
Aside from a Labour government, there are two main options from an election: a Brexit-supporting government under Johnson or a hung parliament that could lead to a coalition or minority government of some kind.
No-deal Brexit worries combined with fresh upheaval over a general election have made UK assets even less palatable, said Edward Park, deputy chief investment officer at Brooks Macdonald.
""The outcomes are becoming more extreme and political backdrop is getting rockier and that's that discount is coming into markets as well,"" he said.
JP Morgan's UK domestic plays index that tracks about 30 UK stocks that make all or most of their revenue at home was down 1.4%, heading for its worst day in two weeks and lagging the blue-chip FTSE 100 index.
In contrast, the JP Morgan index that follows UK-listed companies making their money abroad was down 0.2%, outperforming the London blue chip index and the major European bourses which were all deep in the red.
The yawning gap between the domestic and exporter indices was the widest since their inception shortly after the referendum.
The domestic index's discount to the London blue-chip benchmark since the start of the year widened to 6.6% Tuesday, while the exporter heavy index has beaten by 3.8%.

813,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 03, 2019 10:36AM ET</span>",Mediaset's pan-European plan set to survive Vivendi opposition,"By Elvira Pollina
MILAN (Reuters) - Italian broadcaster Mediaset's (MI:MS) plan to reorganize its businesses as part of a pan-European growth strategy is set to be approved by shareholders on Wednesday, despite opposition from the group's second biggest investor,  Vivendi  (PA:VIV).
But the French media group could still throw a spanner in the works if it decides to sell its  Mediaset  stake - as the corporate overhaul is conditional on no more than 180 million euros being spent to mop up the shares of investors who head for the door.
At Wednesday's meeting, shareholders will be asked to approve merging Mediaset with its Spanish unit Mediaset Espana and putting both groups under a newly created Dutch holding, called MediaforEurope (MFE).
Mediaset, controlled by the family of Italy's former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi, aims to use the new entity as a platform to develop continental alliances with other broadcasters and tackle competition from video-streaming services such as Netflix (O:NFLX) and Amazon Prime Video (O:AMZN).
The French conglomerate, led by media tycoon Vincent Bollore, opposes the plan because it includes a governance structure and a loyalty share scheme that would tighten the grip of Berlusconi's family on the group.
Vivendi has been a hostile Mediaset shareholder since Bollore and Berlusconi fell out in 2016 over an aborted pay-TV deal, and the French group built a 29% stake in Mediaset - a holding that the Italian group considers illegitimate. The two sides have been in a legal war ever since.
Two-thirds of Vivendi's stake in Mediaset is held by an arms-length trust which has in the past been barred from voting by an Italian court.
That leaves Vivendi with 9.99% direct voting rights. The group was granted the right to vote at the shareholder meeting by a Milan court last week, but its voting stake is not enough to block the deal on its own.
Mediaset is controlled by the Berlusconi family holding, Fininvest, which has a 45.8 percent stake, meaning it is almost certain of seeing the plan through.
Mediaset's board will convene on Wednesday morning and is expected to keep the trust which holds the rest of Vivendi's stake out of the shareholder meeting, preventing it from voting, a source close to the matter said.
Should Vivendi decide to exercise its withdrawal rights and sell its 9.99% stake, Mediaset would have to pay it around 310 million euros - more than the 180 million euros level it set itself as the maximum ceiling for investors opposing the deal.
Vivendi has not made clear whether it is prepared to head for the door. Doing so would translate in a loss of around 320 million euros on the whole holding for the French group.
Some sources also said that Bollore, who himself has been trying to build a south-European media giant, might prefer to remain as an investor in the hope the courts rule in his favor and he can eventually increase his sway over the company.
The Mediaset shareholder meeting is due to start at 0800 GMT at the company's headquarters near Milan."
814,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 03, 2019 10:31AM ET</span>","With contract expiration looming, UAW targets GM first for talks","By Nick Carey
(Reuters) - The United Auto Workers union on Tuesday said that it would target General Motors Co (N:GM) first of the Detroit automakers for talks ahead of the current four-year contract's expiration on Sept. 14.
This year's contract talks between the union and GM,  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) and  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles NV (MI:FCHA) (N:FCAU) are expected to be contentious as U.S. new vehicle sales are slowing and automakers face rising costs associated with the development of electric vehicles and self-driving cars.
Rising healthcare costs, job security, profit sharing and the use of temporary workers are expected to be major sticking points.
GM in particular has been a target of union ire since announcing the closure of five North American plants late last year.
That move drew a wave of criticism, including from U.S. President Donald Trump. Trump has repeatedly prodded GM and last week said the No. 1 U.S. automaker should begin moving its operations in China back to the United States.
""We are prepared and we are all ready to stand up for our members, our communities and our manufacturing future,"" UAW President Gary Jones said in a statement.
In a statement, GM said, ""We look forward to having constructive discussions with the UAW on reaching an agreement that builds a strong future for our employees and our business.""
The contracts come at a difficult time for the UAW, as a federal corruption investigation into the union continues to grow.
Last week, the FBI conducted searches at Jones' home, a union retreat and multiple other locations, including the home of the union's previous president, Dennis Williams (NYSE:WMB).
To date, seven people linked to the union and the automaker have been sentenced in the government's corruption investigation."

818,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 03, 2019 09:56AM ET</span>",Executive's flight to PSA highlights Renault-Nissan tensions,"By Gilles Guillaume and Laurence Frost
PARIS (Reuters) - A senior Renault-Nissan executive has quit the troubled carmaking alliance to join  Peugeot  maker PSA Group (PA:PEUP), blaming  Renault  boss Thierry Bollore for forcing his exit.
Former alliance director Arnaud Deboeuf will become PSA's industrial strategy director under Chief Executive Carlos Tavares, himself a former Renault (PA:RENA) second-in-command, the rival French carmaker confirmed on Tuesday.
Deboeuf's departure underscores deep tensions threatening to subsume the Renault-Nissan alliance in the wake of the November 2018 arrest of former Chairman Carlos Ghosn, now awaiting trial in Japan on financial misconduct charges he denies.
Those tensions have been exacerbated by failed attempts under Bollore and new Renault Chairman Jean-Dominique Senard to secure a full Renault-Nissan merger and to combine Renault with Fiat Chrysler (FCA), a move thwarted by France.
Deboeuf was well regarded at Nissan and even offered a senior executive role at the Japanese carmaker, as his relations with Bollore soured following Ghosn's ouster, three sources told Reuters. But Bollore, a former Ghosn protégé who succeeded his absent boss as CEO in January, blocked the move.
""Thierry Bollore told me no one wanted to work with me ... and that I could not go to work at Nissan either,"" Deboeuf said in a farewell email to colleagues seen by Reuters.
Renault declined to comment on Deboeuf's departure. Deboeuf did not respond to requests for comment.
Since FCA deal talks collapsed in June, Nissan has pressed Renault to cut its 43.4% stake in the Japanese carmaker as the price of its support for a revived FCA tie-up.
Renault is refusing to consider cutting its holding below a 33% blocking minority, and no agreement is yet in sight, according to two people closely following Renault-Nissan talks on the future of the alliance.
One option being discussed is a smaller immediate stake cut and an agreed mechanism to deliver a deeper reduction in future, if key milestones are met, one of the sources told Reuters.
Shares in Nissan, hit by a sales slump since Ghosn's exit, are trading 35% below their value before his Nov. 19 arrest. The stock rose 1.3% on Tuesday, with Renault advancing 1% on reports that the alliance talks were progressing.
Deboeuf's move adds to a steady Renault brain-drain to PSA since 2013, when Tavares was hired to rescue the carmaker from near-bankruptcy. 
Other switchers from Renault include Yann Vincent, PSA's executive vice president for manufacturing, powertrain engineering chief Alain Raposo. Thierry Koskas joined PSA as sales chief in March, two months after Bollore ousted him from the same role at Renault.

Tavares, who preceded Bollore as Ghosn's No.2 at Renault, was pushed out after publicly voicing CEO ambitions. Under its Portuguese-born leader, PSA has set new profitability records while making swift headway on the integration of Opel, acquired from General Motors (N:GM) in 2017.

Despite a confluence of difficult business conditions, the outlet is expected to do well when it debuts in November, according to FWM Restaurants, which manages Red Lobster in Greater China. The restaurant will be located in Causeway Bay, one of the city’s busiest shopping districts and also a key site of the months-long protests.
“When it gets a bit turbulent or things get a bit tough, brands do well,” David Martin, chief operations officer at FWM, said in an interview Tuesday. “We are going to make sure we emphasize the value proposition.”
Hong Kong’s retailers from glitzy shops to mom-and-pops are feeling the pain of violent protests that have disrupted businesses and discouraged tourism. FWM, which has a joint venture with the U.S.-based chain to run the outlets in Greater China, is betting big on Red Lobster’s success in the city, undaunted by sliding sales at a burger chain it operates separately in the former British colony.
Butchers Club, which clocked double-digit growth year-on-year at the beginning of 2019, is set to reverse into a decline since the demonstrations started in June, Martin said. FWM operates from its bases in Hong Kong and Shanghai.
Retail Pain
The city’s seen 13 consecutive weekends of rallies, originally held to protest a proposed extradition bill and have morphed into pro-democracy calls, have added to the headwinds of a prolonged U.S.-China trade war and slowing economies in both Hong Kong and China.
From Dior to Dried Fish, Hong Kong Retailers Feel Protest Pain
Retail sales in the territory by volume fell 13% in July, the first full month affected by demonstrations, while the city’s economy contracted by 0.4% in the second quarter.
While Red Lobster is a casual dining restaurant in the U.S., it is marketing itself as a premium offering in mainland China, according to Martin.
FWM operates four Butchers Club restaurants in Hong Kong. To deal with sliding sales, it’s worked with employees to clear leave days and also pared part-time staff when needed. It’s also negotiated with suppliers to extend payment terms and some discounts for the chains it runs.
Martin, like many retailers, said he hopes the protests will be done when the convention season kicks into high gear September to November.
“If we lose that convention business, that will be very difficult,” he said. “You try to do whatever you can to drive traffic. It will be great for the consumer.”
To push sales, retailers and restaurants will need to offer significant deals and promotions to attract shoppers and diners, said Martin.
Canadian Lobsters
Currently operating two outlets in China, Red Lobster sees more on the way as China becomes a larger market for the chain than Canada and Japan. FWM is scouting Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Chengdu and Wuhan, cities where it already operates other dining chains, said Martin.
Red Lobster, which is the largest seafood-buying restaurant globally, had to make some adjustments because of the ongoing trade war for the mainland outlets. Instead of importing the crustaceans from the U.S., it’s ordering them from Canada to skirt a 35% tariff.
The chain, known for its popular Endless Shrimp all-you-can-eat dishes, has also had to turn to a local supplier to replicate its cheddar bay biscuits because of tariffs on some ingredients.
Still, FWM is bullish on China. The slowdown isn’t a pressing concern as it looks to expand in the world’s second biggest economy, he said.
“What other economy has 6% GDP growth right now and an incredibly large middle-class market that’s growing?” he said. “Our business is fueled by middle-class markets.”"

LONDON (Reuters) - A top-10 shareholder in  Just Eat  (L:JE) said on Tuesday it would vote against the British food delivery company's proposed 9 billion pound ($11 billion) merger with Takeaway.com (AS:TKWY), saying the deal undervalued Just Eat.
Eminence Capital, a U.S. asset management firm which owns 4.4% of Just Eat, said the merger had a sound strategic rationale but the financial terms of the deal were ""grossly inadequate to Just Eat shareholders.""
Last month Amsterdam-based Takeaway.com and rival Just Eat finalised the terms of a deal, first outlined in July, to create a global food delivery company to rival Uber Eats (N:UBER) as the largest outside China.
The group, to be called Just Eat Takeaway.com, would be a market leader in Britain, Germany, the Netherlands and Canada.
Investment firm Cat Rock, however, said on Tuesday Just Eat shareholders should vote for the merger unless a more ""compelling and credible"" counter-offer emerges.
""Voting against the Just Eat and Takeaway.com merger benefits no one but Just Eat's competitors,"" Cat Rock said in a statement https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5c13f4c6e17ba3aca12b9686/t/5d6e5eef4f45fb00014f46f7/1567514352007/Cat+Rock+Capital+Press+Release+on+Just+Eat+plc+9-3-19+vFinal.pdf. The activist investor owns 3% of Just Eat’s shares and a 4.3% stake in Takeaway.com, according to Refinitiv Eikon data. 
Cat Rock had been pushing Just Eat to merge with a rival such as Takeaway and has also stepped up its campaign for changes at the company.
The merger deal would see Just Eat shareholders receive 0.09744 new Takeaway.com shares for each of their shares. When it was announced on Aug. 5 it valued Just Eat at around 4.7 billion pounds ($5.8 billion).
However, as of Monday's closing prices, Just Eat's market capitalization was 5.33 billion pounds.
""It is clear to us that (Takeaway.com's) offer of a 15% premium to (Just Eat's) closing price on July 26 is highly opportunistic,"" said Ricky Sandler, chief executive and chief investment officer of Eminence.
""The proposed financial terms are far too favorable to (Takeaway.com) shareholders and far too unfavorable to (Just Eat) shareholders. Accordingly, we intend to vote against this arrangement,"" he said.
The merger deal, which is being carried out through a so-called scheme of arrangement, requires the support of 75% of Just Eat shareholders to go through.
Just Eat had no immediate comment. Its shares were 3.3% lower at 750.2 pence at 1306 GMT. 
Last month Aberdeen Standard Investments, Just Eat's sixth-biggest investor with a 5.1% stake, according to Refinitiv data, also said the deal did not value the British company highly enough and it expected an improved offer to emerge.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. companies planning to launch initial public offerings (IPOs) in the coming weeks are hoping that August's bout of stock market volatility will subside this month, according to investment bankers and capital markets lawyers advising them.
The U.S. trade war with China caused the stock market to seesaw in August. The CBOE Volatility index (VIX), Wall Street's fear gauge, rose around 17.7% last month, the second-biggest monthly jump so far in 2019. Last month was also the worst August for U.S. stocks in four years.
Market volatility can prevent IPOs from going ahead because it makes it difficult for investment bankers to price them by balancing demand and supply for the shares on offer. However, August is traditionally a slow month for IPOs due to the summer holidays. Only seven IPOs took place last month.
By contrast, almost 70 companies have registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for an IPO, according to research firm Renaissance Capital, which estimates companies could raise more than $15 billion from September until the end of 2019.
WeWork owner The We Company, food delivery platform Postmates Inc and fitness startup Peloton Interactive are among the companies expected to launch IPOs by the end of the year. Representatives for the three companies declined to comment on their IPO plans. 
""I can safely say that this has been one of busiest Augusts we have ever had in terms of IPOs getting geared up for September,"" said David Goldschmidt, global head of capital markets at U.S. law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom.
The U.S. market for IPOs typically gets back up to full speed once dealmakers and investors return to work after the Monday Labor Day holiday. 
So far in 2019, companies have raised $36.5 billion through IPOs, down slightly on the same point in 2018 but the third most active year since the 2008 financial crisis, according to financial data provider Refinitiv.
While the shares of this year's two most high-profile IPOs,  Uber Technologies Inc  (N:UBER) and  Lyft  Inc (O:LYFT), have performed poorly after their flotation, most IPOs have fared well in 2019.
Renaissance Capital's IPO-focused exchange-traded fund  is up more than 30 percent so far in 2019, around double the rise in the S&P 500 Index over the same period. Strong IPO performers have included plant-based burger maker  Beyond Meat Inc  (O:BYND) and video conferencing company  Zoom Video Communications  Inc (O:ZM).
""Conditions could all change with a tweet (such as from U.S. President Donald Trump) but, when you look at the overall market backdrop, it feels maybe not perfect but still very good for IPOs,"" said Mike O'Donovan, partner in investment bank PJT Partners Inc's (N:PJT) strategic advisory business.
UNPREDICTABLE IPO WINDOW
In the background for companies weighing the timing of their IPO, is whether or not political rhetoric from U.S. presidential candidates could make for even rougher conditions. 
The run-up to a U.S. presidential election has typically not had a major impact on prospective IPOs, though the November 2020 face-off between Republican Trump and a Democratic challenger is expected by market participants to trigger more volatility, given the polarization in U.S. politics.
""We are urging companies to be ready as soon as possible because the IPO windows have been so unpredictable,"" said Andrew Fabens, partner at Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher and co-chair of the law firm's capital markets practice.
The likes of home-sharing company Airbnb Inc, payments startup Stripe and job search platform ZipRecruiter are expected to pursue IPOs next year, and it is unclear how close their IPOs would be to the presidential election. 
Spokesman for Airbnb and ZipRecruiter declined to comment on a possible IPO. Stripe did respond to a request for comment. 
""It would be incorrect to say the IPO window closes around elections,"" said Alex Wellins, co-founder of IPO advisory and investor relations firm Blueshirt Group LLC. 
""That said,"" Wellins added, ""most people expect very high levels of volatility around this particular election.""

(This story corrects to show the CBOE Volatility index rose 17.7% last month, not around 12%)

LONDON (Reuters) - World stocks slipped and the dollar strengthened to its highest levels in more than two years on Tuesday as U.S.-China trade tensions drove investors to the relative shelter of gold, the Japanese yen and government debt.
Sterling was the big mover in currency markets, nearing a three-year low below $1.20 with British Prime Minister Boris Johnson set for a showdown with Parliament over a no-deal Brexit. 
With U.S. markets shut on Monday, global markets took their cue from weak PMI survey data in Europe and China which raised concerns the global economy was struggling on many fronts.
An index of global stocks (MIWD00000PUS) slipped 0.2% on Tuesday, heading toward a two-month low hit in early August. An index of Asian stocks (MIAPJ0000PUS) was down 0.8%.
Tensions over trade between Washington and Beijing have shown little sign of abating even though U.S. President Donald Trump has said the two sides would meet for talks this month.
""Since the trade dispute has become the driving force behind equity markets, we advise against adding significantly to equity exposure, particularly for those with an adequate strategic allocation,"" Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management, said.
European stocks were on the back foot as investors locked in profits from a three-day streak that saw indices scale near one-month highs. An index of European stocks <.MSER> was down 0.3%.

DATA HOPES
The move away from equities boosted demand for government debt with yields on benchmark U.S. Treasury bonds tumbling to toward a three-year low hit last week as investors also ramped up their bets the global economy is headed for recession. 
Market watchers are hoping that U.S. data would undermine some of those bearish bets on the global economy, with surveys from the Institute for Supply Management due later in the day and U.S. payrolls data scheduled for Friday.
""The ISM ... is going to be (a) particular important market mover as those who have been buying bonds strongly, suggesting that the U.S. is on course for recession, need to see some sort of justification,"" said Andrew Milligan, head of global strategy at Aberdeen Standard Investments.
The yield on 10-year U.S. Treasuries fell 2 basis points to 1.482% (US10YT=RR), off a three-year low of 1.443% touched last week. The yield dropped more than 50 basis points last month, the biggest monthly drop since August 2011.
Keeping in line with a general mood of risk aversion, the yen gained 0.2% against the greenback while gold  firmed toward more than a six-year high.
In the currency market, sterling slumped below $1.20 to a three-year low, as Prime Minister Johnson's implicit ultimatum to lawmakers to back him on Brexit or face an election sent investors scrambling to dump British assets. 

Oil prices were also dented by trade war concerns. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude (CLc1) lost 0.47% to $54.84 per barrel. International benchmark Brent futures (LCOc1) dipped 0.05% to $58.63 per barrel.

LONDON (Reuters) - British government borrowing costs plunged to record lows on Tuesday as the Brexit crisis prompted investors to seek the safety of gilts which outperformed both European and U.S. debt markets.
British lawmakers will try on Tuesday to stop Prime Minister Boris Johnson from pursuing a no-deal Brexit, a challenge that a senior government source said would prompt Johnson to call for a snap election on Oct. 14.
The 10-year gilt yield (GB10YT=RR) slumped to a new record low of 0.341% in early trading, according to Refinitiv data, and it recovered only some of its losses to stand at 0.367% as of 1045 GMT -- down 5 basis points on the day.
Although German Bund and U.S. Treasury yields also fell, the move was more pronounced in gilts, signaling stronger demand for British debt.
British yields have fallen sharply in recent months, reflecting not only gilts' safe-haven allure but also expectations that the Bank of England will be forced to stimulate the economy, through interest rate cuts and further purchases of gilts, in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
""Clearly the latest political developments are what's causing the more emphatic move in gilts,"" John Wraith, strategist at UBS, said.
Twenty and 30-year gilt yield (GB20YT=RR) (GB30YT=RR) also fell to record lows of 0.753% and 0.858%.
At the short end, the five-year gilt yield (GB5YT=RR) fell to its lowest since October 2016 at 0.202%, while the two-year yield (GB2YT=RR) touched its lowest since September 2017 at 0.265%.
The premium that 10-year gilts hold above comparable German Bunds narrowed on Tuesday to its lowest level since Aug. 13 at 109 basis points, down 3 bps on the day.
Gilt yields could have further to fall if Britain's political crisis were to become more precarious, but this was not a one-way bet, Wraith said.
An election could lead to looser fiscal policy by the next government, a weaker pound that would boost inflation or the election of a government with a softer approach to Brexit, all of which could reduce demand for gilts, he said.
Britain sold 3 billion pounds of the 0.625% 2025 gilt , attracting bids worth 1.84 times the amount on offer -- the weakest bid-cover ratio for a conventional gilt auction since June 25."

Investors were looking ahead to the ISM manufacturing survey, due at 10 AM ET (1400 GMT).
Last month’s index reading of 51.2 was the lowest since Trump was elected in 2016. Analysts expect it to inch down to 51.1, still just above the 50 level that separates growth from contraction.
""The ISM ... is going to be (a) particular important market mover as those who have been buying bonds strongly, suggesting that the U.S. is on course for recession, need to see some sort of justification,"" said Andrew Milligan, head of global strategy at Aberdeen Standard Investments.
IHS Markit’s PMI for U.S. manufacturing, which already last month suggested the sector was in recession is also due.
Outside of equities, the U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against six developed-market currencies, was up 0.4% to 99.22, while the yield on the 10-year Treasury was last trading at 1.48%, still below the yield on the two-year note.
The British pound was the big mover in foreign exchange markets, falling below 1.20 to its lowest level in three years after lawmakers started a move to force Prime Minister Boris Johnson to abandon his plans that could lead to a no-deal Brexit on Oct. 31.
In commodities, gold futures were up $11.75, or 0.7%, at $1,541.1 a troy ounce, while crude oil was down 89 cents, or 1.6%, to $54.19 a barrel.

The likelihood of a no-deal Brexit is on the rise, forcing finance industry executives returning from summer holidays to scrub contingency plans before Oct. 31 (although that date might still be a moving target). Big firms have spent billions of dollars in the last three years to prepare for the day, and they remain confident -- as do regulators -- in their ability to manage the fallout. Vulnerabilities remain, though, and they could prove big headaches on Halloween. Here are the issues keeping bankers awake at night.
Midweek Start
Modern finance captures immense amounts of data about financial transactions to report to regulators. Whenever there is an update to coding systems, executives in charge of that plumbing like to have ample time -- often a weekend -- to test for operational hiccups. But Brexit is now scheduled for a Thursday, leaving firms to scramble before Nov. 1 to ensure the right data goes to the right regulators in the EU and U.K. Even more complicated is that Nov. 1 is All Saints’ Day, which is a public holiday in part of the EU but not in the U.K. There is little appetite so far for the U.K. to declare a bank holiday that day.
Contract Continuity
About 16 trillion pounds ($19.3 trillion) of swaps contracts between U.K. and EU traders mature after October. While the contracts will remain valid, the Bank of England and industry lobby groups have warned so-called life cycle events in the contracts -- such as extending the maturity of a trade -- could face hurdles. EU policy makers have ruled out resolving these concerns across the bloc, leaving it to national authorities to respond. BOE Governor Mark Carney, however, says the measures in France and Germany don’t do the job to his satisfaction. Meanwhile, banks are switching contracts one by one to new EU entities from their U.K. ones -- a process known as “repapering.”
Trading Venues
EU money managers will be forced to trade certain equities on EU venues and not in the U.K. Initially, the rule even applied to some stocks with a primary listing in London, including AstraZeneca Plc,  Rio Tinto  (LON:RIO) Plc and  Vodafone  Group (LON:VOD) Plc, but EU regulators softened their stance under pressure from lobby groups. The U.K. market regulator says the EU’s policy could still cause problems because some European stocks are heavily traded in the U.K. Also unclear is how the U.K. will respond, and whether Britain will require U.K.-based money managers to trade on venues in the country.
Legislative Hiccup
The U.K. government has been working for months to make sure financial regulations are enshrined in domestic law in the event of a no-deal Brexit. But legislation is still pending to smooth that process. If Parliament is suspended, lawmakers will have only a small period to pass the Financial Services (Implementation of Legislation) Bill. If they cannot, it will be harder for the U.K. to incorporate forthcoming EU policies into domestic law. That matters if the U.K. wishes to be recognized as equivalent in the eyes of the EU regulators, which would allow firms to trade across borders more easily.
Small Firms
A large volume of business in the European payments industry is handled by platforms based in Britain. There are 363 payments institutions and 151 e-money firms operating in the U.K., many of which process electronic payments between clients in the U.K. and 27 other EU member states. These firms will lose the ability to automatically do business in the EU after Brexit, and EU authorities are telling companies to speed up contingency plans. Revolut, one of Europe’s fastest growing payments companies, set up a new European entity in preparation for a no-deal Brexit, but is warning of disruptions if clients don’t register their identity.
Property Funds
U.K. property funds were among the most visible casualties in the chaotic aftermath of the June 2016 Brexit vote. When panicked investors rushed to pull hundreds of millions from the funds, several managers suspended redemptions because they weren’t able to quickly sell buildings and raise the cash to return. To prevent a replay, fund managers have been on a mission to increase the amount of cash they hold. In December they faced another test when Brexit jitters led to investor redemptions that depleted their cash piles. Several managers have been selling properties to build up cash buffers -- as high as 28% -- to weather a no-deal departure."

SYDNEY (Reuters) - GFG Alliance has delayed a planned A$1 billion ($675 million) listing of parts of its Australian Liberty Steel unit until at least next year as a result of market volatility, two people with knowledge of the matter said.
Work had been underway to float parts of the steel business within the next two months in what would have been, according to Refnitiv, the largest listing in Australia since July 2018 when Viva Energy (AX:VEA) raised A$2.6 billion.
Investor meetings with Australian fund managers about Liberty Steel, part of a roadshow ahead of launching any float, were to have taken place during September but have now been canceled, the two people said, on condition of anonymity because the information was not yet public.
Bankers working on the deal have been told to ""put their pens down"" until next year, one of the people said.
The person added the tightness of GFG's year-end timeline and concerns about market volatility led to the delay.
The Australian benchmark index (AXJO) marked its first monthly drop this year in August, amid broader financial market turmoil stemming from persistent U.S.-China trade frictions.
Earlier on Tuesday, Australia's central bank kept its cash rate at an all-time low of 1%, but left the door ajar for further cuts, saying it was ""reasonable to expect"" lower for longer interest rates to help boost employment growth and inflation.
GFG is now not expected to test investor appetite until at least the second quarter of 2020, according to one source.
The London-based conglomerate had bought Liberty Steel from Australia's Arrium after it went into administration in 2017.
A GFG spokesman declined to comment on the IPO being shelved, but said, ""we are always open to capital market transactions as part of our broader strategy"".
GFG is owned by commodities tycoon Sanjeev Gupta. The conglomerate owns commodities trading, mining, metals, power generation and renewable energy assets worldwide.
Under the initial IPO plans for its Liberty Steel unit, GFG had planned to package together the local distribution and recycling assets of the old Arrium steel business which would be renamed Infrabuild, Reuters has reported.
GFG had previously appointed JPMorgan (N:JPM),  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS) and  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) to lead the planned IPO and Clayton Utz had been carrying out the legal work.
Deutsche closed its Australian equity capital markets business in early July as part of its global program to cut 18,000 jobs across the bank.
Representatives for JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley and Clayton Utz declined to comment."
835,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 03, 2019 05:36AM ET</span>",Marvel superheroes power up Lego's sales,"COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Models of superheroes and villains from Marvel's ""Avengers"" movies helped lift first-half sales at Lego, as the Danish toymaker continued its turnaround drive with investments in China, India, the internet and new stores. 
Lego, famous for its colorful plastic bricks, returned to sales growth last year after a decade of double-digit increases came to an abrupt halt in 2017. 
The company, which competes with the likes of Barbie maker  Mattel Inc  (O:MAT) and Hasbro (O:HAS), said on Tuesday sales rose 4% between January and June to 14.8 billion Danish crowns ($2.2 billion). In local currencies, sales grew 2%.
Niels Christiansen, who took over as chief executive in 2017, said that matched the company's ambitions for single-digit growth over the full year. 
""And I think we will deliver on that."" 
Lego said it gained share in its largest markets, with double-digit growth in China and single-digit growth in the United States and western Europe.
But operating profit declined 16% to 3.5 billion crowns due to new investments.
""It is moving rapidly toward e-commerce and toward really special retail experiences. That demands a lot from what you can do digitally, IT-wise and store-wise,"" Christiansen said. 
""In the end, it's a battle over the time kids have to play in,"" he added. 
Lego versions of Marvel's ""Avengers"" characters such as Captain America, Iron Man and Thanos were among the top sellers in the first half, while Star Wars-themed products and the company's older building sets like Lego Technic and City also contributed to growth, it said.
Despite a shift toward online sales, the company plans to add 35 shops in China by the end of the year, taking the total to more than 140 there and to nearly 600 worldwide.
""You cannot say the physical experience is not necessary, just because more is bought online,"" Christiansen said, underlining the importance of ""try-vertising"", where kids test out new products in stores. 
""It is really important in a country like China, where you have to build the brand. It's a physical product."" 
Christiansen said he hoped Lego's push into India, where it currently sells via third party stores, would mirror its success in China, though it has not decided whether to open its own shops there yet. 

""I wonder if we might have Lego-branded stores in India one day too. I think so"", he said.

836,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 03, 2019 05:20AM ET</span>",Think August Was Bad? Here Comes Worst Month for Canadian Stocks,"(Bloomberg) -- After enduring a bumpy ride in August, investors in Canadian stocks need to brace for more volatility in September, typically the worst month of the year for equities.
In the past 10 years, the S&P/TSX Composite Index has dropped an average 1.5% in September, as the end of summer, return to school and the start of a heavy conference agenda seem to be a bad combination for equities. The only other months with negative returns over the same period were October, June and January, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Don’t write off September just yet though, as the month has had its share of gains. The index has risen six of the last 10 Septembers, though massive declines in 2011, 2014 and 2015 pushed the average lower.
Investors can be forgiven for wanting to see August behind them. Global trade tensions roiled markets throughout the month, leading to wild swings amid the China-U.S. showdown. After all the noise however, the benchmark climbed 0.2% for the month, after the best weekly gain since January as energy and mining stocks rallied with commodities.
Schmoozefest
Further along the Canadian equity train ride, the next stop is ‘Hobnob Station.’
Investors will head to conferences in Toronto and New York to hear from senior executives of major Canadian companies about their growth plans and the state of their industries. There will also be plenty of time for dinners, drinks and one-on-one meetings.
In Toronto, two events stand out:
Scotiabank Financials Summit (Sept. 4-5): Presenters include C-Suite executives of the Big Six banks, life insurers like Manulife Financial Corp., Sun Life Financial Inc., and private equity firm Onex Corp.Toronto Global Forum (Sept. 4-6): Former White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci -- who has set up a political action committee in a bid to prevent Donald Trump’s re-election -- will speak along with the CEOs of various Canadian corporations and Canadian provincial and federal ministers.For Manhattan, investors are set to gather at the Sheraton Times Square (NYSE:SQ) Hotel for Barclays’ annual CEO Energy-Power conference, where majors like Suncor Energy Inc. will make presentations.
There’s one major event that will have economists and market participants on edge: Bank of Canada’s rate decision day on Sept. 4. While most expect no rate change, Governor Stephen Poloz’s comments on monetary policy will be watched closely, especially after GDP expanded 3.7% in the second quarter, beating the 3% estimate. Investors are betting on a rate cut in October, based on trading in the swaps market.
Here’s a recap of what happened last week.

Investing.com -- It’s the end of an era.
Marks and Spencer (LON:MKS), an institution of the British high street for over a century and a founder member of the FTSE 100 back in the 1980s, is about to be ejected from the U.K.’s blue-chip index.
FTSE Russell, which owns the index, said late Tuesday that the department store chain, along with software group   Micro Focus   (LON:MCRO) (whose problems we documented here last week) and insurer   Direct Line   (LON:DLGD), are all set to be demoted to the FTSE 250 at the regular quarterly review on Wednesday.
For M&S, it’s been a long time coming. For years, the trend has not been the friend of department stores, and while the company succeeded temporarily in stemming the decline by carving out a niche for itself in the high end of the grocery market, the march of the Internet and fast fashion have left it floundering. The share price, which fell 1.8% on Tuesday in reaction to the news, is down nearly 75% from its pre-crisis peak in 2007, and down by well over half from its post-crisis peak in 2015.
The problem was that analysts thought the company overpaid for a 50% stake in the joint venture that the two created. Even worse (from a short-term perspective), it did so by diluting shareholders with a 600 million-pound capital increase and a dividend cut.
To add to the gloom, analysts at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) on Monday said the JV won’t even deliver what had been hoped, at least not for five years. According to the Financial Times, Goldman sees the joint venture making just 10.6 million pounds in free cash flow by 2024. Meanwhile, the formerly core business of clothing and household goods continues to decline, eaten alive by online rivals.
If Goldman’s analysis proves well-founded, the risk of M&S having to add more to the 950 million pounds it has already written off in exceptional costs over the last two years seems to be rising.
It’s even down by nearly a quarter since February, when it moved to strengthen its food business by announcing a tie-up with Ocado (LON:OCDO), whose best-in-class logistics technology offered M&S the chance to upscale big time in food delivery.
The FTSE 100 itself was down 0.1% by 5 AM ET (0900 GMT) on Tuesday, weighed down by fears of political instability, a weak update on retail sales from the British Retail Consortium (like-for-like sales were down 0.5% in August), and by another disappointing drop in the U.K. Construction purchasing managers index.
However. It outperformed other European markets due to fresh weakness in sterling, which inflates the value of the dollar earnings of its components. The benchmark Stoxx 600 was down 0.5%, in line with the French CAC 40 and Italian FTSE MIB."

(Reuters) - European shares fell for the first time in four sessions on Tuesday, as uncertainty over Britain's chaotic exit from the European Union and trade tensions between the United States and China weighed on sentiment.
British lawmakers will decide on Tuesday whether to move the country one step closer to a snap election when they vote on the first stage of their plan to block Prime Minister Boris Johnson from pursuing a no-deal Brexit.
""There is a lot of uncertainty there, as Boris Johnson aims for new elections. The question then is if the parliament will be on time to pass a bill to make sure that a hard Brexit can't occur,"" said Teeuwe Mevissen, senior market economist at Rabobank.
The pound fell to its lowest since January 2017, helping the export-laden FTSE 100 (FTSE) outperform other European markets with a 0.07% rise.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index (STOXX) declined 0.39% by 0750 GMT.
The United States and China are struggling to schedule a meeting this month to renew trade talks after Washington rejected Beijing's request to delay tariffs that took effect over the weekend, Bloomberg reported on Monday.
""If they're struggling to decide simple itinerary, expectations for anything tangible to arise from the trade talks are looking incredibly dim at this point,"" said Stephen Innes, Asia Pacific market strategist at AxiTrader.
The rising worries encouraged investors to shift away from risky equities to safe-haven assets such as government bonds, resulting in yields on German and Italian 10-year bonds hitting a record low.
All the major European sectors were in the red, with travel and leisure stocks (SXTP) posting the steepest fall of 0.65%.
The sector was pressured by a 2.5% fall in shares of airline easyJet (L:EZJ) after Kepler Cheuvreux downgraded to 'reduce' from 'hold'.
Investor attention now shifts to the European Central Bank's meeting next week, where it is widely expected to cut interest rates to counter the impact caused by the trade war that has roiled financial markets and led to the benchmark STOXX index ending August 1.6% lower.
Ferguson (L:FERG) jumped 2.44% and was the biggest gainer on the STOXX 600, after the British plumbing products distributor said it will separate its UK operations to focus on its North American business."

Offshore, demand has weakened as escalating trade tension and a slumping yuan dampen demand for dollar notes. Concern about property developers’ ability to refinance is adding to selling pressure. Onshore, yields are falling as liquidity improves in the wake of a bank bailout.
Average yield on Chinese high-yield dollar bonds rose about 105 basis points since end-June, according to an ICE (NYSE:ICE) BofAML Index. The yield on five-year AA rated yuan corporate bonds, considered high-yield in the onshore market, fell 34 basis points during the same period, ChinaBond data show. Issuance of bonds rated AA or below rose to a four-month high of 22.1 billion yuan ($3 billion) in August, while junk bond offerings in the greenback declined to two-year low, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
Depleted quotas and new restrictions on offshore issuance will also weigh on dollar bond sales from developers for the rest of the year, according to a Moody’s Corp. note on Friday. China’s property sector makes up the majority of the Asian high-yield bond universe.
Average yields on Asian dollar-denominated junk bonds rose 77 basis points from a 14-month low in end-June, according to a Bloomberg  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Index. Charles Macgregor, head of Asia at Lucror Analytics, estimates yields on Chinese dollar junk bonds could rise by a further 100 to 150 basis points.
“Overseas investors’ concerns about the majority of Chinese-funded real estate companies have gradually increased causing them to demand a higher risk premium,” said Qi Sheng, an analyst with Zhongtai Securities Co. “These companies have encountered a tightening of overseas bond financing conditions,” according to Qi.

William Xu, president of the telecommunications equipment maker's institute of strategic research, made the comments at a company event in the southwestern Chinese city of Chengdu.
Huawei Technologies Co Ltd has been fighting a trade ban from Washington that has hurt its business since May and could cut off its access to essential U.S. suppliers. 
The Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the United States cut ties with Huawei earlier this year after U.S. authorities started investigating the firm for alleged sanctions violations while Britain's Oxford University stopped accepting funding from Huawei last year.
Xu said it was only a few institutions which had suspended their ties with the firm and that Huawei would allocate funding to institutions where the company was still welcomed. 
""This ($300 million a year) amount is only going to increase, not decrease from now on,"" he said. 

He also said the firm shipped more than 200,000 fifth-generation (5G) network telecommunication base stations to markets around the world, up from 150,000 disclosed in July.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Dai-ichi Life Insurance (T:8750), one of Japan's biggest investors, has cut holdings of stocks and increased currency hedging on foreign bonds as U.S.-China trade frictions have escalated beyond expectations, its investment chief said.
In an unusual move, the insurer has already drastically changed its market scenario and investment plan twice this financial year starting in April, Kazuyuki Shigemoto, chief general manager for investment, told Reuters.
Japanese insurers collectively hold 390 trillion yen ($3.7 trillion) of assets and their investment flows have a significant impact on the yen  and bond markets around the world.
U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff announcements, one in May to raise tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese imports and the other in August to slap new 10% tariffs on $300 billion of Chinese goods, were the triggers for the changes, he said.
""Back in April, we had expected a trade deal between the United States and China around June and thus we had bet on a rise in dollar/yen, stocks and interest rates. But Trump's tariffs announcement in May has changed the world,"" he said.
Shigemoto said it would likely keep its portfolio defensive. 
""You could say neither the United States nor China wants to push down their own economies forever, and therefore, they could reach a deal at some point. But even if that happens, we cannot see the economy recovering to levels before the start of the trade war,"" he said.
In the past, such a major change happened in November 2016, after Trump's surprising victory in the U.S. presidential elections, and in August 2015, when China's yuan devaluation jolted global markets, the investment head said. 
Dai-ichi Life does not plan to buy U.S. high-yield debt, despite its popularity among many bond investors globally as yields on government bonds in Europe and Japan have plunged into deep negative territory, given its cautious view on the economy and market.
But it looks to increase alternative assets, such as real estate investments because they retain decent returns.
""As a yen investor, it's a rare asset class that can deliver 3% yield despite the risk of price fluctuation,"" he said, referring to real estate assets.
Dai-ichi Life Insurance is Japan's second-largest private life insurer, with 36.6 trillion yen in assets under management as of end-June.

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Some Chinese business sectors reported solid first half earnings, though a substantial fall in industrial profits and in tepid overseas investment inflows into China's stock markets show fallout from the protracted trade war with the United States. 
Foreign portfolio inflows into stocks in the world's second largest economy have slowed dramatically. Stocks exposed to overseas markets and a weaker yuan have seen sustained selling while companies in the consumer and technology sectors have seen share prices rise as Beijing boosts domestic consumption and seeks technological independence. 
GRAPHIC: Foreign inflows decreased significantly amid trade tensions - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/buzzifr/14/5101/5101/Foreign%20inflows%20decreased%20significantly%20amid%20trade%20tensions.png
Inflows in January-August via the Stock Connect scheme with Hong Kong were about 120 billion yuan ($16.92 billion). That topped the year-earlier number, but was a fraction of the 600 billion yuan of 2019 inflows the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) expressed hope for at beginning of the year.
Global index provider MSCI is quadrupling the weighting of Chinese mainland shares in its global benchmarks this year, while FTSE Russell began adding China A-shares to its main emerging markets index in June. 
But industrial profits have slowed since 2018's second half as economic growth slipped to a near 30-year low.

Shares in machinery, electronics and home appliances firms, seen as vulnerable to trade tensions given their reliance on overseas markets, have been under selling pressure. 
BOE Technology (SZ:000725) is an example. The OLED display panel maker, which saw first-half profits plunge 44%, said it faced extremely severe challenges due to trade frictions and an industry downturn. 
As the trade war pushed the yuan  to an 11-year low, it hurt companies sensitive to currency moves, including real estate firms and airlines. The CSI300 real estate index <.CSI000952> dropped 7.1% in August as a weakening yuan made the property market less desirable for foreign investors.

Consumer firms were among China's better performing sectors as Beijing rolled out measures to stimulate China’s domestic consumption. Market bellwether Kweichow  Moutai  (SS:600519), a famous liquor maker, reported 27% profit growth. 
To offset effects of the trade war, Chinese policymakers rolled out measures including tax cuts and lower reserve requirements for banks, which were pushed to lend to smaller companies.

Tech firms, in focus after the United States imposed restrictions on major Chinese tech giants including Huawei Technologies, got a boost from China's continued push for technological independence, in particular the newly launched STAR Market board which is modeled after Nasdaq.
Leading tech firms, in particular those in the 5G industry chain, posted robust first half profit growth.

846,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 02, 2019 11:51PM ET</span>",India’s Megabank Mergers Seen Creating Better Value for Rivals,"(Bloomberg) -- Equity analysts predict that India’s move to merge several of its state banks will slow their loan growth, and many brokers advise buying shares of the lenders’ rivals who stand to benefit from the uncertainty.
While the mergers will reduce the number of state-owned banks to 12 from 27 and are aimed at creating bigger and healthier lenders, the time needed for integration and challenges related to staff, branch and process overlaps are expected to be the main immediate risks.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government late Friday surprised analysts by announcing a series of mergers that will create four new lenders that will hold business worth 55.8 trillion rupees ($781 billion), or about 56% of the Indian banking industry. The announcement came minutes before data showed economic growth in Asia’s third-biggest economy slumped to a six-year low of 5%, below the weakest estimate of 39 economists polled by Bloomberg.
Futures contracts on India’s Nifty 50 Index dropped 1% in Singapore on Monday, when local markets were shut, indicating the broader stock market may decline when they open for trade on Tuesday.
Here is what some of the analysts are saying:
Caution on Merger Candidates
Mergers will keep state-run banks “busy in the integration process for a prolonged period and thus help private banks further consolidate their business market share,” Emkay Global analysts Anand Dama and Rahul Malani wrote in a note dated Sept. 3. Emkay downgrades Indian Bank to hold from buy, and maintains sell on Punjab National Bank, Canara Bank and Union Bank, citing merger overhang. The analysts retain buy on SBI and a positive bias toward private banks, with ICICI Bank and HDFC Bank as top picks among large stocks.
Value Lies Outside
“Consolidation comes with its own set of challenges in HR, process integration, branch rationalization,” analysts led by Kunal Shah at Edelweiss Securities Ltd. in Mumbai, wrote in an investor note on Friday. “Ideally, value lies in places outside the involved banks and within this space, we like State Bank of India as it is better positioned to grow,” they wrote.
Loan Growth Slows
“We have observed that historically, when state-owned banks merge, smaller banks’ loan-book growth slows sharply, as the primary focus of management shifts to integration,” Vishal Goyal and Ishank Kumar, analysts at UBS Securities India Pvt., said in a note on Saturday. ICICI Bank Ltd. and Axis Bank Ltd. remain UBS’s most-preferred picks.
Smaller Lenders Lose
The mergers may not be favorable for the smaller lenders based on the share-swap ratios decided in past state-owned bank combinations, analysts led by Adarsh Parasrampuria at Nomura Financial Advisory & Securities (India) Pvt., wrote in a note on Saturday. “We continue to prefer private corporate banks such as ICICI and Axis Bank and we see value in State Bank, where merger-related uncertainty will not be there.”
Deepen Credit Crunch
“Consolidation is a good long-term move, but could weigh on near-term growth and potentially worsen the credit crunch,” analysts led by Sumeet Kariwala at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) wrote in a note on Monday. The brokerage remains underweight on Punjab National Bank and Canara Bank.
Credit Growth Pangs
Mergers are “unlikely to revive credit growth,”  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Group AG’s analysts Ashish Gupta and Kush Shah wrote in a note on Monday. “Given the limited flexibility on restructuring and rationalization, meaningful cost synergies from PSU bank mergers are unlikely,“ the note added.
Strengthening the System
 Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C). said the mergers “are significant and should strengthen the banking system in the medium to long term.” Fewer banks will mean the government’s capital infusion will be concentrated and will aid in talent management, analysts including Manish Shukla wrote in a note, upgrading shares of Bank of Baroda Ltd. to buy from neutral.
Faster Bad-Loan Resolution
“Near-term impacts could potentially be slower growth but faster NPL resolution, while medium-term impacts could include lower lending spreads in segments where SOE banks are market leaders,”  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). analyst Rahul Jain wrote in a note."
847,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 02, 2019 11:46PM ET</span>","ANZ, Citi, Deutsche cartel case inches ahead in Australia","SYDNEY (Reuters) - An Australian magistrate shifted hearings to a larger room as a long-awaited criminal cartel case against Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (AX:ANZ) and the local units of  Citigroup  (N:C) and  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) inched ahead on Tuesday.
Lawyers for each of the banks and individual executives packed out the Sydney courtroom for a short administrative hearing ahead of legal argument scheduled for later this month, giving a sense of the size and complexity of one of the country's biggest white collar crime prosecutions.
The case is being closely followed by brokers and banks globally because it could lead to increased regulator scrutiny.
Authorities last year charged the financial giants and six bankers over the 2015 sale of A$3 billion ($2 billion) ANZ shares and subsequent trading by underwriters, saying they colluded to keep from ordinary shareholders the fact that they had not found buyers for all the stock.
All the accused banks and executives have said they will fight the case, although they have not yet entered a formal plea. If they plead not guilty, the matter would proceed to trial, although no date has been set.
Magistrate Jennifer Atkinson said it appeared the court would need to make room for 20 barristers, an unusually large number in Australia, even for large cases.
The room of Sydney's Downing Centre Local Court normally used for early hearings of commonwealth matters was so crowded, lawyers had to stand behind the bar table that had room for just five chairs.
Atkinson also accepted commitments from lawyers on both sides to deliver briefs of evidence to each other a week before the next hearings scheduled for Sept. 25 and 27.
At those hearings, lawyers for the banks and bankers will press to be allowed to cross-examine prosecution witnesses, who have not been named yet in hearings.
If convicted, the banks could face penalties of A$10 million or triple the benefit of the conduct. The individuals charged could face 10 years in jail.
Citi and JP Morgan, which also worked on the 2015 share issue, declined to comment, while Deutsche and ANZ were not immediately available for comment."

Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index continued along its downward trend at the opening but recovered from mild sessions early in the morning session.

Over the weekend, new U.S. tariffs on about US$110 billion worth of Chinese goods took effect as did retaliatory Chinese tariffs of 5% to 10% on a range of U.S. goods. Markets seemed to take this latest escalation of the trade war in their stride and trading was thin. 
Still, on Monday, mainland China stocks got a bump after Beijing announced plans to keep “reasonably ample” liquidity, Bloomberg reported. 
However, Bloomberg also reported that trade officials on both sides of the dispute have been struggling to schedule a meeting planned for later this month, a challenge that sent U.S. futures lower and the dollar to two-year highs. 
Data from China out on Saturday also painted a gloomy outlook for the Chinese economy. Although the Caixin purchasing managers’ index (PMI) out on Monday suggested a surprise expansion of the economy with a reading of 50.4 for August and higher than the 49.8 expected by analysts polled by Reuters, the official PMI out on Saturday pointed to continued downward pressure with a reading for August of 49.5, down from 49.7 in July. 
Investors are now looking toward a monetary policy decision from Australia out on Tuesday. "
849,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 02, 2019 10:11PM ET</span>",Papua New Guinea to investigate terms of UBS loan,"By Jonathan Barrett
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Papua New Guinea will start preliminary hearings on Sept. 19 into the terms of a A$1.2 billion ($810.5 million) loan from Swiss bank UBS (S:UBSG) used for an ill-fated government investment in the gas sector, the inquiry's chairman said on Monday.
The timetable and terms of reference, released for the first time, also include a focus on how the UBS loan used to buy a government stake in PNG-focused energy firm Oil Search (AX:OSH) was obtained, whether it resembled previous loans, and whether the government broke its own rules in taking out the loan.
Chairman Salamo Injia, a former chief justice, said in a statement on Monday that retired Australian judge John Gilmour would also join the inquiry as a second commissioner.
""The appointments of (an) overseas commissioner and counsel were necessary given the international dimensions of the UBS transactions,"" Salamo said.
In 2014, the PNG government wanted to expand its exposure to the country's emerging gas industry by taking a 10% stake in Oil Search. Peter O'Neill was PNG's prime minister at that time. O'Neill resigned in May.
 Oil Search Limited  has a near one-third interest in the  Exxon Mobil  (N:XOM)-led PNG LNG Project, where gas is extracted from PNG's highlands region.
Questions were immediately raised in 2014 over whether the deal was overly complex, and if the PNG government followed correct legal procedures, sparking various internal inquiries.
The cash-strapped government went on to sell its stake after a prolonged period of weak oil and gas prices. The total sum of the financial loss has never been disclosed by the government.
PNG's new prime minister, James Marape, set up a new, powerful inquiry shortly after taking over as leader in May. He previously said the government had asked for an investigation to be concluded within three months.
Marape was finance minister at the time of the deal.
UBS did not immediately return an emailed request for comment.
It has previously said it would not comment on specific transactions and that it adhered to strict standards in banking operations.
Swiss financial watchdog FINMA said in March it was in contact with UBS about the loan."

China has been dogged by criticism of its restrictions on foreign banks which have hindered business expansion. The award of the licenses to the two banks comes as the country seeks to show progress in opening its markets amid an escalating Sino-U.S. trade war.

The new award will represent savings of $200 million from the first award in April, Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido's overseas legal representative said on Twitter on Monday.
A ConocoPhillips spokesman said the rectification lowered the award by $227 million and that the company ""does not challenge"" the action. 
""We remain committed to pursuing all available legal avenues to obtain a full and fair recovery of the award,"" the spokesman said. 
Guaido has prioritized protecting Venezuela's overseas assets since being recognized as the country's rightful leader by the United States and dozens of other countries this year. He has also requested that the World Bank's International Center for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) annul the award. 
Guaido argues that socialist President Nicolas Maduro is usurping power after winning a May 2018 election dismissed by the opposition and most Western democracies as a sham. Maduro calls Guaido a U.S.-backed puppet seeking to oust him in a coup. 

Jose Ignacio Hernandez, Guaido's legal representative who now represents Venezuela in the case, did not respond to requests for comment on the status of the annulment request.

852,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 02, 2019 05:17PM ET</span>","Argentine peso, bonds whiplashed after capital controls imposed","By Hugh Bronstein, Eliana Raszewski and Walter Bianchi
BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Argentine bond prices fell to record lows on Monday and the official and black market pesos diverged after the country imposed capital controls in a bid to stem a currency rout that is sharpening the risk of default.
The move on Sunday by President Mauricio Macri, a free-markets advocate who abolished capital controls after he came to power in 2015, was a sharp about-face for his administration after the conservative leader was pummeled in primary elections in August.
The country's peso, bonds and equities have since tumbled, forcing Macri to unveil plans to delay payments on around $100 billion of debts as well as the currency controls restricting the purchase of dollars.
The peso closed 0.88% stronger in official markets, but closed 0.79% weaker in the black market at 63.5 per dollar, a divergence underscoring a loss of trust in the official price that was also helped by a market holiday in the United States.
""The dollar at this level is now strong enough,"" Treasury Minister Hernan Lacunza told a news conference. ""All these measures have the central objective of stability.""
Central bank president Guido Sandleris on Monday called Argentina's financial system ""strong"" and said the bank would adhere to its strict monetary policy, despite the currency restrictions. 
Sandleris, speaking at a press conference, said the bank was in talks with the IMF to ""redefine"" the goals under its $57-billion financing agreement for September, though there have not yet been any changes. 
The official peso had lost more than 23% since the Aug. 11 primary election turned the country's politics on its head, with incumbent Macri getting thrashed by his populist-leaning opponent Alberto Fernandez. 
The currency is down more than a third so far this year, following a more than 50% drop last year. The central bank has burned through nearly $1 billion in reserves since Wednesday, but has failed to stem the peso's slide.

(Currency control: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/ARGENTINA-ECONOMY/0H001QETG86D/eikon.png) 
Fernandez is the clear front-runner ahead of the Oct. 27 general election. His vice presidential running mate is former President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, a free-spending populist who applied trade and currency controls during her two terms from 2007-2015.
Her presence on the ticket has caused concern about the return of the interventionist left to power, although the more moderate Alberto Fernandez has said he alone will set policy.
LONG LINES AT BANKS
Unusually long lines formed at banks in Buenos Aires on Monday, with depositors looking to withdraw dollars or pesos from their account, despite the government saying the financial system remains solid.
""All these people are taking out what they have, or part of what they have, because they'd rather keep their cash at home at this stage,"" 61-year-old depositor Julio Novoa told Reuters. 
Having announced changes to Argentina's bond payment schedule last week, the application of currency controls was the second measure by Macri that flew in the face of his promise to use orthodox policies to straighten out the chronically troubled economy. Macri's new controls may be difficult to back out of later, analysts said.
""The problem with restrictive, emergency measures is that they are easier to apply than to retract,"" said Buenos Aires-based financial analyst Christian Buteler in a tweet.
More peso weakness was expected ahead. ""The game has changed for the foreign exchange market,"" said Sabrina Corujo, an analyst with Buenos Aires brokerage Portfolio Personal, warning local stocks and bonds were set to weaken as well.
The central bank has been authorized to restrict purchases of dollars as it burns through its reserves to prop up the peso.
Macri won the presidency in 2015 on promises of ""normalizing"" Latin America's No. 3 economy by ditching the controls favored by the previous administration.
Argentina's benchmark international 2028 dollar bonds dropped more than 2 cents to a new low of 36.5 cents, according to Refinitiv data. Bonds maturing in 2038 recorded similar losses.
Argentina's euro-denominated sovereign bonds also suffered hefty losses to hit record lows. The 2022 bond dropped more than 10 cents to 34.45 cents while the 2027 issue tumbled 7.2 cents to 33.501 cents, according to Refinitiv data.
American depository receipts (ADRs) of Argentina's financial institutions also came under pressure. Grupo Financiero Galicia's Frankfurt-listing tumbled 9.15% while Banco Macro SA fell 6.5%.
Monday was a U.S. holiday, which could help control losses in Argentine asset prices by reducing trading volumes, Buteler tweeted.
The risk premiums demanded by investors to hold Argentina's dollar bonds over safe-haven U.S. Treasuries rocketed to 2,534 basis points on J.P. Morgan's index of hard-currency emerging market bonds. Those levels were last seen in the wake of a major 2001 default.
Capital controls are ""a sign of distress in the market and reflect that the new parameters on Argentina are weak and when the peso weakens further it weighs on the credit profile,"" said Michael Bolliger, head of asset allocation for emerging markets at UBS Wealth Management.

""There remains a lot of pressure on the currency ... There's a limit to what they can do without capital controls.""

854,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 02, 2019 02:16PM ET</span>","Hyundai workers OK smaller bonuses, no strike as Japan dispute weighs","By Hyunjoo Jin
SEOUL (Reuters) -  Hyundai Motor  Co's (KS:005380) unionized workers in South Korea voted on Monday to accept the lowest bonus offered in nearly two decades amid widespread restructuring in the auto industry and a damaging trade dispute with Japan.
With the approval, announced on Tuesday, Hyundai avoided a walkout by workers for the first time in eight years.
Hyundai's South Korean workers, who have staged strikes in all but four years since the union was created in 1987, had drawn media and public criticism for threatening to walk out despite their relatively high annual wage of 92 million won ($75,866) on average as of 2018, plus benefits and job security.
The deal came with tightened export curbs by Japan threatening to damage Asia's fourth-biggest economy, weighing on an auto industry already struggling with production cuts and job losses in the face of a slowdown in exports to the United States, Europe and other countries.
U.S. automaker General Motors Co (N:GM) last year closed one of its South Korean factories and reduced headcounts, while Renault's South Korean unit is bracing for production cuts.
In a statement issued after the vote results came out, union leaders thanked members for supporting their decision to hold off from staging a strike ""considering a U.S.-China trade war, a Korea-Japan economic war and the auto industry's downturn"".
Fifty-six percent of Hyundai workers who cast ballots approved the deal, which includes a bonus equivalent to one and a half months' salary plus 3 million won - totaling the lowest bonus payment since 2000, union officials said.
The deal, which also includes one-time payments of up to 6 million won to settle a legal dispute over wages, will be worth around 16.27 million won in total, according to a leaflet from one of union factions.
The deal will help Hyundai avert production losses in South Korea, at a time when Hyundai is expected to bounce back from six consecutive years' of profit decline, driven by favorable currency exchange and new sport-utility vehicles (SUVs).
South Korea accounts for 37% of Hyundai Motor's total production as of last year, with the automaker reducing its exposure to domestic production in favor of overseas output.
Meanwhile, other automakers are bracing for tough annual wage negotiations. GM wants to freeze a base wage this year for a second year in a row, a plan opposed by its South Korean union which has said it could stage a full strike this month.
 Renault  Samsung (KS:005930), a unit of French automaker Renualt SA (PA:RENA), also plans to cut production starting next month, with shipments of Nissan's Rogue SUV to the United States to be phased out this year, clouding job prospects."

856,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 02, 2019 01:26PM ET</span>",Bank of England eyes reform to make long-term investment more attractive,"By Huw Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - More realistic curbs on investors wanting to pull cash from funds could make investing in infrastructure more attractive and bolster economic growth, a senior Bank of England (BoE) official said on Monday.
The decision by high-profile British fund manager Neil Woodford to suspend his flagship equities fund has thrown a spotlight on such funds that offer daily redemptions.
The Woodford fund was unable to meet heavy demand from investors wanting their cash back even though it advertised itself as offering daily redemptions.
Alex Brazier, the BoE's executive director for financial stability, said investors had long favored putting money into funds that offer daily redemptions.
This has made it harder for funds in infrastructure and other ""illiquid"" or long-term assets to compete as they are unable to offer such speedy redemptions, Brazier said.
""So the unlevel playing field could have been a barrier to greater investment in patient forms of capital, a central tenet of the government's framework for raising productivity,"" Brazier said in a speech in Edinburgh.
For a ""fair and transparent fight"" between types of funds, the risk of suspension or dilution would be properly factored into the pricing and redemption terms of open-ended funds, Brazier said.
This could make funds that invest for the long term look relatively more attractive, Brazier said.
Following the Woodford suspension, the Bank of England, said it was looking how redemption terms in open-ended funds can better match the amount of time it takes to sell assets to raise cash.
""Pretending such investments are liquid when they are not creates dangers,"" Brazier said.
As the BoE review continues, ""we intend to have in mind not just how reform could promote financial stability, but also how it can promote the supply of productive finance too,"" Brazier said.
He reiterated the BoE's stance that the core of Britain's banking system could still continue to serve the economy, whatever form Brexit takes on Oct. 31. Markets are increasingly betting on a ""no-deal"" Brexit, given no divorce settlement has been agreed with the European Union.
Some backers of Brexit see Britain's departure from the EU as an opportunity to revisit financial rules that are currently written in Brussels.
Brazier said the way the EU bakes detailed rules into primary legislation meant they are ""inflexible"", but there is no need to weaken their substance.
""Looking ahead, we'll need a level of resilience in our system in future that's at least as great as currently planned,"" Brazier said."

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Swedish telecoms operator Telia has offered concessions to allow rivals fair access to its TV channels to address EU antitrust concerns about its $957 million bid for Bonnier Broadcasting, an EU document seen by Reuters showed.
Telia announced the Bonnier deal in July last year, underlining the telecoms industry's attempt to try to compete with big internet players such as Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) by acquiring media companies.
But EU competition enforcers expressed concerns about the deal such as the possibility of rivals being unable to access Bonnier's TV channels once the deal is completed, or blocked from accessing TV advertising space on its free-to-air and basic pay TV channels in the markets for retail mobile telecommunication, fixed internet and TV services.
To allay the European Commission's worries, Telia has offered to grant TV distributors in Sweden and Finland fair and reasonable access to its free-to-air and basic pay TV channels, according to the document.
Telia also offered fair access to its premium sports channels and the Liiga channel package which features the first division men's Finnish ice hockey league. 
Telia also pledged to grant a license to its TV channels to one internet provider in Sweden and Finland respectively, and committed to sell advertising space on its TV channels on fair and reasonable terms to telecoms providers and TV distributors in Sweden and Finland.
The concessions are likely to assuage regulatory concerns and ensure the deal gets through, said a person familiar with the matter.
The Commission, which is scheduled to decide on the deal by Nov. 19, declined to comment.
Telia said: ""In order not to interfere with this process, we do not want to go into detail about what concessions have been offered."" 

Bonnier's brands include Sweden's biggest commercial broadcaster TV4, streaming service C More and Finnish MTV. It competes with state broadcaster SVT. Critics have cited media plurality in Sweden and Finland as one reason for concerns about the deal.

893,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 02, 2019 11:56AM ET</span>",Positive yields ahoy! Investors hoover up European junk bond issues,"By Abhinav Ramnarayan
LONDON (Reuters) - Junk-rated firms  Smurfit Kappa  (I:SKG) and Thyssenkrupp (DE:TKAG) were overwhelmed with demand when they kicked off post-summer proceedings for the European high-yield market on Monday, as yield-starved investors piled into the new issues.
With much of the European bond market now in negative-yielding territory, investors are being forced down the credit spectrum - allowing the likes of Smurfit Kappa and Thyssenkrupp to price deals at levels rarely seen before.
Packaging firm Smurfit Kappa caught the eye with its plans to sell 750 million euros ($835.80 million) of eight-year bonds at 1.5%, some of the lowest yields clocked in the European junk bond market for a new issue, particularly for one of such a long maturity.
The company was able to achieve this on the back of a 3.9 billion euro order book - allowing it to upsize from the original 500 million euro target.
Germany's Thyssenkrupp was set to raise 1 billion euros from the sale of a 3.5-year bond issue at an expected yield of around 2%, with orders exceeding 2.75 billion euros at one stage, according to leads.
Investors have been forced down the credit spectrum in the past few months as expectations of a European Central Bank rate cuts and asset purchases have pushed a large chunk of the European bond market into negative-yielding territory.
More than a third of European investment-grade debt is negative yielding, according to Tradeweb, driving the market toward the more speculative assets such as junk-rated bonds.
""For those who are watching this market closely, these levels won't come as a surprise because we have seen how this market is trading,"" said one banker who is managing the Thyssenkrupp trade, preferring to remain anonymous as he is not allowed to speak publicly about his clients.
""But certainly it sets down a marker for September, and it will be interesting to see what happens when you move from the crossover names to the lower-rated ones,"" he added.
Smurfitt Kappa -- BB+ from S&P Global and Fitch -- and Thyssenkrupp -- BB- from S&P Global and BB+ from Fitch -- both fall into the ""crossover"" area, a term used to describe companies that are on either side of line that divides investment grade from junk.
Still, the kind of yield being achieved is raising a few eyebrows.
""Some high yield managers will be buying this debt as part of their strategy, but generally speaking a lot of other investors are just forced into this because of the paucity of options,"" said Colin Hart, a portfolio manager and head of research on the multi-asset team at  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) Asset Management. He was referring to the vast quantities of European debt that is yielding below zero in the investment-grade category.
""A lot of people are buying this on a short-term view that yields could go even lower. The longer-term, wider debate about how long it can last is only just starting,"" he said.
Other European high-yield issuers have sold bonds at similar yields to Smurfit Kappa, but not usually for quite such a long maturity.
Salini Impregilo sold a seven-year 500 million euro bond at 1.75% in September 2017 at the height of the ECB's corporate bond purchase program. Although the ECB did not buy junk debt, its purchases of investment-grade bonds pushed other investors into the high-yield market.
More recently, Germany's Adler (DE:ADDG) sold a 400 million euro three-year bond at 1.5% and France's Fnac Darty (PA:FNAC) a five-year bond callable after two years at 1.875%.,
In the case of Thyssenkrupp, observers said the bond deal came at a significant discount to the industrial firm's outstanding bonds.
This is still an achievement given how much pressure the company has been under from ratings agencies recently as it looks to shed some of its prized assets to bolster some of its remaining businesses."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - When Rupert Murdoch's  Fox Corp  (O:FOXA) launches the FOX Bet sports betting platform on Monday, it will do what no other major media company has done in North America: become the face of a sports gambling platform.
FOX Bet, which launches in New Jersey, is operated through a partnership with gaming provider The Stars Group (TSG) (TO:TSGI). It lent its splashy national name brand recognition, stars, expert commentary and news to attract casual betters.
Entertainment giants from Walt  Disney  Co (N:DIS) to AT&T Inc's (N:T) WarnerMedia have waded into the red hot sports betting arena, which experts project could generate $9 billion of revenue over the next few years in gambling revenue.
But most have relied on creating new shows and providing commentary and have kept an arms-length distance from actual gambling.
Big media companies are worried that crossing the line into letting its viewers place bets could damage their brands if it comes off as disreputable, experts said.
""Those are pretty heavy questions, especially for multibillion-dollar media behemoths that aren't accustomed to turning on a dime,"" said Chris Grove, a managing director at analytics firm Eilers & Krejcik Gaming LLC.
Fox comes to the field with experience. It is Murdoch's third foray with fronting a sports betting service. Murdoch's Sky, now owned by Comcast Corp (O:CMCSA), struck a similar deal with TSG to create Sky Bet, a U.K. sports betting partnership.
""They can point to that model and say, this looks successful in the U.K.,"" Grove said.
FOX bet will target casual betters and smaller wagers, similar to Sky Bet, and be a tool for Fox Sports to engage fans, FOX Bet Chief Executive Officer Robin Chhabra told Reuters ahead of the launch.
Another quality the apps will share: users can request a bet through social media platforms with the hashtag #CustomBet.
But there are risks for media companies diving into sports betting.
Sun Bets, another partnership between the Murdoch-owned newspaper The Sun, a unit of News Corp (O:NWSA), and Australian gambling group Tabcorp Holdings (AX:TAH), closed in 2018 after disappointing financial performance.
However, the lure of ad revenue and a potential to engage fans more deeply in live sports broadcasts inspired another go at it for media companies.
Another media company is also racing to launch a new sports betting platform in time for the start of the U.S. football season. The National Football League starts regular season play on Thursday.
TheScore Inc (V:SCR), a small Toronto-based sports news app, plans to launch and run its own sportsbook, blurring the line even more between media company and gambling operator.
The activity comes after a U.S. Supreme Court decision in May 2018 that overturned a federal ban on sports wagering outside of Nevada, and 13 states now offer it.
FOX Bet launched its app on Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Inc's iOS platform and on Google's Android operating system in New Jersey and is expected to later roll out in other states.
FOX Sports Chief Executive Officer and Executive Producer Eric Shanks spearheaded the TSG partnership.
Fox employees have been working closely with TSG developers on the app, joining daily production meetings and integrating branding and talent, Chhabra said.
Fox in May invested $236 million for a 4.99% stake in TSG.
TSG expects to break even in 2022 on FOX Bet, with $40 million invested this year, including $10 million licensing fees in each New Jersey and Pennsylvania, Chhabra said.
Separately, FOX Sports is also expected to offer a free-to-play predictive game nationally."

The filing makes official a pledge Sewing made in July, when he announced a major restructuring of the bank. 
Sewing said at the time he would invest a ""substantial amount"" of his fixed salary in the bank. The CEO, who is shaking up  Deutsche Bank  to try to revive its profitability, said in July he wanted to put his money where his mouth was. 
Sewing will buy roughly 21,250 euros ($23,681.00) in shares around the 22nd of each month through to the end of 2022, the filing said. That would result in a total investment of around 850,000 euros, based on monthly purchases up to the end of 2022.
Deutsche Bank shares hit a record low of 5.78 euros per share on Aug. 16. At 1203 GMT on Monday, Deutsche's shares were at 6.64 euros each, up 1.1%. They are down 4.7% so far this year. 
Last month, Deutsche Bank Chairman Paul Achleitner bought nearly 1 million euros of the bank's shares.

The steelmaker proposed to close its loss-making Orb Electrical Steels site in South Wales, potentially affecting up to 380 jobs, as it was ""unable to find a way forward"" for the business, it said in a filing https://www.bseindia.com/xml-data/corpfiling/AttachLive/0a50d7de-01e7-4f84-8cde-8d9b0f874ce0.pdf to Indian stock exchanges.
Tata put up five of its non-core businesses in Europe on sale in May 2018 as it looked to focus on its strip products business.
Orb is part of one of these businesses, Cogent, which makes electrical steels.
""Continuing to fund substantial losses at Orb Electrical Steels is not sustainable at a time when the European steel industry is facing considerable challenges,"" said Henrik Adam, chief executive officer of Tata Steel's European operations.
The company saw no prospects of the business returning to profitability in the coming years, Adam said.
Tata Steel said it would cost the company more than 50 million pounds ($61.39 million) to upgrade the site to produce steel for electric vehicle production.
Unite, UK's largest trade union, said in a statement https://unitetheunion.org/news-events/news/2019/september/unite-demands-tata-steel-assurances-over-closure-of-newport-site it has sought assurances that there would be no compulsory redundancies from Tata Steel after the steelmaker announced Orb's closure.
Tata added it had signed a deal to sell Cogent Power, another division of Cogent, to Japan's JFE Shoji Trade Corp.
It also plans to close another non-core business, Wolverhampton Engineering Steels Service Centre, as it did not find a buyer. This could cost up to 26 jobs, it said.
The news comes weeks after Turkey's military pension fund OYAK reached a provisional agreement to take over British Steel, which Greybull Capital bought for one pound from Tata Steel three years ago, potentially saving thousands of jobs.
British Steel was put into compulsory liquidation on May 22 after Greybull Capital failed to secure funding to continue its operations."

LONDON (Reuters) - Global markets remained subdued on Monday after the United States and China imposed new tariffs on each other, while the spotlight returned to emerging-market risk as Argentina imposed capital controls.
Argentina's international dollar bonds dropped to record lows, its financial stocks tumbled and risk premia shot up after President Mauricio Macri re-imposed capital controls on Sunday as the country battled to avoid its ninth sovereign default.
The about-face by Macri, who had previously lifted many protectionist practices of his predecessor, Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, came after the government failed to stem heavy investment outflows and to shore up its tumbling currency.
MSCI's All-Country World Index, which tracks shares across 47 countries, was down 0.04% on the day.
U.S. markets were shut for a holiday on Monday. European shares ticked higher as surprisingly positive data helped China weather the latest round of tit-for-tat tariffs between the United States and China that came into effect over the weekend. 
Washington imposed 15% tariffs on a variety of Chinese goods and China began to impose new duties on a $75 billion target list. However, both sides will still meet for talks later this month, U.S. President Donald Trump said.
Trade-sensitive German shares were 0.4% higher and the pan-European stocks benchmark index STOXX 600 was up 0.63% by midday in London, beginning September higher. It fell 1.6% in August as the trade war intensified. 
""Despite the market's sanguine take, we believe the ultimate outlook for the trade dispute has become harder to predict with confidence,"" said Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management. 
""Since trade tensions have become the major driving force for stocks, even greater than monetary policy, we advise against adding significantly to equity exposure – particularly for those who have an adequate strategic allocation."" 
Income-generating carry positions such as select emerging market currencies will perform well as central banks ease policy in response to weaker growth, Haefele added. 
Euro zone manufacturing activity contracted for a seventh month in August as declining demand sapped optimism, a survey showed, strengthening expectations for monetary easing by the European Central Bank next week.
At its July meeting, the ECB all but promised to ease policy as the growth outlook worsened.
Italian bond yields fell toward recent multi-year lows after Italy's prime minister said at the weekend talks on a new government should be completed by Wednesday. The 5-Star Movement and the Democratic Party held talks over the weekend on cabinet posts and a common agenda.
In currency markets, the dollar was 0.1% higher against a basket of peers. 
The euro was 0.2% lower at $1.09665 (EUR=), not far from two-year low of $1.0963 hit in U.S. trade on Friday.
TRADE WAR 
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan dropped 0.24%, led by 0.5% drop in Hong Kong's Hang Seng (HSI) after another weekend of violent anti-government protests.
Chinese shares rose, however, with the CSI300 index (CSI300) gaining 1.1% despite the trade row escalation. A pledge by China's State Council to boost support for the economy helped.
Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), a private sector survey, on Monday showed factory activity unexpectedly expanded in August, though gains were modest and contrasted with official data that pointed to further contraction.
Washington imposed tariffs on a variety of Chinese goods and while Beijing imposed new duties on U.S. crude, the latest escalation in a bruising trade war. Studies suggest the tariffs will cost U.S. households up to $1,000 a year. 
Many market players say the market's reaction was likely exaggerated by algorithm-driven players' flows in thin trading at the start of Asian trade on Monday. Liquidity could be even more limited than usual because of a U.S. holiday on Monday. 
""(The market move) goes to show you how many data mining algos are involved with equity-linked compared with forex-linked. Was anyone surprised by these tariffs that took effect yesterday?"" said Takeo Kamai, head of execution at CLSA in Tokyo.
Tension is also running high in Hong Kong. Police and protesters clashed in some of the most intense violence since unrest erupted more than three months ago.
Thousands of protesters blocked roads and public transport links to Hong Kong airport and police made several arrests after demonstrators smashed CCTV cameras and lamps and dismantled station turnstiles. 
China, eager to quell the unrest before the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China on Oct. 1, has accused foreign powers, particularly the United States and Britain, of fomenting the unrest.

Oil prices fell on Monday. Brent crude futures dropped 0.15% to $59.16 a barrel; U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were flat at $55.1.

The conditions are part of the latest agreement reached between the German carmaker and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) about Volkswagen's business in the United States after the company in 2015 admitted using illegal software to cheat U.S. pollution tests.
The scandal, which became known as Dieselgate, triggered a global backlash against diesel vehicles that has so far cost Volkswagen 30 billion euros ($33 billion) in fines, penalties and buyback costs.
German business daily Handelsblatt was first to report VW's latest agreement with the EPA on Monday.
Volkswagen said the agreement entails the prequalification of VW for public sector contracts, in exchange for installing a new monitor for up to three years in a process due to begin this autumn.
""This deal recognizes the comprehensive measures that our company has been taking since 2015 to strengthen our compliance and risk management. It allows our subsidiaries to continue to do business with U.S. authorities,"" Volkswagen said in an internal statement to managers, made available to Reuters.
The agreement is important for VW's MAN Energy Solutions subsidiary which produces big diesel engines, some of which are used by the U.S. Navy and coastguard, while the group's general activities in the U.S. public sector are small, the spokesman said.
Since 2017, VW has been disclosing legal violations around the test manipulations to an external compliance monitor, Larry Thompson, a former deputy U.S. attorney general, and taking steps to change compliance and conduct. Thompson employed up to 100 specialists at one stage.
The second monitoring process, to be led by John Hanson of Artifice Forensic Financial Services, would be smaller in reach, less staff-intensive and less comprehensive than Thompson's.
Hanson could take Thompson's findings as a basis, the VW spokesman said. Both are former employees of the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) which Thompson used to serve as director in an earlier role.

900,By Investing.com,"<span>Sep 02, 2019 06:27AM ET</span>",StockBeat: Europe Markets Start Month Brightly as PMIs Stabilize,"By Geoffrey Smith
Investing.com -- Europe’s bourses got off to a broadly positive start for September after a slew of business surveys showed most of the region’s manufacturing sector starting to stabilize, despite still suffering from the effects of the U.S.-China trade war.
The big outlier was the U.K., where manufacturing activity took another dive in August amid an increasingly febrile atmosphere around Brexit. IHS Markit’s monthly purchasing managers’ index fell to a new seven-year low of 47.4, down from 48.0 last month. Analysts had hoped for an upturn to 48.4.
IHS Markit said the decline was due primarily to an “accelerated contraction in new work”, which bodes ill for the rest of the year. It noted that the businesses whose responses make up the survey said some EU-based customers had begun to re-route their supply chains away from the U.K. in anticipation of the scheduled departure of the U.K. from the EU at the end of October. However, it also noted that demand from the U.S. and Asia had weakened.
In addition, it noted that over 80% of respondents had mentioned sterling’s weakening inflation in connection with rising input prices. IHS Markit director Rob Dobson said the figures were consistent with a 2% drop in quarterly output.
The U.K. FTSE 100 still rose 1.1% by 5 AM ET (0900 GMT), partly a reflection of the hit delivered to sterling, which fell 0.3% against the euro and 0.6% against the dollar. U.K. assets are likely to stay volatile this week as parliament returns from its summer recess. Opponents of the government's willingness to leave the EU without a transitional deal are expected to propose legislation to rule out such an outcome on Tuesday, according to The Times of London.
The broader Stoxx 600 benchmark was up 0.4% at 380.90, its highest in a month, after final PMI readings for the euro zone and its biggest economies were little changed from preliminary data. Italy’s PMI ticked up slightly but remained in contractionary territory at 48.7, versus 48.5 in July. The FTSE MIB continued to outperform, however, as the center-left Democratic Party and Five Star Movement moved ever closer to formalizing a new coalition government.
Germany’s DAX and France’s CAC 40 both rose 0.1%, the former left unmoved by two regional elections at the weekend at which the right-wing populist AfD party made substantial gains – albeit not big enough to allow it to declare itself the winner.
Trading is expected to stay relatively thin due to the U.S. Labor Day holiday."

M&S shares, which have been part of the FTSE 100 since its inception in 1984, have lost about 40% of their value since January 2018 as the icon of the British high street has struggled with tough competition in both clothing and food, particularly online.

Baring Vostok has been in the spotlight since the arrest earlier this year of several of its executives including U.S. investor Michael Calvey on embezzlement charges. They deny wrongdoing and say the case is being used against them in a corporate dispute over control of Vostochny Bank.
Vostochny Bank had requested the seizure of more than 334 billion shares held by a firm controlled by Baring Vostok, documents from the arbitration court of Russia's far eastern Amur region said.
Baring, which ceded a 9.99% stake in Vostochny Bank and lost its status as majority shareholder in June, holds a 41.6% stake in Vostochny.
Vostochny Bank said it the seizure of the stake had been necessary to prevent Baring Vostok selling shares in Vostochny before a court decision.
Baring Vostok said it would appeal the decision.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Singapore is pursuing more foreign tech talent as it ramps up efforts to grow the sector, its trade minister said on Monday, adding that locals would also benefit from the plans amid concerns about preserving jobs as the economy sours.
The Asian city-state is already home to the regional offices of hundreds of tech companies like Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), a cluster it hopes to grow into a global tech hub and make the ""linchpin"" of its future economy.
""We are accelerating our efforts to develop our tech talent,"" Trade Minister Chan Chun Sing told parliament.
""Demand for tech talent is far outstripping the local supply... We need to complement our local pipeline with skilled workers from all around the world.""
Chan was responding to a question about whether a scheme aimed at helping firms hire foreign tech talent, called Tech@SG, was necessary given slowing growth and the government's stated focus on hiring and developing local jobs.
""We are deeply cognisant of the fact that this topic can be easily stirred up because of the emotions involved and because it concerns jobs... However, we must not go down the path of other countries who have started to put up barriers and take an inward-looking, protectionist approach,"" Chan said.
He said stepping up efforts to grow the tech sector was ""precisely because of the uncertainties with the economic outlook"".
Foreign labor has long been a socially sensitive topic in Singapore, which is due to hold an election in the next 18 months. It was seen as one of the biggest issues for voters in the ruling party's worst election result in 2011.
Singapore has been tightening conditions for hiring foreign professionals in recent years, and said in February quotas for foreign workers in the services sector would be further reduced. (https://reut.rs/30SI9PI) (https://reut.rs/34kvqHF)
Risks of a looming recession with growth rates at a decade-low and a slight uptick in citizen unemployment - although low by global standards at 3.3% - have brought the issue back into the limelight.

Asian equities are also following the lead of U.S. markets, which closed moderately up on Friday, the last trading day in August but are poised to drop on Tuesday. U.S. markets are closed Monday for the Labor Day holiday. Japan’s Nikkei 225 lost 0.39% by 9:30 PM ET (01:30 GMT).

U.S. tariffs on US$110 billion in Chinese imports took effect on Sunday and a set of Chinese retaliatory tariffs also took effect.
Data from China out on Saturday that showed a fall in the official purchasing managers' index (PMI) suggested that the second-largest economy in the world continues to face downward pressure from a combination of trade tension with the U.S. and generally weaker demand. S&P 500 Futures were down 0.6%. The official PMI for August came in at 49.5, down from 49.7 in July.
However, the Caixin China General Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI), released Monday morning, recorded an increase to 50.4 in August (with a number over 50 signalling expansion) up from 49.9 in July.
Softening the blow, the official non-manufacturing PMI rose for the first time in five months. The National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said the gauge rose to 53.8 in August from 53.7 in July, staying above the 50 level and showing expansion.
In Hong Kong, markets have been pressured by ongoing political unrest. The weekend saw some of the most intense violence to date, with protesters fighting with police throughout the city, damaging subway stations and forcing stoppages to the city's transit system and engaging in pitched battles with riot police. In turn, police stepped up the pressure with arrests and a more aggressive approach to protests and rallies. Investors were also keeping an eye on the impact of a general strike planned for Hong Kong on Monday.
However, Chinese business publication Caixin reported that investors from mainland China have been buying up Hong Kong stocks, with the value of shares bought surpassing the value of stocks sold for 16 weeks in a row. That's the longest buying streak in about 18 months and coincides with an 8.6% drop in the Hang Seng Index.
Hong Kong’s stock market was the worst performer in the world in August, with a 7.4% fall. All told, the Hang Seng is down more than 15% from a peak of 30, 280 on April 15."
909,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 01, 2019 09:06PM ET</span>",Lawyers seek $26 million in Volkswagen U.S. fuel economy settlement,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Lawyers for owners of 98,000 Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p) U.S. vehicles that had fuel economy labels that overstated efficiency will ask a U.S. judge for $26 million in attorney's fees and costs, court documents show.
On Friday, the Environmental Protection Agency said the largest German automaker must forfeit greenhouse gas emissions credits and lower the fuel economy ratings on those vehicles after it said vehicle software overstated real-world performance.
Volkswagen said on Friday it had agreed to a $96.5 million court settlement to reimburse 98,000 consumers. People who still own the vehicles are eligible for lump-sum payments ranging from $518.40 to $2,332.80 per vehicle.
The $26 million request, which involves $23.9 million in fees and $2.1 million in expenses, is separate from the $96.5 million, court filings show, while any uncollected consumer funds will be directed to ""environmental remediation efforts.""
The settlement came after 15 months of negotiations.
The EPA said Volkswagen's software lowered the fuel economy rating on 98,000 vehicles by about one mile per gallon, or 3.5%.
The software was on about 1 million 2013-2017 model year Audi, Bentley, Porsche and Volkswagen vehicles, the agency said. It caused the transmission to shift gears in a manner that sometimes optimizes fuel economy and greenhouse gas emissions during the EPA-prescribed emissions test, but not under normal driving conditions, the agency said.
The vehicles getting lower ratings - and eligible for compensation - include versions of the Audi A8, Bentley Continental GT, Porsche Cayenne and VW Touareg. Not all of the five model years are covered by the court settlement.
The EPA said Volkswagen understated greenhouse gas emissions by about 220,000 metric tons and it would forfeit EPA credits and credits in the federal Corporate Average Fuel Economy program.
The issue was discovered during an investigation by the EPA and California Air Resources Board into excess diesel emissions in hundreds of thousands of U.S. vehicles.
The German automaker admitted using illegal software to cheat U.S. pollution tests in 2015, triggering a global backlash against diesel vehicles that has so far cost it 30 billion euros ($33 billion) in fines, penalties and buyback costs. In May, it set aside an additional 5.5 billion euros in contingent liabilities.
Lawyers suing VW and Robert Bosch GmbH (ROBG.UL) in the United States over the diesel emissions scandal previously received $352 million in fees and costs."

912,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 01, 2019 05:40AM ET</span>","Market Fragility On Show as Trade War, China Data Curb Optimism","(Bloomberg) -- The trade war just ratcheted up another notch and the outlook for Chinese manufacturing deteriorated further, signaling the caution that characterized a tumultuous August for global markets may have further to run.
The ground is laid for a volatile start to September, exacerbated by the U.S. Labor Day holiday on Monday crimping trading volume with Treasuries and equity markets shut. In the Asia Pacific region, all eyes will be on shares of Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). suppliers and clothing manufacturers to gauge the reception to this latest round of tariff hikes.
“This is the mother of all questions: Is Mr. Trump going to escalate or de-escalate over the next year?” Luciano Jannelli, head of investment strategy at Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank, told Bloomberg TV on Sunday. “It’s difficult to say.”
The U.S. implemented 15% tariffs on about $110 billion in apparel, footwear and other Chinese imports on Sunday. Face-to-face talks between American and Chinese trade negotiators scheduled for Washington this month were still on track, President Donald Trump told reporters on Friday.
According to Bloomberg Intelligence estimates, Chinese exports of shoes and clothing to the U.S. could drop by more than 3% year-on-year in the second half of this year as a result of the tariffs.
Further Complications
“The tensions will escalate and many official bank house views that had a U.S.-China trade deal over time as the base-case scenario might have to revise this as the clashes in Hong Kong further complicate any discussion between the Trump administration and the Chinese Communist Party,” said Rainer Michael Preiss, a portfolio strategist at Taurus Wealth Advisors Pte.
Data Saturday showed the manufacturing sector of the world’s second-largest economy remains under pressure. China’s purchasing managers’ index dropped to 49.5, marking the fourth consecutive month of contraction in factory output.
The latest tariffs that came into effect on Sunday were widely anticipated and may already be reflected in market prices.
“The market expected the tariffs” to kick in, said Kerry Goh, CEO and CIO of Kamet Capital Partners Pte., a Singapore-based multi-family office. “I don’t think there will be a big move” on Monday.
For Jingyi Pan, a strategist at IG Asia Pte., it remains prudent to play defensive.
“It does appear that the disagreements between the two sides will drag on with negotiations yet to lead to any way out of the current gridlock,” she said.
Here are a few areas to monitor in trading on Monday:
Apple suppliers
The new duties will hit Apple products that made up at least 10% of sales in the company’s 2018 fiscal year, such as the Apple Watch, AirPods and iMac computers, according to Bloomberg analysis. Shares of Foxconn Technology Group, the U.S. company’s main assembly partner, and Luxshare Precision Industry Co., which provides components for wearable devices like the Apple Watch, could be volatile in Monday trading, said Taurus Wealth’s Preiss.
A more than 7% surge for gold in August may have further to go after ending last month at about $1,520 an ounce. “It’s not just the tariffs but the Hong Kong unrest that could lead to renewed buying interest in gold,” said Preiss. The Singapore-based executive said gold could hit $2,000 over the next 12 months, bolstered by trade woes and further interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve.
China stocks
Apparel and footwear manufacturers that derive revenues from Chinese exports to the U.S. are in the line of fire. Hong Kong-listed Yue Yuen Industrial Holdings Ltd., for one, makes about 13% of its shoes in China and is one of the largest shoemakers for  Nike  (NYSE:NKE) and Adidas (DE:ADSGN) globally, according to Bloomberg Intelligence."

August' s figure was 24.3 billion panaceas ($3.01 billion), Macau's Gaming Inspection and Coordination said in data posted on Sunday, below analysts' expectations of a drop of 2%-6%.
The figure was slightly lower than July's monthly revenue of 24.4 billion panaceas.
While protests in the Asian financial hub of Hong Kong have disrupted transport and deterred travel to the former British colony and then on to Macau, analysts say the impact on gaming revenues has been minimal.
However, the protests have added to the impact of factors such as a typhoon earlier in the month that hit China's coastal cities and tightening liquidity in the high-roller VI sector.
Macau's biggest junket operator, Sun city, which operates VI gambling rooms around Asia, was singled out by state media in July as raking in billions of dollars in online gaming and proxy betting, ""causing great harm to China’s social economic order"".
""The negativity surrounding Sun city continues to pressure junket VI, as some agents withdraw some funds and some VI players delay visiting Macau,"" said Vital Umansky, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein in Hong Kong."

""We're helping Poland to reduce its dependence on Russian gas,"" U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry told a news conference in Warsaw after meeting officials from Poland and Ukraine. 
The Polish government official responsible for energy infrastructure, Piotr Naimski, said Poland, which has increased purchases of liquefied natural gas (LNG) from the United States in recent years, would be able to send six billion cubic meters of gas to Ukraine starting from 2021 compared to the current capability of 1.5 bcm.
""We will take every effort to diversify gas supplies to Ukraine, which is now completely dependent on Russian deliveries,"" Naimski told the same conference. 
Perry, Naimski and Ukraine's Secretary of National Security Oleksandr Danylyuk signed a memorandum of understanding to enhance security of gas supplies in the region via LNG supplies from the U.S. through Poland's and Ukraine's infrastructure which still has to be expanded. 
Under a policy it calls energy dominance, the administration of President Donald Trump, who canceled his trip to Warsaw earlier this week, is seeking to slash domestic regulations on energy production to boost oil and gas exports to allies and trade partners.
It is seeking to offer Europe alternative sources of gas to fuel sent via pipeline from Russia, which is generally cheaper than U.S. LNG, but has not always been reliable with Russia at times stopping deliveries to Ukraine and parts of Europe during pricing disputes.
More than a third of Russia's gas exports to the European Union cross Ukraine, which traditionally uses some of the gas pumped by Russia to European consumers for its own needs in eastern and central regions.
But the Russia-Ukraine gas transit agreement is due to expire in January and Ukrainian energy authorities are worried that Moscow could stop gas supplies through Ukraine, leaving some Ukrainian regions without gas in winter.
Also Poland, which is seen as one of Washington's closest allies in Europe, still buys most of the gas it consumes from Russia, has taken steps to cut this reliance after 2022 when its long-term deal on gas supplies from Gazprom (MM:GAZP) expires.
Poland's imports of LNG, including from the U.S., via the Baltic Sea terminal at Swinoujscie have jumped in recent years as part of a wider plan to cut reliance on Russian supplies. 

Earlier this week Poland's state-run gas firm PGNiG (WA:PGN) said that it bought a cargo of liquefied natural gas from the U.S. and sold it to Ukraine.

JACKSONVILLE. FL. (Reuters) - Hurricane Dorian spun west on Saturday, putting Georgia and the Carolinas in the path of a possible landfall as well as Florida, where some beaches were all but deserted on the holiday weekend as visitors braced for the dangerous category 4 storm.
The Miami-based National Hurricane Center said there had been a ""notable change"" since Friday night, with the latest forecasts showing the eye of the storm could veer north and stay out at sea.
But it warned that its course remained unpredictable. Dorian still poses a threat to millions of people, as well as holiday attractions such as Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) World, the NASA launchpads along the Space Coast, and even President Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach.
The NHC said Dorian was packing maximum sustained winds of 150 mph (240 kph) and was expected to pass north of the southeastern and central Bahamas on Sunday and be near Florida's east coast late Monday through Tuesday.
Of immediate concern were Bahamas tourist hotspots Great Abaco and Grand Bahamas, where up to two days of hurricane-force winds were set to start on Sunday as Dorian slowed to a 2 mph (3.2 kph) crawl.
""This is a very dangerous situation for the Bahamas,"" NHC Director Ken Graham said in a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) Live video.
After so much focus on a possible Florida landfall, Graham said other southeast U.S. states now had to be on alert.
""Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina have got to pay attention as well,"" he said.
The governors of Florida, Georgia and North Carolina have all declared states of emergency. 
On Florida's east coast, popular surfing spot Cocoa Beach was quiet as tourists stayed away, while locals worked on putting up hurricane shutters and buying supplies ranging from water to power generators.
""It's pretty slow, there's not many people on the beach,"" said Alex Hendricks, a saleswoman at the Cocoa Beach Surf Company.
In the Bahamas, most tourists who planned to leave had already gone after Freeport's international airport was scheduled to shut down at 10 p.m. on Friday. 
The NHC urged Florida residents to remain on alert.
""It should be noted that the new forecast track does not preclude Dorian making landfall on the Florida coast, as large portions of the coast remain in the track cone of uncertainty,"" the center cautioned on Saturday.
Trump said South Carolina, North Carolina and Georgia could all be hit harder by the storm than had been previously expected.

""It's moving around and very hard to predict, except that it is one of the biggest and strongest (and really wide) that we have seen in decades. Be safe!"" Trump wrote on Twitter.

919,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 31, 2019 11:05AM ET</span>","UAE firms scout trade at Syria fair, defying U.S. pressure","By Kinda Makieh
DAMASCUS (Reuters) - A delegation of at least 40 businessmen from the United Arab Emirates attended a state-backed trade fair in Syria's capital, defying U.S. warnings against doing business with the government and associates of President Bashar al-Assad.
The UAE, one of Washington's main regional allies, has started to forge closer ties with Damascus to counter the influence of its rivals Iran and Turkey. In December, it reopened its embassy there, angering Washington.
Representatives attended from companies such as construction firm Arabtec Holding, and other investment firms headed by prominent Emirati businessmen, as well as members of the chambers of commerce, delegates said.
The delegates left Damascus on Thursday and Friday.
During the war, the UAE did support armed groups opposed to Assad. But its role was less prominent than that of Saudi Arabia and Qatar, and mainly centered on ensuring that Islamist forces did not dominate the uprising.
Businesses are exploring trade possibilities and assessing their aims and budget, said Farouk Assassa, Senior Administration Manager at Essa Al-Ghurair, a Dubai-based supply chain provider and trader of agricultural commodities. 
""This issue will take time to determine, but everything happens gradually,"" he told Reuters TV in Damascus.
He said he was not worried about the U.S. warning that companies dealing with the Syrian government could face sanctions. The large size of the UAE delegation showed others shared his view, he said.
The U.S. Embassy in Syria wrote on Twitter on Aug. 27 that it had received reports that some regional businessmen or chambers of commerce planned to participate in the fair. 
""We reiterate our warning that anyone doing business (with the) Assad regime or its associates is exposing themselves to the possibility of US sanctions,"" it said.
""We repeat that it is unacceptable and inappropriate for businesses, individuals, and chambers of commerce from outside Syria to participate,"" it added.
A large UAE flag hung above the delegation stand where companies exhibited their goods and promotional material. The main sectors on display were concrete products and real estate.
""Our goal is to create a market in Syria and take part in big construction projects,"" said Mohamed Hamad Awad al-Karim, Business Development Manager at Dubai-based Al Shamsi, a supplier of ceramic products.
A representative of Arabtec declined to comment when approached by Reuters in Damascus and its head office did not respond to an emailed request.
The head of the UAE Federation of Chambers of Commerce who led the delegation to Damascus was unavailable for comment. In a statement, the fair's organizers said 26 UAE-based companies had stands at the fair.
A UAE trade delegation document with the logo of the Abu Dhabi Chamber of Commerce, obtained by Reuters, listed at least 42 delegates.
Washington has been lobbying Gulf states including the UAE to hold off restoring ties with Syria, sources told Reuters earlier this year.

""I am not happy to see a delegation of Emirati businessmen in Damascus to take part in a conference organized by the butcher regime of Bashar, whose hand is stained with the blood of the Syrian people,"" Emirati political scientist Abdulkhaleq Abdulla wrote on Twitter on Thursday.

920,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 31, 2019 09:31AM ET</span>",Factbox: Next rounds of Trump's tariffs on Chinese goods to hit consumers,"(Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump's next round of tariffs on Chinese imports is scheduled to take effect starting on Sunday, escalating the trade war between the world's two largest economies with a big hit to consumer goods.
Trump has targeted some $300 billion in annual goods imports from China for 15% tariffs in two parts, on Sept. 1 and Dec. 15. If fully imposed, virtually all Chinese imports - worth about $550 billion - would be subject to punitive U.S. tariffs imposed since July 2018.
Here is a look at U.S. tariffs and expected Chinese retaliation scheduled over the next several months.
SEPT. 1 TARIFFS
The U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency will begin collecting tariffs for Chinese goods at 12:01 a.m. EDT (0401 GMT) on Sunday. Guidance issued on Friday indicated that there will not be a grace period for cargoes that have left China before that time, unlike that granted for goods in transit when the United States imposed a tariff increase in May.
The Sept. 1 list covers about $125 billion worth of mostly consumer products, based on a Reuters analysis of 2018 U.S. Census Bureau data. The target list includes flat panel television sets, flash memory devices, power tools, cotton sweaters, bed linens, multifunction printers and many types of footwear.
The largest category of targeted products covers smart watches, smart speakers, Bluetooth headphones and other internet-connected devices that were spared from a prior round of tariffs, with Chinese imports estimated at $17.9 billion annually by the Consumer Technology Association.
OCT. 1 TARIFF INCREASE
The Trump administration is accepting public comments through Sept. 20 on a proposed Oct. 1 tariff rate increase to 30% from the 25% duty already in place on $250 billion worth of Chinese imports.
These products include $50 billion worth of largely non-consumer goods, including machinery, electronic components including semiconductors and printed circuit boards, and chemicals. But a later $200 billion list of goods included many consumer goods and building products, including furniture, vacuum cleaners, lighting fixtures, plumbing fixtures, handbags, luggage and vinyl flooring.
DEC. 15 TARIFFS
The second part of the 15% tariffs on Chinese goods not previously hit by U.S. duties is scheduled to go into effect on Dec. 15. This list represents the heart of the consumer technology sector, including $43 billion worth of cell phones imported from China in 2018, $37 billion worth of laptop and tablet computers and $12 billion worth of toys.
Trump delayed tariffs on these products, saying he wanted to avoid hurting Christmas season sales for Apple Inc (O:AAPL) and other companies and retailers.
The list covers about $156 billion worth of total 2018 imports from China, based on U.S. Census Bureau data, and includes a wide range of consumer goods, including plastic tableware, socks, light-emitting diode lamps, Christmas decorations and clothing.
CHINESE RETALIATION
After Trump in early August announced that he was moving ahead with tariffs on virtually all remaining Chinese imports, Beijing announced that it would impose additional 5% or 10% tariffs on a total of 5,078 product categories from the United States, representing worth about $75 billion annually.
The Chinese move, which also goes into effect in two steps on Sept. 1 and Dec. 15, targets U.S. crude oil for the first time with a 5% tariff. U.S. soybeans, already subject to a 25% Chinese tariff, will be hit with an extra 5% tariff on Sept. 1, while beef and pork from the United States will get an extra 10% tariff.
Beijing also will reinstitute a 25% tariff on U.S.-made vehicles and a 5% tariff on auto parts that it had suspended in December at a time when U.S.-China trade negotiations were gaining momentum.
China already has tariffs in place on about $110 billion worth of U.S. products, ranging from 5% to 25%, including soybeans, beef, pork seafood, vegetables, liquefied natural gas, whiskey and ethanol. Based on 2018 imports, there are only about $10 billion worth of U.S. imports untouched, with the largest category consisting of large commercial aircraft built by  Boeing Co  (N:BA).
U.S. TARIFF EXCLUSIONS
The Trump administration has excluded some Chinese-made household furniture including cribs and other baby safety products and bibles and other religious texts from the Sept. 1 and Dec. 15 rounds of tariffs.
Some of the products, including internet modems and routers, were removed because they had already been hit with 25% tariffs previously, while others were taken out for safety or religious reasons. Chinese-made rosaries and religious medals, however, will still be hit with 15% tariffs on Sept. 1."

The Social Democrats and Greens said on Friday they had agreed with the Center and Liberal Parties, which back them in parliament, to boost defense spending by 5 billion Swedish crowns ($520 million) a year from 2022 to 2025.
Sweden has been strengthening its armed forces and is concerned about increasing tensions with Russia in the Baltic region. Last year, Sweden said it would buy the Patriot air defense missile system from U.S. arms manufacturer  Raytheon Co  (N:RTN) in a 10 billion crown deal.
""The extra (for defense) for 2022 will be financed by an increase in taxes on the financial sector from 2022,"" Andersson told reporters.
""The banks make big profits each year and have been big winners from corporate tax cuts in recent years,"" she said.
She said the levy would bring in an extra 5 billion crowns per year. Andersson gave no details on how the tax would be constructed.
The Social Democrats have repeatedly raised the idea of a bank tax since taking power in 2014. In 2017 they put such plans on hold after widespread criticism of the way the tax was structured.
Finance Minister Magdalena Andersson repeated her intention for a bank tax in the run up to the election in 2018.
""We will come back with how this tax will be constituted, but it will be different from what has been discussed previously,"" Andersson said, adding that the new tax would cover all banks operating in Sweden regardless of where they have their headquarters.

Nordea (HE:NDAFI), the Nordic region's biggest banking group, recently shifted its headquarters to Finland from Stockholm.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Federal Communications Commission chairman Ajit Pai on Friday sought approval from his colleagues to order the go ahead for Nexstar Media Group Inc's acquisition of Tribune Media Co in a $6.4 billion tie-up, a spokeswoman for the agency said.
Last month, the U.S. Justice Department approved the deal, saying the companies must divest television stations in 13 markets to resolve antitrust concerns. Pai's order circulated Friday needs the consent of a majority of the five-member FCC.
Nexstar said in December it had agreed to buy Chicago-based Tribune for $4.1 billion in a deal valued at $6.4 billion including debt that would make it the largest regional U.S. television station operator. Tribune said earlier this month it looks forward to receiving ""regulatory approval"" for the deal soon.
Sinclair Broadcast Group Inc previously failed to win approval to buy Tribune. Tribune terminated its deal with Sinclair in August 2018, and filed a lawsuit arguing that Sinclair mishandled efforts to get the transaction approved by taking too long and being too aggressive in its dealings with regulators.
Based in Irving, Texas, Nexstar owns, operates and provides sales and other services to 174 television stations reaching nearly 39 percent of all U.S. television households. Nexstar said in March it was selling 19 television stations to Tegna Inc and E.W. Scripps Co for $1.3 billion to satisfy regulatory demands before it buys Tribune.

Based in Chicago, Tribune Media owns or operates 42 local television stations reaching approximately 50 million households. Tribune emerged from bankruptcy in late 2012 and completed a spinoff of its newspaper assets in 2014.

923,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 30, 2019 09:41PM ET</span>","Volkswagen overstated fuel economy on 98,000 U.S. vehicles, will repay consumers","By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p) must forfeit greenhouse gas emissions credits and is lowering the fuel economy ratings on 98,000 vehicles after the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said auto software overstated real-world performance.
Volkswagen said Friday it had agreed to a $96.5 million court settlement, with no fine, to reimburse affected customers.
The software was on roughly 1 million 2013-2017 model year Audi, Bentley, Porsche and Volkswagen vehicles, the agency said. It caused the transmission to shift gears in a manner that sometimes optimizes fuel economy and greenhouse gas emissions during the EPA-prescribed emissions test, but not under normal driving conditions, the agency said.
The vehicles getting lower ratings include versions of the Audi A8, Bentley Continental GT, Porsche Cayenne and VW Touareg. Not all of the five model years are covered by the settlement.
The EPA said Volkswagen has determined the software lowered the fuel economy rating on roughly 98,000 vehicles by about one mile per gallon.
The issue was discovered during an investigation by the EPA and California Air Resources Board into excess diesel emissions in hundreds of thousands of U.S. vehicles.
The German automaker admitted using illegal software to cheat U.S. pollution tests in 2015, triggering a global backlash against diesel vehicles that has so far cost it 30 billion euros ($33 billion) in fines, penalties and buyback costs. In May, it set aside an additional 5.5 billion euros in contingent liabilities.
The EPA said Volkswagen understated greenhouse gas emissions by about 220,000 metric tons and it will forfeit EPA credits and credits in the federal Corporate Average Fuel Economy program. The exact amount of credits will be subject to approval by EPA and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.
The issue reduced fuel economy by about 3.5% on impacted vehicles, VW said, adding customers will receive payments of $5.40 to $24.30 for each month the vehicle is owned or leased.
""Volkswagen is committed to providing customers with transparent fuel economy data for our vehicles, in line with U.S. labeling requirements,"" said VW spokesman Pietro Zollino.
The company added the settlement ""removes the uncertainty of protracted litigation and does not include any admission of liability or wrongdoing by Volkswagen."""
924,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 30, 2019 08:11PM ET</span>",Wall Street Weekahead: Retailers in spotlight as tariffs on consumer products kick in,"By Noel Randewich
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - U.S. retailers will be front and center on Wall Street next week as the United States imposes new tariffs on $300 billion worth of Chinese imports, including clothing, televisions and jewelry.
The upcoming tariffs on Chinese goods will hit consumers more directly than duties already levied against $250 billion worth of imports. Retailers are scrambling to cut costs and find ways to minimize the damage to their bottom lines, while Wall Street analysts try to identify those best positioned to weather the taxes.
The U.S. government is set impose tariffs on the newest list of products starting Sept. 1, with tariffs on about half of those goods delayed until Dec. 15 in a bid to soften their impact on holiday shoppers. President Donald Trump last week upped the tariffs to 15% from an originally planned 10%.
Trump's aggressive stance and often mixed signals in his trade war with China have taken a toll across Wall Street in recent weeks, especially on the shares of companies that rely heavily on the world's second-largest economy.
Wall Street rallied on Thursday after China's commerce ministry said both sides were discussing the next round of talks. Still, since Aug. 1, when Trump announced the September tariffs, the SPDR S&P Retail ETF (P:XRT) has slumped 6%, while the broader S&P 500 (SPX) has fallen 2%.
The Sept. 1 tariffs include consumer electronics worth $52 billion, including smart speakers, earbuds and televisions, according to the Consumer Technology Association, an industry group. 
Tariffs kicking in on Dec. 15 include consumer electronics worth $115 billion. That includes smartphones, laptops and videogame consoles, directly hitting tech companies, including Apple Inc (O:AAPL),  Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT) and HP Inc (N:HPQ).
Investors are looking for retailers most able to hold prices steady without hurting their margins, or increase prices without hurting demand for their products. They are also looking for companies that rely less on China for their wares.
""We're leaning in on quality across our Hardline Retail universe, favoring retailers with scale, pricing power in respective categories, less elastic products, and a greater focus on (professional) influenced sales and initiatives,""  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities analyst Zachary Fadem wrote in a report this week.
On that basis,  Home Depot  Inc (N:HD) and Lowe's Companies Inc (N:LOW) are best-positioned to weather the tariffs, relying on China for 10% or less of their cost of goods sold, Fadem wrote.
At the other extreme,  Best Buy  Co Inc (N:BBY) on Thursday gave a lower-than-expected full-year outlook, blaming tariffs and uncertainty about future consumer behavior, sending its stock down 8% and extending its loss to 17% in August.
Executives on Best Buy's analyst call said about 60% of the consumer electronics retailer's cost of goods sold comes from China, and that it was working on lowering that to 40% next year.
A basket of companies impacted by the trade war, created by  Barclays  (LON:BARC), has fallen around 8% this month, underperforming the S&P 500. Barclays’ basket includes consumer-facing companies that it estimates receive over 40% of their sales from products imported from China, including Apple,  Nike  Inc (N:NKE) and Whirlpool Corp (N:WHR).
Tariffs starting on Sept. 1 will affect $39 billion worth of footwear and clothing, with the December tariffs affecting another $12 billion worth of such products, according to the American Apparel & Footwear Association.
Heavyweight retailers, including Walmart Inc (N:WMT), Costco Wholesale Corp (O:COST),  Target  Corp (N:TGT) and Home Depot, can adjust their global supply chains and use their clout to force suppliers to accept smaller margins to offset the tariffs, giving them an advantage over smaller competitors.
Showing that investors are willing to buy retailers positioned to weather the trade war, Walmart has gained 7% since its quarterly report on Aug. 15, when it said it had raised the prices of some of its items due to tariffs but was not passing all the cost pressure it faces on to consumers.
Target has surged 26% since its Aug. 21 quarterly report, when it boosted its full-year profit outlook, even after accounting for potential additional tariffs.
A letter this week to Trump from over 200 U.S. footwear companies, including Adidas (DE:ADSGn) and  Foot Locker  Inc (N:FL), warned that the upcoming tariffs would exacerbate economic uncertainty and could drive up prices in other countries that produce footwear, given limited production capacities.

Abercrombie & Fitch Co (N:ANF) slumped 15% on Thursday after the apparel retailer cut its full-year sales forecast in anticipation of the new tariffs.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - The account of  Twitter Inc  (N:TWTR) Chief Executive Jack Dorsey was hacked on Friday afternoon, sending public tweets and retweets including racial slurs and curse words to 4 million followers before Twitter secured the account.
Twitter acknowledged the hack and said it was investigating. It later tweeted that Dorsey's account was secure and there was no indication that Twitter's systems had been compromised.
One of the tweets claimed Nazi leader Adolf Hitler was innocent, while others contained racist comments about black people and Jews. There was also a tweet suggesting there was a bomb at Twitter's headquarters.
The account posted a hashtag that was used during the apparent hacks of several YouTube stars last week. 
The hack underscored potential vulnerabilities in the social media platform, which is widely used by world leaders and politicians, including U.S. President Donald Trump. It comes at a time when social media companies are facing scrutiny over management of their networks, privacy issues and security of user data.
The offensive tweets and retweets were deleted less than an hour after the incident. Some Twitter accounts named in the compromised tweets and retweets appeared suspended on Friday.
Screenshots of the tweets appeared to show they were sent through Cloudhopper, a mobile text messaging service that Twitter acquired in 2010. Twitter did not immediately respond when asked to confirm if the hack took place via Cloudhopper. 
Security researcher Brian Krebs said it appeared that Dorsey was the victim of a SIM swapping attack, when a mobile provider is tricked or otherwise convinced to transfer a victim's phone number to a SIM card controlled by someone else.
The Friday incident was not the first time that Dorsey's Twitter account has been hacked: his account was compromised in 2016 by a group that also hacked the Twitter accounts of Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) CEO Sundar Pichai and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) CEO Mark Zuckerberg. 

Twitter shares were down less than 1% in after-hours trade following the hack.

A person familiar with the fundraising said the Friday's filing was an expansion of the offering from earlier this month, in which the company said it had raised $325 million, and is intended to ""bolster the company's balance sheet as it continues to grow worldwide.""
The company sold convertible debt in a bridge financing which was less time consuming than an equity-financing round, the person familiar with the matter told Reuters. 
Juul, in which  Altria Group  Inc (N:MO) has a 35% ownership stake, has been launching its products in international markets like South Korea, Indonesia, and Philippines while facing intense scrutiny from regulators in the U.S. over its e-cigarettes which are widely popular among teenagers. 

On Thursday, Reuters reported that the Federal Trade Commission was investigating the marketing practices of the San Francisco-based company, citing a source. (https://reut.rs/2zzDTZr)

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Federal Aviation Administration said on Friday a blue-ribbon panel of experts around the world will need a few more weeks to finish its review into the Boeing 737 MAX certification.
The team, which is reviewing the approval of the now grounded jet involved in two fatal crashes since October, is taking additional time to finish documenting its work and the FAA said it expects its recommendations in the coming weeks.
 Boeing Co  (N:BA) has said it hopes to receive regulatory approval for updated flight control software at the center of both crashes in October, but it could take a month or two for airlines to train pilots on the new software and prepare the jets for commercial flight after sitting idle for months.
The Joint Authorities Technical Review is chaired by former National Transportation Safety Board Chairman Christopher Hart, and the FAA said its focus on the certification of the aircraft ""is separate from the ongoing efforts to safely return the aircraft to flight.""
In September the NTSB plans to outline airplane design certification procedures, the head of the agency, Robert Sumwalt, told Congress in July.
Sumwalt said in March that the agency was ""examining the U.S. design certification process to ensure any deficiencies are captured and addressed” after two fatal Boeing 737 MAX crashes.
United Airlines said on Friday it was extending the cancellation of Boeing 737 MAX flights by another month until Dec. 19.
Since the twin disasters, a host of government agencies and outside experts have been investigating how the FAA certifies new aircraft and its longstanding practice of delegating certification tasks to airplane manufacturers - including federal prosecutors, the Department of Transportation’s inspector general, Congress and several blue-ribbon panels.
Deputy FAA Administrator Dan Elwell told Congress in March the agency would have to spend $1.8 billion and hire 10,000 new employees to handle all aircraft certification internally.
Michael Perrone, who heads the Professional Aviation Safety Specialists union, said at a House hearing in July that external entities designated by the FAA ""are now performing more than 90 percent of FAA’s certification activities despite serious concerns that oversight is lacking.""

He added this “creates a concerning dynamic whereby designees who are paid by the aircraft manufacturers, airlines, or repair stations are simultaneously overseeing for the FAA.""

The S&P 500 gained all of 0.06%. The Dow Jones industrials rallied to a 0.16% gain and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.13%.
In a month where the Dow saw 16 days where changes were 100 points or more, traders probably decided they needed the break for the Labor Day weekend to recharge. U.S. markets will be closed on Monday.
But the U.S.-China trade battles that dominated headlines this month will be back. The United States plans to impose tariffs on a wide variety of goods from China starting Sunday. There's a second round, mostly on consumer products, due in December. The two sides mostly toned down the rhetoric this week, allowing stocks to come back from losses the week before. 
The S&P 500 finished the week up 2.8%, while the Dow rose 3%. The Nasdaq was up 2.7%.
The S&P 500 finished August with a 1.8% loss. The Dow fell 1.72% and the Nasdaq dropped 2.6%.
For the year, the S&P 500 is up 16.7%, while the Dow has risen 13.2%. The Nasdaq is up 20%.
The splashiest move of any stock came from Ulta Beauty (NASDAQ:ULTA), which had been growing rapidly for the last few years. But Thursday, it cut its profit forecast for the full year and warned that sales would slow. CEO Mary Dillon said the outlook reflects ""the headwinds we are currently seeing in the U.S. cosmetics market.""
Shares were off 29%, by far the worst performer among stocks in both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq 100 index. The Nasdaq 100 was down 0.15%.
Ulta was only a small reason for the decline. Decliners included Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST), Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX), Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL).
Leading the Dow were pharmacy giant Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA); UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) after multiple days of losses and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC). Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) was the laggard, down 1%.
The quiet day came as oil prices moved lower. Gold futures were $7.50 lower to $1,529.40 an ounce, but palladium, a key element used to control automobile emissions, jumped a whopping $57.70 an ounce in the futures market to $1,539.50, making it once again the world's priciest metal.
Interest rates moved lower with the 10-Year yield falling to 1.505% from Thursday's 1.516%. The spread between the 10-year yield and two-year yield narrowed to negative 0.77 basis points, continuing the yield inversion that has many concerned a recession may be in the offing. The 2-Year yield was 1.51%.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street ended the week with a lackluster session on Friday as investors were cautious ahead of a holiday weekend in which a fresh round of U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports were due to be levied.
While the S&P 500 (SPX) registered its biggest weekly gain since June, August had its biggest monthly decline since May. Investors had fled risky assets in August due to escalations in the U.S.-China trade war and the inversion of a key part of the U.S. yield curve which is often a recessionary signal.
U.S. financial markets were due to stay closed on Monday for the Labor Day holiday and a new round of U.S. tariffs on some Chinese goods were expected to come into effect on Sunday. Trading volume was light as and the S&P swapping between negative and positive territory in the afternoon to end the day with little progress. 
""People are becoming more defensive going into the weekend because we have three days where we can't react to news and it's three days that have a lot of uncertainty associated with them because of the tariffs,"" said Robert Phipps, a director at Per Stirling Capital Management in Austin, Texas. 
""Right now everything is evolving around the trade complex and probably will for the remainder of this year,"" he said.
The United States and China had given hopeful signs on trade on Thursday as they discussed the next round of in-person negotiations in September.
But Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives for  Charles Schwab  (NYSE:SCHW) in Austin, urged caution saying: ""Frankly, markets have been overly optimistic about trade."" 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) rose 41.03 points, or 0.16%, to 26,403.28, the S&P 500 (SPX) gained 1.88 points, or 0.06%, to 2,926.46 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) dropped 10.51 points, or 0.13%, to 7,962.88.
Since bonds have recently outperformed stocks, investors may have taken early action to rebalance their portfolios for the end of the month due to the long weekend, according to Vinay Pande, head of trading strategies at UBS Global Wealth Management in New York.
U.S. consumer spending increased solidly in July as households bought a range of goods and services. While this could allay financial market fears of a recession, a survey from the University of Michigan, also out Friday, showed its consumer sentiment index in August dropping by the most since December 2012, amid nerves over the U.S.-China trade war.
""The news today has been mixed. There was positive news about consumption data and negative news on consumer confidence,"" said Pande. 
The Consumer Discretionary sector (SPLRCD) was the S&P's biggest drag as Ulta Beauty Inc (O:ULTA), which had been the S&P's top performing stock in Wall Street's decade-old bull market, tumbled 29.6% after the cosmetics company cut its full-year profit forecast. 
One of the biggest percentage gainers on the benchmark index was  Campbell Soup  Co (N:CPB), which jumped 3.9% after its quarterly profit beat estimates.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.38-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.05-to-1 ratio favored advancers.
The S&P 500 posted 36 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 37 new highs and 62 new lows.

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 5.77 billion shares, compared with the 7.13 billion average for the last 20 trading days.

Ulta cut its guidance on full-year earnings per share to a range of $11.86 to $12.06, from a prior range of $12.83 to $13.03, sending its shares tumbling 30%. The stock turned negative for the year so far, down about 2.5%. 
The company reported earnings per share of $2.72 on revenue of $1.67 billion. Analysts polled by Investing.com anticipated earnings per share of $2.80 on revenue of $1.68 billion. 
It wasn’t so long ago that Ulta) could do no wrong, bucking the gloomy backdrop for cosmetics, but its profit cut and earnings miss during the second quarter was “thesis changing,” said   Morgan Stanley   (NYSE:MS), as it joined in on the slew of rate cuts on the stock.
Morgan downgraded Ulta to equal-weight from over-weight and slashed price target to $275 from $395. Piper Jaffray (NYSE:PJC) downgraded the shares to neutral from a buy-equivalent and cut its price target to $250 per share from $360. 
But among the wave of downgrades, there are some, however, who are not ready to call time on the stock just yet, Gina Sanchez, CEO of Chantico Global said in a CNBC interview on Thursday. 
She cautioned, however, that Ulta’s valuation had become “too lofty.”
Sanchez was not alone in her backing the stock as Loop Capital insisted the long-term outlook for the company was “fairly bullish” given the continued weakness in the mall-based department store channel and the retailer's “top-notch” loyalty program.
Ulta has a consensus price target of $370, according to estimates compiled by Investing.com."

The Miami-based National Hurricane Center issued a hurricane watch for the northwestern Bahamas, and said Dorian was likely to remain an extremely dangerous hurricane as it approaches Florida through the weekend.
Here are some stocks to keep an eye on as Hurricane Dorian gathers strength:
CRUISE LINES
Climate risk consulting company Four Twenty Seven identified Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings (N:NCLH),  Royal Caribbean  Cruises (N:RCL) and Carnival Corp (N:CCL) as having high relative exposure to the Florida region that could be affected by Dorian. Their shares were up between 0.1% and 0.9% on Friday.
Four Twenty Seven also flagged health insurer Humana (N:HUM) and NextEra Energy (N:NEE), the parent company of Florida Power & Light Co, due to their exposure to the region. Their shares were up 1.4% and down 0.8%, respectively.
FREIGHT 
Shares in freight companies may gain after a destructive hurricane on bets they will see rising demand from businesses shipping in materials for rebuilding efforts. U.S. freight companies include  USA Truck  Inc (O:USAK), last up 4%,  XPO Logistics  Inc (N:XPO), last up 2%,  Old Dominion Freight Line Inc  (O:ODFL), up 0.6%, JB Hunt Transport Services (O:JBHT), up 1%.
INSURANCE
Regional property insurers with exposure to Florida include United Insurance Holdings (O:UIHC),  HCI  Group Inc (N:HCI), Heritage Insurance Holdings (N:HRTG), Fednat Holding Co (O:FNHC) and  Universal Insurance Holdings Inc  (N:UVE). Fednat was down 2% on Friday and United Insurance was down 2%. 
Populations have risen along the Atlantic coast every year since 2000, despite increasing hurricane risks, according to AIR, a catastrophic risk management company. The total insured value of residential and commercial property in Florida's coastal counties reached $3.6 trillion last year, up from $3.2 trillion in 2015.
BUILDING SUPPLIES 
Hurricanes have had mixed effects on shares of building products. In September 2018, as Hurricane Florence approached North Carolina, shares of roofing and insulation companies rose while shares of cement companies fell. On Friday, shares of building supply companies, including  Owens Corning  (N:OC),  Summit Materials Inc  (N:SUM),  Martin Marietta Materials Inc  (N:MLM) and Vulcan Materials Co (N:VMC), were little changed overall. One exception was  Beacon Roofing  Supply Inc (O:BECN), whose shares rose 2.8%.
HOME IMPROVEMENT
Shares of Lowe's Companies Inc (N:LOW) were down 0.1% and  Home Depot  Inc (N:HD) was up 0.2% on Friday. Their stocks have benefited in the wake of previous hurricanes as homeowners made purchases to repair damage.
HOTELS
Shares of hotel operators have gained following previous hurricanes as demand from people displaced by hurricanes outweighed the hit from declines in tourism. 
 Hyatt Hotels Corp  (N:H), Marriott International Inc (O:MAR),  Hilton Worldwide  Holdings Inc (N:HLT) and  Choice Hotels International Inc  (N:CHH) were little changed on Friday, up as much as 0.3% and down as much as 0.1%.

934,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 30, 2019 04:17PM ET</span>","Airbus pulls out of Canada fighter jet race, boosts Lockheed Martin's chances","By David Ljunggren
OTTAWA (Reuters) - Airbus SE (PA:AIR) on Friday pulled out of a multibillion-dollar competition to supply Canada with 88 new fighter jets, a decision that boosts the chances of rival  Lockheed Martin  Corp (N:LMT).
The defense arm of Airbus, which indicated last month it might withdraw, cited onerous security requirements and a late decision by Ottawa to loosen the rules for how much bidders would have to invest in Canada.
Airbus and other contenders had already complained the government appeared to be tilting the race in favor of Lockheed Martin's F-35 plane, which the Royal Canadian Air Force wants. Canada is part of the consortium that developed the plane.
Canada launched the long-delayed competition last month and said it was confident no favoritism had been shown. Ottawa says the contract is worth between C$15 billion ($11.30 billion) and C$19 billion.
Canada's official opposition Conservative Party, which is seeking to defeat Liberal Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in an October election, accused the government of gross mismanagement.
Reuters revealed in July that Airbus and  Boeing Co  (N:BA) had written to Ottawa to say they might pull out.
The firms are unhappy that in late May, the government dropped a demand that bidders must guarantee to give Canadian businesses 100% of the value of the deal in economic benefits. 
Such legally watertight commitments, which Boeing, Airbus and Sweden's Saab AB (ST:SAABb) had already agreed to, contradict rules of the F-35 consortium. Ottawa's move allowed Lockheed Martin to stay in the competition.
""One of the strongest points of our bid was the fact we were willing to make binding commitments,"" said an Airbus source, who requested anonymity given the sensitivity of the situation.
""Once this was loosened up to a point where these commitments were no longer valued in the same way"", the firm decided ""that's just too much"", added the source, who also cited security challenges.
European jets must show they can meet stringent standards required by the United States, which with Canada operates the North American Aerospace Defense Command.
""NORAD security requirements continue to place too significant of a cost on platforms whose manufacture and repair chains sit outside the United States (and) Canada,"" Airbus said in a statement.
Canadian Procurement Minister Carla Qualtrough said she respected the Airbus decision, adding Ottawa was determined there should be a level playing field.
""This included adapting the economic benefits approach to ensure the highest level of participation among suppliers,"" she said in emailed comments. 
Canada has been trying unsuccessfully for almost a decade to purchase replacements for its aging F-18 fighters. The former Conservative administration said in 2010 it would buy 65 F-35 jets but later scrapped the decision, triggering years of delays and reviews.
Trudeau's Liberals took power in 2015 vowing not to buy the F-35 on the grounds that it was too costly, but have since softened their line.
""Justin Trudeau has spent the past four years delaying and dithering on new fighter jets for Canada only to completely mismanage the competition process,"" said Conservative defense spokesman James Bezan. 

Lockheed Martin declined to comment while Boeing and Saab did not respond to requests for comment.

935,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 30, 2019 04:08PM ET</span>",Hurricane Dorian strengthens as Florida prepares for impact,"By Zachary Fagenson
MIAMI (Reuters) - Residents of Florida on Friday were boarding up windows and stocking up on food, water and gas as Hurricane Dorian gained strength and slowly churned toward the U.S. mainland.
The storm has alarmed forecasters who worry parts of Florida will be walloped by strong winds, a storm surge and heavy rain for an extended period when it makes landfall early next week.
The Miami-based National Hurricane Center said Dorian was expected to continue strengthening and remain an ""extremely dangerous major hurricane"" as it moves northwest near the Bahamas and approaches the Florida peninsula.
Florida Governor Ron DeSantis urged residents to have at least a week's worth of food, water and medicine, saying at a news conference in Tallahassee that they should be prepared for a ""multiday event."" Florida is under a declaration of emergency.
""They’re buying everything, everything and anything that applies to a hurricane, flashlights, batteries, generators,” said Amber Hunter, 30, assistant manager at the ACE Handiman hardware store in Cape Canaveral on Florida's east coast.
Hunter said generators were the most popular item.
NHC Director Ken Graham urged Florida residents to have their preparations wrapped up on Sunday before tropical storm-force winds hit the coast that night.
Employees at Conchy Joe's Seafood in Jensen Beach on Florida's east coast were boarding up windows and stripping bare the restaurant's waterfront tiki bar on Friday before heading to their homes to make similar preparations.
""I’m planning on boarding up my house this evening,"" said Jamison Weeks, the restaurant's 38-year-old general manager. ""The mood is a little tense, everybody’s a little nervous and just trying to prepare as best as possible.""
Dorian is expected to bring a life-threatening storm surge that raises water levels by as much as 10 to 15 feet (3 to 4.5 meters) above normal levels in parts of the northwestern Bahamas, the NHC said in an advisory at 2 p.m. EDT (1800 GMT). Near the coast, the surge will be accompanied by large and destructive waves.
""Almost everyone has left, or is leaving today,” said Pauline Powell, 26, who was on a family vacation at the Island Seas Resort in Grand Bahama when the storm started barreling toward the area's pristine beaches. 
The Bahamas Ministry of Tourism and Aviation said hotels and resorts throughout that part of the island nation have activated hurricane response programs. The Grand Bahama International Airport in Freeport will close Friday night and will not open until Sept. 3, the ministry said in a statement.
'REALLY WORRIED'
Dorian began on Friday over the Atlantic as a Category 2 hurricane on the five-step Saffir-Simpson Wind Scale but strengthened to a Category 3 later in the day. It had maximum sustained winds of 115 miles per hour (185 km per hour), according to the latest NHC advisory.
If, as expected, Dorian reaches Category 4 strength over the weekend, its winds will blow at more than 130 mph (210 kph). It is currently moving at a pace of 10 miles per hour (16 km/h), giving it more time to intensify before making landfall.
Forecasters predicted it will be over the northwestern Bahamas on Sunday and near the Florida peninsula late on Monday. It is projected to make landfall in South Florida and then head up through the central part of the state.
Rainfall of about 6 to 12 inches (15 to 30 cm), with up to 18 inches (46 cm) in some areas of the northwestern Bahamas and Florida, is expected.
""What’s concerning is it's slowed down. We’re looking at a multiple-day event. We were hoping it would just barrel through and leave,"" said Ben Malik, the mayor of Cocoa Beach, about 85 miles (136 km) north of Port St. Lucie.
""I’m really worried about the amount of rain we’ll be getting.""
Some gas stations in Florida have run dry and others have long lines of cars, DeSantis said, adding that the state had eased regulations to allow higher-capacity trucks to transport fuel and to make it easier to bring in fuel from other states.
Gasoline prices at the pump are not expected to spike because of the storm, said Patrick DeHaan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy.com.
""There are no refiners in Florida, there’s only a pipeline, and I can’t imagine that would be affected significantly. Fuel is flowing, and that’s the most important factor,” DeHaan said.
 Chevron  Corp (N:CVX), the second-largest U.S.-based oil and natural gas producer, said it has begun evacuating non-essential personnel from two oil platforms in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and has begun supplying ""as much fuel as possible in advance of the storm"" to its retail fuel outlets in the U.S. Southeast.
Two thousand National Guard troops will have been mobilized for the hurricane by the end of Friday, with another 2,000 joining them on Saturday, Florida National Guard Major General James Eifert said. 
Florida officials also were making sure all nursing homes and assisted living facilities had generators, and were checking with more than 100 facilities where information about generators was uncertain.
Only one in five Florida nursing homes plans to rely on deliveries of temporary generators to keep their air conditioners running if Dorian knocks out power, a state agency said on Friday, short of the standard set by a law passed after a dozen people died in a sweltering nursing home after 2017's Hurricane Irma.
Officials from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which was harshly criticized in 2005 for its slow response to Hurricane Katrina and its aftermath, briefed Congress on Friday on the steps they are taking to prepare for Dorian.
FEMA has begun moving personnel and equipment into Georgia, including trucks and line crews who would help get electricity back up and running if there is a serious service interruption in Florida, according to a Democratic aide in the U.S. House of Representatives familiar with the briefings.
Georgia Governor Brian Kemp has declared a state of emergency in 12 counties in the state.
President Donald Trump on Thursday canceled a planned weekend trip to Poland so he can make sure resources are properly directed for the storm.

Dorian could churn across dozens of launchpads owned by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the Air Force and companies such as Elon Musk's SpaceX and Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks were in the red on Friday afternoon as investors were wary after mixed data and ahead of a holiday weekend in which a fresh round of U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports were due to kick in.
While Wall Street was on course to register a weekly gain, August was expected to show its biggest monthly decline since May after escalations in U.S.-China trade tensions and the inversion of a key part of the U.S. yield curve which is often a recessionary signal.
Wall Street markets will be closed on Monday for the U.S. Labor Day holiday. Since bonds have recently outperformed stocks, investors may have taken early action to rebalance their portfolios for the end of the month due to the long weekend, according to Vinay Pande, head of trading strategies at UBS Global Wealth Management in New York.
""Trying to make a very large move in the last day of the month when Labor day is following is not the best idea,"" said Pande. ""Most of the rebalancing that was expected ... has likely been accomplished in the days leading up to the long weekend.""
U.S. consumer spending increased solidly in July as households bought a range of goods and services. While this could allay financial market fears of a recession, a survey from the University of Michigan, also out Friday, showed its consumer sentiment index in August dropping by the most since December 2012, amid nerves over the U.S.-China trade war.
""The news today has been mixed. There was positive news about consumption data and negative news on consumer confidence,"" said Pande.
At 2:57 p.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) fell 13.47 points, or 0.05%, to 26,348.78, the S&P 500 (SPX) lost 3.53 points, or 0.12%, to 2,921.05 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) dropped 32.82 points, or 0.41%, to 7,940.58.
The United States and China had given hopeful signs on trade on Thursday as they discussed the next round of in-person negotiations in September ahead of a looming deadline for additional U.S. tariffs.
But Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives for  Charles Schwab  (NYSE:SCHW) in Austin, urged caution.
""Frankly, markets have been overly optimistic about trade,"" he said. ""I would caution people to be a little careful because optimism won't last if it doesn't ultimately materialize into something substantive like an agreement, which I just have a hard time seeing it happen.""
A new round of U.S. tariffs on some Chinese goods were expected to come into effect on Sunday and the technology sector (SPLRCT) was the biggest weight on the S&P with a 0.4% loss.
Ulta Beauty Inc (O:ULTA), which had been the S&P's top performing stock in Wall St's decade-old bull market, tumbled 29% after the cosmetics company cut its full-year profit forecast.
The biggest percentage gainer on the benchmark index was  Campbell Soup  Co (N:CPB), which jumped 5% after its quarterly profit beat estimates.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.16-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.16-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

937,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 30, 2019 03:43PM ET</span>",How Popeyes Ran Out of Chicken for Its Famous Sandwiches,"(Bloomberg) -- A social media frenzy means Popeyes quickly ran out of its new, instantly iconic chicken sandwiches. Meanwhile, the U.S. poultry market is bursting with oversupply.
U.S. chicken companies are forecast to process a record 43.3 billion pounds of the meat in 2019, government data show. So why isn’t that enough to meet demand for the new sandwich? It comes down to needing a specific product at a specific time.
When restaurant chains contract with suppliers, they often have tight product specifications and buy a set volume, said Tom Elam, a consultant for the poultry industry. Specifications can include seasonings, coatings, and the size and thickness of the cut with very little variation, he said. In other words, there’s a glut of meat, but not all of it’s ready for Twitter sandwich fame.
How Popeye’s Chicken Sandwich Harnessed Social Media (Podcast)
“They can’t just turn this stuff on and off,” Elam said. Suppliers often can’t “make more of that particular product spec in a short amount of time,” he said.
So Popeyes has to replenish its stockpile of custom-made chicken for its sandwich, and the restaurant chain is currently working with suppliers to build up its inventory, spokeswoman Brooke Scher Mogan said by email. There’s currently no set date for the relaunch. Popeyes on Tuesday announced on its Twitter page that the sandwich had sold out less than a month after it was first offered nationally.
It’s striking that the chicken sandwich is facing shortages at a time when many restaurants are going all in on plant-based proteins.
Popeyes’ sister companies, Burger King and Tim Hortons, all owned by Restaurant Brands International Inc., recently started serving wildly popular plant-based offerings, but neither appear to be facing tight supplies.
“It’s a hard task to demand plan for products, and it becomes exponentially harder when you’re talking about a new menu item,” said David Maloni, executive vice president of analytics at commodity researcher ArrowStream. “It’s not uncommon to be off.”"

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury yields edged higher on Friday on hopes the United States and China will take steps to de-escalate their trade war, though trading volumes were muted before a U.S. holiday.
The two countries gave signs on Thursday that they will resume trade talks as the two economic superpowers discussed the next round of in-person negotiations in September. A new round of U.S. tariffs on some Chinese goods is scheduled to take effect on Sunday.
Demand for Treasuries for month-end extension was seen capping bond weakness on Friday, though trading volumes were light ahead of Monday’s U.S. Labor Day holiday, when the bond market will be closed.
“It’s a decent-size extension, but volumes are very, very light as to be expected ahead of the holiday,” said Justin Lederer, an interest rate strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald in New York.
Investors are likely to remain nervous about the impact of worsening U.S.-China trade relations as economic growth weakens globally, which should maintain demand for safe-haven debt.
""It definitely feels like there are buyers of safe havens around the globe,"" Lederer said.
The yield curve between 2-year and 10-year notes on Wednesday was the most inverted since 2007, at minus 6.50 basis points, a signal that a recession is likely in one to two years. The curve was last minus 0.30 basis point.
Thirty-year bond yields (US30YT=RR) fell to record lows of 1.905% on Wednesday as investors sought safe-haven debt, but rose back to 1.992% on Friday.
Data on Friday showed that U.S. consumer spending increased solidly in July as households bought a range of goods and services, though the pace of growth in consumption is unlikely to be sustained amid tepid income gains.
The University of Michigan's sentiment index, meanwhile, posted its largest drop since December 2012 in August."

ZURICH (Reuters) - Lender  Julius Baer  (S:BAER) has decided to keep its Italian subsidiary Kairos after completing a strategic review and as the asset and wealth manager's performance improves, Switzerland's third-largest listed bank said on Friday.
Julius Baer had put Kairos under strategic review after it suffered outflows on the heels of poor fund performance in 2018. It said in July it was considering options including divesting the unit, forming a partnership or keeping it and trying to improve profitability.
""Our review has clearly shown that Julius Baer is the best owner for Kairos, which offers significant potential for us to build out our position in the attractive Italian wealth management market,"" European head Yves Robert-Charrue said in a statement.
""After a difficult 2018, the performance of Kairos funds in the first half of 2019 has markedly improved.""
Italy's  Mediobanca  (MI:MDBI) was considering acquiring Kairos.
Baer now intends to more closely align Kairos' wealth management business serving clients based in Italy with its own, including better access to the its products and services, the bank said.
""Over the coming months, these conclusions will be developed into a detailed implementation plan to realize the further growth potential of Kairos and additional revenue synergies,"" it said.
Kairos' assets under management had more than doubled to over 9 billion euros ($10.03 billion) since the start of the strategic partnership in June 2013, it noted."

(Reuters) - U.S. stocks lost steam in afternoon trading on Friday as investors moved to the sidelines ahead of a long Labor day weekend but the three major indexes were on course to wrap up the week with their biggest gains since June.
Despite the gains, Wall Street was set for its worst month since May after escalations in U.S.-China trade tensions and fears of a risk of recessions, underscored by the inversion of a key part of the U.S. yield curve, triggered bouts of selloff in August.

943,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 30, 2019 01:56PM ET</span>",Critics accuse U.S. CEOs of contradicting pledge to work for more than shareholders,"By Ross Kerber
BOSTON (Reuters) - A pledge by top CEOs to work for more than shareholders drew criticism on Friday from investor activists, who accused the corporate leaders of contradicting their inclusive message by lobbying against social and environmental reform efforts.
The activists, members of a New York interfaith group, faulted the CEO trade group known as the Business Roundtable for taking a public stand that corporations should seek to promote the interests of a wide range of stakeholders, including workers and communities, while pressing for such rule changes as making it harder to file proxy resolutions.
The disconnect between the positions is ""kind of glaring,"" said Josh Zinner, CEO of the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility. ""It’s important to point out the inconsistency here.""
The Interfaith Center says it is a coalition of more than 300 institutions with more than $500 billion in total investments. Its participants have successfully used resolutions to get companies to disclose more about issues like climate change risks and human rights concerns.
In a letter sent late on Thursday, Zinner praised the Roundtable's interests beyond the bottom line but asked the group to dial back efforts such as trying to raise the thresholds needed to file and resubmit resolutions.
A Roundtable representative did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The Roundtable's Aug. 19 ""Statement on the Purpose of a Corporation"" was signed by the heads of 181 U.S. companies, including those of Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN.O),  American Airlines Group  Inc (NASDAQ:AAL.O) and JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM.N).
However symbolic, the Roundtable statement broke with the orthodoxy that corporations should only serve shareholders, though some investors and business people worry the new approach could diminish competitiveness.
The Council of Institutional Investors, representing big public pension funds and asset managers, said the all-stakeholder focus also could make CEOs less accountable.
""Accountability to everyone means accountability to no one,"" the group said."

Tesla sees China as one of its most important, growing markets, and the exemption from a 10% purchase tax could reduce the cost of buying a Tesla by up to 99,000 yuan ($13,957.82), according to a post on Tesla's social media WeChat account. 
Sixteen variants - all the Tesla models sold in the country - are listed on a document issued by MIIT on its website, including Model S, X and 3.
No reason was given for the decision to exclude the cars from the tax, but it comes as Tesla is expanding in China, with a new factory and visits by Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk.
Tesla's plant in Shanghai will be its first overseas factory, and the company is gearing up for a major Chinese sales push by promoting racing events, showroom parties with DJs and a line of Chinese Tesla stickers for chat apps. 
Musk has met with senior leaders, including China's Vice President Wang Qishan, and the transportation minister. 
He also has publicly praised China in the midst of tensions with the United States, thanking the Shanghai and national governments for support, calling national leaders ""very thoughtful"" and describing China's ""amazing"" progress in sustainable energy, transport and space.
""This year they did more orbital launches than the USA for the first time,"" Musk, who also is the chief executive of rocket maker SpaceX, tweeted in December. (https:// ""It is pretty clear Tesla is committed to China, with the investment in the Shanghai Gigafactory. Those relationships probably helped Tesla lobby for a successful exemption from the tax,"" Roth Capital analyst Craig Irwin said. ""Now we need to closely watch the build out of the Shanghai Gigafactory and Model 3 volume ramp in China,"" Irwin added. Tesla did not respond to a Reuters request for comment. While the company does not disclose sales by country, consultancy firm LMC Automotive estimates sales of 23,678 Tesla vehicles in China in the first seven months this year, nearly double the number of cars it sold a year earlier. Shares of the company were up 1.5% at $225.01 in early afternoon trading.

MUNICH (Reuters) - Activist investors calling for strategic change at Scout24 (DE:G24n) have won a vote to place a representative on the German classifieds group's non-executive supervisory board, ramping up pressure on management.
Christoph Brand, an executive at Swiss publisher Tamedia (S:TAMN), won a board seat at the group's annual shareholder meeting in Munich, beating out rival candidate Mathias Hedlund, who had been proposed by Scout24's management.
Brand had been nominated by London-based Pelham Capital, which has built a 7.7% position in the group.
A takeover bid for the classifieds group by Hellman & Friedman and Blackstone (NYSE:BX) failed earlier this year, despite management's recommendation that shareholders accept the offer.
That bid attracted the attention of activists including Pelham and Elliott, which has disclosed a stake of more than 7%, and which have called on the company to boost shareholder returns.
Scout24 said this month it would explore a sale or spin-off of its autos platform AutoScout24 and borrow more to buy back shares, in a concession to Elliott's demand to carve out and sell AutoScout24.
The company runs Germany's leading property portal ImmobilienScout24 and its autos operation, which competes with eBay's (O:EBAY) mobile.de, is present in Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium and Austria."

CHICAGO (Reuters) - United Airlines Holdings (O:UAL) said on Friday it is extending the cancellation of Boeing 737 MAX flights by another month until Dec. 19 as the jets remain grounded worldwide following two fatal crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia in the past year.
 Boeing Co  (N:BA) has said it hopes to receive regulatory approval for updated flight control software at the center of both crashes in October, but it could take a month or two for airlines to train pilots on the new software and prepare the jets for commercial flight after sitting idle for months.
As the grounding that began in mid-March has dragged on, airlines that added the fuel-efficient, single-aisle MAX to their fleets in the past two years have had to cancel thousands of monthly flights, eating into their profits. 
Chicago-based United had previously pulled its 14 737 MAX jets from its flight schedule through early November. Without the MAX, the carrier said it expects to cancel about 2,800 flights in November and 1,700 through Dec. 19.
Among other U.S. airlines that operate the MAX, Southwest Airlines Co (N:LUV) has canceled flights into early January due to the grounding, while  American Airlines Group  (O:AAL) has canceled through early November, saying it believes it can fly the jets by the holidays.

While the three airlines' MAX jets accounted for only a fraction of their entire fleet at the time of the grounding, the impact on their schedules has intensified as deliveries of dozens of new orders remain frozen until the planes are approved to fly again.

Trump appeared to be referring to a Bloomberg News story that reported GM's hourly workforce of 46,000 U.S. workers has fallen behind that of  Fiat  Chrysler (MI:FCHA) as the smallest of the Detroit Three automakers. Over the past four decades, GM has dramatically cut the size of its overall U.S. workforce, which numbered nearly 620,000 in 1979.
GM did not directly comment on Trump's tweet.
""GM’s China operations are not a threat to U.S. jobs,"" the company said in a fact sheet, noting that its joint ventures have sent $16 billion in equity income to GM since 2010 and that it has invested $23 billion in U.S. operations since 2009.
GM's U.S. hourly workforce has fallen by about 4,000 jobs since the end of 2018 to about where it was a decade ago.
Trump's ire with GM comes as contract talks with the United Auto Workers union with the Detroit Three automakers intensify ahead of a Sept. 14 deadline. Trump has previously attacked GM for building vehicles in Mexico and for ending production at plants in Michigan, Ohio and Maryland and threatened to cut GM subsidies in retaliation.
GM's decision to close four plants in the United States is a central issue in the contract talks.
Trump has made boosting auto jobs a key priority and has often attacked automakers on Twitter for not doing enough to boost U.S. employment. His 2020 re-election bid will hinge on holding key industrial battleground states like Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Michigan that narrowly voted for him in 2016.
China is the world’s largest auto market, and government policy favors automakers assembling vehicles there, and not importing them from overseas.
In response to Trump’s latest tariffs, China said last week it will reinstitute 25% tariffs on U.S.-made vehicles. The U.S. is imposing 15% tariffs on more than $125 billion in Chinese goods starting Sunday.
GM sold 3.6 million vehicles in China last year accounting for 43% of its worldwide sales. GM booked $2 billion in equity income from its China operations last year.
GM imports a small number of vehicles from China. In June, the Trump administration rejected a request from GM to exempt its Chinese-made Buick Envision from a 25% U.S. tariff on sport utility vehicle models.

The midsize SUV has become a target for U.S. critics of Chinese-made goods, including leaders of the UAW members in key political swing states such as Michigan and Ohio.

(Reuters) -  Campbell Soup  Co (N:CPB) on Friday reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter profit and margins as the food company sold more soups and snacks, tightened up its supply chain and cut costs, sending shares up more than 8%.
To better focus on its mainstream soup and snack businesses, Campbell has been streamlining its operations by disposing its international and fresh businesses, including Bolthouse Farms and Garden Fresh Gourmet salsa. The company has introduced new soup recipes with added chicken and tomatoes and eliminated preservatives to also draw in health-conscious customers. 
""It was great to see growth in soup. It's the first time in quite a number of years that we've been able to drive growth on the business,"" Chief Executive Officer Mark Clouse told analysts on a call to discuss earnings. 
Camden, New Jersey-based Campbell, which also makes Prego pasta sauces, Kettle potato chips and Perpperidge Farm cookies, reported its best gross margin in six quarters. Shares rose 8.2% to $46.87 in morning trading. 
The quality of Campbell's fourth-quarter results was strong and the outlook for the rest of the year was better than feared, given the impact of divestitures, J.PMorgan analyst Ken Goldman said. ""Momentum is on Campbell's side right now, and we expect a solid season of soup shipments ahead.""
Campbell said it expects net sales for fiscal 2020 to grow by 1%-3%, adjusted earnings per share to increase by 9%-11%.
Last month, Campbell said it would sell Kelsen Group, a unit known for Royal Dansk cookies, to a Ferrero affiliated company for $300 million. It is also selling its Arnott's biscuits and some of its international operations. 
For the quarter ended July 28, Campbell earned 42 cents, excluding items, beating Wall Street estimates by 1 cent, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Adjusted gross margins of 33.7% beat the Refinitiv forecast of 32.7%. Campbell said the comparative quarter included costs from its voluntary recall of Flavor Blasted Goldfish crackers in July 2018.

Net sales from continuing operations rose 2% to $1.78 billion compared with a year-ago quarter. The company recorded a net loss of $8 million, or 3 cents per share, compared with a profit of $94 million, or 31 cents per share.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Amazon.com (O:AMZN) defended its business strategies in India as it came under fire from a local trader group on Friday over discounted products on the global e-commerce giant's website.
New e-commerce foreign investment rules that took effect in India from February were designed to help small traders by curbing heavy online discounting, but traders have complained that big online retailers use complex business structures to circumvent the rules and continue to burn billions of dollars to offer discounts.
The issue has become one of the biggest trade irritants between New Delhi and Washington.
At an open panel discussion on Friday - organized by India's competition watchdog - the Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT) reiterated its concerns to Amazon's senior corporate counsel, Rahul Sundaram, sparking a heated public confrontation. The CAIT represents 500,000 merchants and traders in India.
Sundaram said Amazon was abiding by all the rules and does not influence prices of products its website, adding that the company provides growth opportunities to more than 500,000 sellers online.
The trade body, however, was in no mood to accept Sundaram's statement.
CAIT's Praveen Khandelwal pointed out to Sundaram that an air conditioning unit available at 42,000 rupees in the offline retail market was sold for 35,000 rupees on Amazon's website and asked what ""magic"" was used to offer such a discount.
Sundaram hit back with a personal example, saying he had once spent half a day once walking around New Delhi markets to buy an air conditioner and managed to secure a discount of 6,000 rupees.
""It is a factor of the entire retail market that you will get discounts,"" he said.
The new rules introduced in February followed complaints from small traders who said that the e-commerce giants used their control over inventory from affiliated vendors to create an unfair marketplace.
In June the Indian government warned Amazon and Walmart's (N:WMT) Flipkart that they must ensure compliance with the new regulation, adding that it will not allow deep discounts that affect small shopkeepers.
At one point during Friday's discussion, Amazon's Sundaram said the company's 57 warehouses in India provide logistics support to small sellers and traders, which served only to rile Khandelwal further.
""We are not small ... Don't call us small, please,"" came the CAIT representative's angry retort."

(Reuters) - U.S. stocks rose on Friday as an easing of trade tensions between the United States and China, and data showing solid domestic consumer spending abated concerns that major economies were on the brink of a recession.
The Commerce Department said consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, rose 0.6% last month after an unrevised 0.3% gain in June.
However, the pace of growth in consumption is unlikely to be sustained amid tepid income gains.
A sharp heightening of tensions this month after the U.S. and China slapped tariffs on each other's goods, caused panic across global markets and resulted in a key part of the U.S. yield curve, a closely-followed recession indicator, inverting.
The two economic superpowers gave signs on Thursday that they will resume trade talks, as the countries discussed the next round of in-person negotiations in September ahead of a looming deadline for additional U.S. tariffs.
That helped Wall Street rise more than 1% on Thursday and set the indexes on pace to post their best weekly gain since June. The benchmark S&P 500 (SPX) index is now 3% off its record high hit in late July.
""It is a continuation of what we saw yesterday and there is optimism that there's going to be some sort of progress, that seems to be the biggest factor,"" said Scott Brown, chief economist at Raymond James in St. Petersburg, Florida.
Trade sensitive technology (SPLRCT) and industrial stocks (SPLRCI) rose 0.58% and 0.81%, respectively, while chipmakers, which get a major portion of their revenue, jumped.
The Philadelphia chip index (SOX) was up 1.40%.
However, markets are bracing for a new round of U.S. tariffs on some Chinese goods that come into effect on Sunday.
""The market believes that there will be some type of negotiation, but there is real danger this trade conflict is going to last, especially with the magnitude of September tariffs,"" added Brown.
Hopes that the Federal Reserve would step in to impede any slowdown in economic growth as a result of the trade war, have led traders to fully price in an interest rate cut at the central bank meeting next month.
Investors are now watching out for the monthly jobs report and the manufacturing data next week to gauge the health of the U.S. economy, and gain insight regarding the Fed's path of future interest rate cuts.
At 9:55 a.m. ET the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) was up 122.64 points, or 0.47%, at 26,484.89, the S&P 500 (SPX) was up 12.43 points, or 0.43%, at 2,937.01 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) was up 27.33 points, or 0.34%, at 8,000.72.
Gains in markets were largely broad-based, with the defensive utilities (SPLRCU) and real estate sectors posting the smallest losses.
Ulta Beauty Inc (O:ULTA) tumbled 27.5% to the bottom of the S&P 500 after the cosmetics company cut its full-year profit forecast.
The biggest gainer on the benchmark index was  Campbell Soup  Co (N:CPB), which rose 6.2% after its quarterly profit beat estimates.
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners for a 2.41-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and a 1.79-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.
The S&P index recorded 33 new 52-week highs and no new low, while the Nasdaq recorded 26 new highs and 18 new lows."

OSLO (Reuters) - The asset management arm of Nordea (HE:NDAFI), one of the Nordics' biggest banks, said it is suspending purchases of Brazilian government bonds, the latest Nordic investor to take action in response to the outbreak of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) forest fires.
Nordea Asset Management said its current exposure to Brazilian sovereign bonds was approximately 100 million euros ($111 million).
Thousands of fires tearing through the Amazon in the past week have spawned an international crisis for Brazil, with public protests and world leaders voicing concern that President Jair Bolsonaro's government is doing too little to protect the world's largest tropical rainforest.
""We are taking action by temporarily quarantining Brazilian government bonds both denominated in USD and BRL, meaning no additional purchases and only potential selling action,"" Thede Ruest, head of Nordea emerging markets debt, told Reuters.
""If we assess positive developments, we can lift the quarantine prior to a set date – equally if the situation worsens, we may have to exclude Brazil government bonds from our universe,"" he added.
Helsinki-based Nordea Asset Management had 205 billion euros in total assets under management as of the end of 2018.
Other Nordic investors that have taken action as a result of the Amazon fires include KLP, a Norwegian pension fund with over $80 billion in assets under management.
Environmentalists claim most of the fires were illegally set by land speculators and ranchers seeking to expand pastures in the Amazon and who feel emboldened by Bolsonaro's criticism of excessive environmental protections. Bolsonaro has denied the fires were deliberate.
KLP said this week it was contacting U.S. firms in which it was invested that did significant business with agricultural producers in Brazil to ask for ""concrete actions"".
KLP said it had contacted U.S. firms  Bunge  (N:BG), Cargill (UL:CARG) and Archer Daniels Midland (N:ADM), in which KLP has invested 453 million crowns ($51 million) in stocks and bonds.
""We will also look into Norwegian companies which import soy products from Brazil in order to evaluate this and urge them to do all they can to protect the rainforests,"" Jeanett Bergan, KLP's head of responsible investment, said in a statement.
Meanwhile the asset management arm of Norwegian insurer  Storebrand  (OL:STB) said it would commit to a new deforestation policy as a result of the fires in the Amazon.
""Deforestation has been an important issue in our investments for a long time. Now, our role as an active owner will be intensified, in order to halt deforestation,"" CEO Jan Erik Saugestad.
In practice, this means Storebrand wants to have a portfolio of investments that by 2025 does not contribute to deforestation; that it would influence ""high-risk companies"", vote at annual general meetings and collaborate with other institutional investors on these issues.
Norway has worked closely with Brazil to protect the Amazon rainforest for more than a decade and has paid $1.2 billion into the Amazon Fund, to which it is by far the biggest donor.
However, in August Oslo suspended donations to the Amazon Fund after Brasilia blocked operations of a fund receiving the aid.

960,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 30, 2019 09:51AM ET</span>","Funds cut stocks to near three-year low, say correction risk significant: Reuters poll","By Rahul Karunakar
BENGALURU (Reuters) - Global funds in August recommended an increase to bonds and cash holdings to the highest since early 2013 at least and cut equities to the lowest since late 2016, penciling in a more than 45% chance of a significant correction in stock markets this year.
The Reuters Aug 9-29 asset allocation poll of nearly 40 wealth managers and chief investment officers in Europe, the United States, Britain, and Japan was taken as concerns increased about the U.S.-China trade war, which has stoked unrelenting demand for low-risk government debt.
The drag on global growth from the tariff conflict has pushed the U.S. yield curve to invert further this month, with 30-year Treasury yields setting all-time lows and stocks that benefit during economic expansions falling the most on Wall Street this week, underscoring recession concerns.
""Risks and fragilities have increased, pointing to the increased disconnect between the weakening fundamentals and high risk asset valuations,"" said Pascal Blanqué, chief investment officer at Europe's largest asset manager, Amundi in Paris.
""In the past few months, the narrative has been: bad news for the economy is good news for risk assets, supported by ultra-dovish central banks. Now, we are at a point in which bad news is starting to become bad news, with markets pricing increased recession risks.""
Overall equity exposure this month fell almost 1 percentage point to average 44.6% in the global balanced model portfolio from July's 45.7%, the lowest since November 2016.
At the same time, the poll not only suggested a cut to equities for the fifth month in a row, but an increase to key gauges of caution. Cash and bond holdings rose over 1 percentage point to the highest since early 2013 at least.
That cautious mood among international long-term investors does not line up with equity market strategists and brokers, who in a separate Reuters poll this week forecast world stocks to continue their rise over the coming year.
But both sets of respondents agreed the push and pull from expected policy easing and the U.S.-China trade war will whipsaw financial markets in coming months.
Still, a slim majority - 14 of 25 funds in the latest poll said the prospect of global monetary easing would still be a net positive for equities.
""Whilst this has been a difficult month for risk assets it still remains to be said that buying great businesses for the longer term still has its attractions,"" said Peter Lowman, chief investment officer at London-based Investment Quorum.
""This is an extraordinary time for both the equity and bond markets. For those global investors that are seeking income there are very little options left without increasing your appetite for risk.""
But the other 11 respondents said the effectiveness of central bank action was fading and political developments on the trade war will likely outweigh the benefits of monetary easing with sovereign yields already very low.
""Equities traditionally can rally for a period of time after the (yield) curve inverts. Geopolitical risk can cause markets to turn sharply, with a significant correction potentially a tweet away,"" said Craig Hoyda, senior quantitative analyst at Aberdeen Standard Investments in Edinburgh.
When asked on the probability of a significant correction in equity markets this year, the median response was 46% and the most pessimistic view came in at 90%.
What has not helped is the lack of clarity on what the U.S. or China want from trade negotiations, which have see-sawed almost each month.
But fund managers warned bets against central banks has been a losing strategy and will continue to be so for now.
""There is no doubt that the global economy remains in the balance whilst a resolution between the U.S. and China is not forthcoming. But the old adage 'don't fight the Fed' still holds up for many investors,"" said John Husselbee, head of multi-asset fund at Liontrust in London.
Some fund managers remained bullish on their outlook for equities.
""We continue to believe that international and emerging market stocks offer attractive valuations if economic and political conditions stabilize,"" said Alan Gayle, president at Via Nova Investment Management in Washington, D.C.
""We will gradually deploy some of the cash we built earlier in the year into stocks in industries that are less vulnerable to tit-for-tat trade actions and increasing political headwinds related to the 2020 presidential election.""

Wilson, who has worked at Ryanair for 22 years, has been in charge of negotiations with unions for the past two years as chief people officer. He will take over from Sept. 1, Ryanair said in a note to staff seen by Reuters.
Ryanair has been moving to a structure similar to that of British Airways-owner IAG (LON:ICAG) L> by operating an increasing number of subsidiaries.
Ryanair Holdings plc, Europe's largest low-cost airline group, is the parent company of Poland's Buzz, Austria's Lauda, Malta Air and Dublin-based Ryanair DAC, which Wilson will lead.
""Eddie will report directly to me as Group CEO and will join my weekly meeting, which will be attended by the Chief Executives of Ryanair DAC, Buzz, Laudamotion and Malta Air,"" O'Leary said in a note to staff.

Ryanair DAC operates most of Ryanair's fleet of more than 475 jets.
Wilson's appoinment comes just weeks after O'Leary's July announcement that Chief Operations Officer Peter Bellew would step down at the end of the year. Some observers had seen Bellew, a former CEO of Malaysia Airlines, as a possible future Ryanair chief executive.
Wilson takes over as Ryanair grapples with a wave of industrial action from unions in the United Kingdom, Spain and Portugal, but the impact on flights has so far been minimal.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Top fund manager Vanguard Group Inc will ask companies about the gender, age and race of their directors, adding pressure on U.S. companies to diversify their leadership.
Vanguard gave the guidance in its annual stewardship report scheduled to be released on Friday morning and seen by Reuters. With about $5 trillion under management and known for products like the Vanguard 500 index fund, (P:VOO) the firm wields much influence over executives and directors at major U.S. companies.
""We are expanding our focus to more explicitly urge boards to seek greater diversity across a wide range of personal characteristics, such as gender, race, ethnicity, national origin, and age,"" Vanguard wrote.
In addition, Vanguard asked boards to spell out their views on diversity, to broaden their search for minority candidates, and ""to prioritize adding diverse voices to their boards.""
Pressure has grown on U.S. companies to bring more women into senior leadership roles in recent years. It has been hastened by the #MeToo movement, a response to accusations of sexual assault and harassment in Hollywood and elsewhere.
Investors have not been as focused about adding minorities, however, and their gains have lagged.
Vanguard stopped short of seeking director-by-director details from companies, saying in its report it wanted descriptions ""at least on an aggregate basis,"" which a spokeswoman called sufficient. Other companies have gone further and detailed the specific race and gender of directors in their proxy statements such as at  Regional Management Corp . (N:RM)
Vanguard also gave details in the report about its proxy voting during the 12 months ended June 30. Among other things, Vanguard said it voted against 585 members of compensation committees who did not respond to shareholder feedback, and that it supported seven of 49 shareholder environmental proposals, a rate similar to the prior year.
Growing investor concern about environmental, social and governance issues has led fund firms to put more attention on the topics. On Monday, Vanguard's index fund rival BlackRock Inc (N:BLK) outlined how it cast more votes against chief executives serving on outside boards."

The initial recommendations, presented to Boeing's board of directors over the weekend, also include potentially creating a new permanent committee to review Boeing's aircraft design and development, company officials told Reuters. 
The new initiatives come from a special board panel set up to review how Boeing develops and builds aircraft after the two crashes. They are intended to boost the transparency of engineering decisions and accelerate efforts to share safety information as widely and swiftly as possible across Boeing's global businesses and factories.
Speaking to Reuters at an internal Safety Promotion Center at its manufacturing hub north of Seattle, Boeing Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg vowed to learn from the crashes as part of what he described as Boeing's role ""to preserve and improve"" the safety of global aviation over time.
""Our job is to make sure accidents don't happen,"" Muilenburg said. ""Whatever the cause is, we are going to learn, we are going to understand and we are going to make improvements.""
""Ultimately, what we learn from the crashes will be reflected here as well,"" Muilenburg added, referring to the hall of exhibits that highlight how some accidents have had an impact on the ways planes are designed and operated. Safety experts say this is part of a wider organized learning process credited with a sharp improvement in safety over the decades. 
A new addition to the center is a roughly six-foot wall of glass with water running over its face that bears the words, ""remembering those whose lives were lost in flight,"" along with the exact times of the crashes of Lion Air flight 610 and Ethiopian Airlines flight 302, and a tally of the dead. 
The committee's recommendations are the first structural shifts as part of the company's response to the ongoing crisis over the grounding of its 737 MAX after deadly accidents killed 346 people in Ethiopia and Indonesia. The changes will be rolled out over the next couple of months, pending further review and modifications, he said.
Changes within the company could also be informed by the outcome of crash investigations into both accidents, according to a Boeing spokesman. 
Muilenburg now receives granular weekly reports of potential safety issues discussed at meetings of rank-and-file engineers - something that did not happen in the past. Those engineers, numbering in the thousands, will report to chief engineers as opposed to being allocated to separate programs - a change designed to help them reach senior Boeing officials more effectively, though their specific jobs will not change.
GLOBAL SCRUTINY 
The proposed changes are designed to give greater line-of-sight from the company's top management into the heart of its industrial programs. 
Engineers currently meet to flag and debate potential safety issues on a weekly basis, known internally as safety review boards. The committee recommended ""elevating"" the meetings to higher raking officials including Muilenburg to add more ""transparency and visibility,"" he said. ""I'm now getting weekly reports that are very valuable.""
The board's review is just one of numerous probes into the development of the 737 MAX by global regulators and U.S. lawmakers and the Department of Justice. Boeing also faces more than 100 lawsuits by victims' families alleging it designed a flawed airplane and other issues. 
Boeing has apologized for the lives lost and is upgrading critical flight control software at the center of both crashes. But it has stopped short of admitting any faults in how it developed the 737 MAX, or the software, which repeatedly pushed the plane's nose down while the pilots struggled to intervene. 
""We have been very thorough in looking at every step of the design process, certification process, going all the way back to the original requirements,"" Muilenburg said. ""We feel very confident in how that was done. But that doesn't mean we stop learning.""
No employee has been fired over the development of the 737 MAX, he said.
Boeing Commercial Airplanes Chief Engineer John Hamilton told Reuters that Boeing and European rival Airbus SE meet several times a year to share data on safety.

""The next time we get together, I am sure we will be sharing learnings from the MAX accidents,"" Hamilton said.

ZURICH (Reuters) - Sunrise Communications' (S:SRCG) proposed takeover of Liberty Global's (O:LBTYA) Swiss UPC business faces a revolt with at least two big investors joining top shareholder  Freenet  in opposing the 6.3 billion Swiss franc ($6.46 billion) deal, sources said.
A third was also expressing reservations about Switzerland's biggest telecoms acquisition, the sources told Reuters.
Germany's Freenet (DE:FNTGn), which owns nearly a quarter of Sunrise, has said it will vote against a 4.1 billion franc rights issue Sunrise has proposed to help finance the purchase.
If Freenet finds enough allies, the capital increase may lack the simple majority needed at an extraordinary shareholder meeting that Sunrise would call after the transaction gets anti-trust clearance.
""The deal has to be significantly restructured,"" one top-10 Sunrise shareholder said on condition of anonymity. ""We would prefer it did not take place at all.""
The dissident shareholders are not convinced by the deal that Sunrise has defended as a path to better compete against Swiss heavyweight  Swisscom  (S:SCMN).
Sunrise's strength is in mobile, so buying the UPC cable business would bulk up its ability to bundle cell phone, broadband internet, television and landline services as a way to win share in Switzerland's competitive market.
""The deal makes strategic sense, but the price is wrong,"" said a top-20 shareholder, who said he would vote against the capital increase. ""The UPC deal hardly creates value while carrying high risks for shareholders.""
Such acquisitions rarely produce the envisioned synergies and often cost more than planned, this shareholder said. ""At the moment we assume the deal in its current form has no chance.""
The top-10 investor questioned the strategic logic, noting UPC Switzerland had been shrinking since the end of 2017. In contrast to Sunrise, he did not see a big turnaround soon.
""In our view UPC is still a restructuring case,"" he said.
Based on valuations for peers like Belgian cable group Telenet (BR:TNET), a purchase price of around 4 billion francs would be appropriate, he estimated.
He also said Sunrise had agreed to assume UPC debt with an average interest rate above what Sunrise would have to pay, saddling it with extra costs.
""Is this transaction necessary at all? We are skeptical,"" he said, suggesting Sunrise was better off as a standalone entity that should focus on rolling out new 5G technology that could one day make cable obsolete.
Another investor displeased with the deal said it saw two scenarios: with Freenet refusing to take part, shareholders approve the capital hike that will pour new shares into the market, or else investors block the plan, forcing Sunrise to pay a 50 million franc break fee.
""In addition there is a high probability that Sunrise management leaves"" should the plan it has pushed so hard fail, a representative of this shareholder said.
Sunrise finance chief Andre Krause told Reuters he was ""very sure"" of winning a majority for the transaction with or without Freenet's backing. Sunrise would meet its top 30 to 50 shareholders over the next three weeks to sound out whether it needed to change the financing plans for the deal, he added.
He said Sunrise was ready to cut the size of the rights issue by at least 1.5 billion francs. Liberty has said it was not prepared to change the agreed sale price.
Top shareholders such as Canadian pension fund CPP, with 5%, and Germany's Shareholder Value Management declined comment.
Shareholder Value, with a nearly 3% Sunrise stake at the end of July, is also a Freenet shareholder.

The world's largest steelmaker, whose plant in the central town of Zenica processes iron ore from its Omarska mines in Prijedor, said in May it planned to cut output by a third to 1 million tonnes and cut jobs from Sept. 1 to prolong the life of the mines.
In January, its application to bid for the Serb Republic government's stake in the nearby Ljubija iron ore mine was rejected, prompting the steelmaker to warn of risks to the future of mining in the area.
Ljubija would have provided it with more sustainable ore supplies over a longer period. The company is still pressing for involvement in the project, according to sources.
The firm said in a statement it was in talks with the government of Bosnia's autonomous Serb Republic, where the mines are located, about ""serious issues that currently stand in the way of a long-term sustainable future"" of its mining business.
It said it had ""made it clear that without a satisfactory resolution of these matters, it will have no choice but to reduce current operational capacity and regrettably, ArcelorMittal Prijedor's workforce"".
ArcelorMittal has idled a series of plants across Europe, cut production in others and slowed a planned ramp-up of production at Ilva, Europe's largest steel plant that was acquired by ArcelorMittal last year.
It said it was looking at further cost-saving initiatives, such as reducing the working week, cutting contractor costs and using less expensive raw materials."

The European Commission said the project, which will run until the end of next year, complies with EU state aid rules, which seek to ensure that EU governments do not grant unfair support to companies.
When it announced the plan in June, the Polish government said that around 300 companies would be entitled to receive compensation.
The EU has criticized Poland for its heavy use of polluting coal for electricity. However, the Polish government has said the scheme would encourage companies to stay in Poland and not move production elsewhere.
""The scheme will avoid an increase in global greenhouse gas emissions due to companies relocating to countries outside the EU with less stringent environmental regulation,"" the EU competition enforcer said in a statement.
Wholesale power prices in Poland soared last year as carbon emission costs and coal prices surged because the country generates most of its electricity from coal.
Companies eligible for the compensation scheme must submit appropriate documents to the energy regulator by end of March every year."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Bruce Gendelman wanted a mountainside retreat when he bought 12 acres in Aspen, Colorado. But forest fires that have torched nearby land in recent years left him concerned.
So Gendelman, who runs an insurance brokerage, tapped into a program that American International Group Inc (N:AIG) offers to help design luxury properties in ways that mitigate disaster risk. A risk specialist made sure his home had a lightning-repellant system, cisterns to hold water run-off and ceramic shingles that look like wood. Just in case a blaze does break out, his driveway was designed to accommodate a fire truck's maneuvers.
""It's a very high-end home and we're dealing with very good contractors,"" Gendelman said. ""But (the AIG program) brought them systems they never used and resources they never heard of.""
Fires, floods, hurricanes and other catastrophes have cost https://tmsnrt.rs/2Zq5hUs U.S. insurers more than $170 billion in property losses since 2016, according to Property Claim Services (PCS), part of  Verisk Analytics Inc  (O:VRSK), and the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis.
Few actuaries expect the trend to ease as climate change accelerates, and the swell of claims has prompted some insurers to get involved in the design process for lavish residential properties.
Insurers and industry groups said they do not track data on the service, which is still a tiny part of the property-casualty insurance industry. But executives, real-estate developers and brokers, builders and analysts who spoke to Reuters said they believe it will only expand.
""People don't naturally think of insurance as the first place to go,"" said Jennifer Naughton, head of North American personal insurance risk consulting services at Chubb Ltd (BN:CB). ""But an insurance company can give you an advantage of the loss potential and might save you the pain of loss in the future.""
Chubb's risk managers make sure homeowners who request the service have water storage on the property to supplement the local fire department's resources, and recommend devices that allow emergency workers to open electronic entry gates, among other measures.
The trend is not entirely new: PURE Insurance has offered the service since its founding in 2007, and others have quietly made risk specialists available to customers who are designing a home and know to ask for the service. But it is now picking up steam as a stand-alone business at some major property-casualty insurers, as more clients worry about extreme weather.
AIG started marketing its service as ""Smart Build"" in 2015. Initially, only residential construction projects that cost more than $5 million were eligible, but AIG lowered the threshold to $1 million two years later.
AIG would not say how many homes it has helped design in total, but a spokesman said there were 20% more projects enrolled during the first six months of 2019 than in the prior-year period.
Cincinnati Insurance Companies joined the fray more recently, as did Vault, a high net-worth insurer launched in 2017 by a group of former AIG executives. W.R. Berkley Corp is also looking to offer the service as it ramps up business with wealthy clientele.

FINE ART PROTECTION
The home design process typically begins with an insurance risk specialist scoping out a site to assess possible dangers. For instance, if there is a high water table underground or a nearby body of water, they may suggest elevating the home or choosing another place to build to avoid the risk of flooding.
Ken Vona, who heads KVC Builders LLC and frequently teams up with PURE, recalled a couple who decided against a location because the house would have to be raised some 18 feet (5.5 m)off the ground to guard against flood risk.
""A perfect example of 'bad piece of property, nice view,'"" he said.
Once a site is selected, specialists review architectural plans, making sure designs are resistant to water and fire damage, among other risks. They scrutinize plumbing layouts, help design hurricane-proof storage rooms to protect valuables, vet the adequacy of sprinkler systems, measure driveway entrances and make sure there is a hydrant nearby.
Cameron Strothman, a senior risk manager for AIG Private Client Group, said he once had to figure out how to protect a site that was four miles away from the nearest hydrant. He liaised with the local fire department and advised the client to install a 30,000-gallon tank under the driveway so that fire trucks could tap a private water source instead. It cost $35,000.
Risk specialists' suggestions generally represent 10 to 15% of total building costs, insurance experts said.
Some of the features are things homebuilders would likely install anyway, like a sophisticated fire alarm or sprinkler system, or measures required by building codes. Others cost very little money but can prevent extremely expensive damage. For instance, there is a $100 sensor that shuts off water systems after detecting a leak.
Adding these features at the time of construction is also cheaper than doing so once the home is built, risk experts said. A protective storage room for fine art may run less than $100,000 if designed into the plans compared to millions of dollars later, said Steve Bitterman, Vault's chief risk services officer.
Gendelman would not disclose the costs associated with building or protecting his home, but said AIG did not charge him for the advice.
""Providing this service free is smart for everyone,"" he said. ""They help me with ideas and they get a loyal client."""

The economic slowdown that would result from a no-deal Brexit, as well as the likelihood of lower interest rates and borrowers defaulting on loans, would hit earnings per share by between 15 to 25%, the analysts at Citi wrote in the note published on Thursday.
The research is one of the most concrete assessments yet of the impact of no-deal on Britain's banking sector, which has thus far shown few signs of the impact of Brexit other than declining confidence among business and retail customers.
Royal Bank of Scotland (L:RBS) on Aug. 2 said deteriorating economic conditions before Brexit were likely to derail next year's profitability, and that some customers were already struggling.
The impact of a no-deal scenario on the shares of big British lenders  Barclays  (L:BARC), HSBC (L:HSBA), Lloyds (L:LLOY), RBS (L:RBS) and  Standard Chartered  (L:STAN) could be more muted, the Citi analysts said, as the risks of that outcome are already partly priced in.

977,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 30, 2019 07:05AM ET</span>","Exclusive: Amid crisis, China rejected Hong Kong plan to appease protesters - sources","By James Pomfret and Greg Torode
HONG KONG (Reuters) - Earlier this summer, Carrie Lam, the chief executive of Hong Kong, submitted a report to Beijing that assessed protesters' five key demands and found that withdrawing a contentious extradition bill could help defuse the mounting political crisis in the territory.
The Chinese central government rejected Lam's proposal to withdraw the extradition bill and ordered her not to yield to any of the protesters' other demands at that time, three individuals with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters.
China's role in directing how Hong Kong handles the protests has been widely assumed, supported by stern statements in state media about the country's sovereignty and protesters' ""radical"" goals.
Beijing's rebuff of Lam's proposal for how to resolve the crisis, detailed for the first time by Reuters, represents concrete evidence of the extent to which China is controlling the Hong Kong government's response to the unrest.
The Chinese central government has condemned the protests and accused foreign powers of fuelling unrest. The Foreign Ministry has repeatedly warned other nations against interfering in Hong Kong, reiterating that the situation there is an ""internal affair.""
Lam's report on the tumult was made before an Aug. 7 meeting in Shenzhen about the Hong Kong crisis led by senior Chinese officials. The report examined the feasibility of the five demands of the protesters, analyzing how conceding to some of these might quiet things down, the individuals with direct knowledge said.
In addition to the withdrawal of the extradition bill, the other demands analyzed in the report were: an independent inquiry into the protests; fully democratic elections; dropping of the term ""riot"" in describing protests; and dropping charges against those arrested so far.
The withdrawal of the bill and an independent inquiry were seen to be the most feasible politically, according to a senior government official in the Hong Kong administration, who spoke on condition of anonymity. He said the move was envisioned as helping pacify some of the more moderate protesters who have been angered by Lam's silence.
The extradition bill is one of the key issues that has helped drive the protests, which have drawn millions of people into the streets of Hong Kong. Lam has said the bill is ""dead,"" but has refused to say explicitly that it has been ""withdrawn.""
Beijing told Lam not to withdraw the bill, or to launch an inquiry into the tumult, including allegations of excessive police force, according to the senior government official.
Another of the three individuals, who has close ties with senior officials in Hong Kong and also declined to be identified, confirmed the Hong Kong government had submitted the report.
""They said no"" to all five demands, said the source. ""The situation is far more complicated than most people realize.""
The third individual, a senior Chinese official, said that the Hong Kong government had submitted the report to the Central Co-ordination Group for Hong Kong and Macau Affairs, a high-level group led by Politburo Standing Committee member Han Zheng, and that President Xi Jinping was aware of it.
The official confirmed that Beijing had rejected giving in to any of the protesters' demands and wanted Lam's administration to take more initiative.
In a statement responding to Reuters, Lam's office said her government had made efforts to address protesters' concerns, but did not comment directly on whether it had made such a proposal to Beijing, or received instructions.
Written questions to China's Foreign Ministry were referred to the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office (HKMAO), a high-level bureau under China's State Council. HKMAO did not respond to a faxed request for comment.
Reuters has not seen the report. The news agency also was unable to establish the precise timing of the rejection.
The two Hong Kong sources said the report was submitted between June 16 - the day after Lam announced the suspension of the extradition bill - and Aug. 7, when the HKMAO and China's representative Liaison Office in Hong Kong held a forum in nearby Shenzhen attended by nearly 500 pro-establishment figures and businesspeople from Hong Kong.
The question of Beijing's influence strikes at the heart of Hong Kong's ""one country, two systems"" governance, which promised the city a high degree of autonomy and wide-ranging freedoms that don't exist in mainland China.
More than two months of protests have embroiled Hong Kong in its most severe crisis since the former British colony returned to Chinese rule in 1997.
What began as a movement to oppose the extradition bill, which would have allowed people to be sent to China for trial in Communist Party controlled courts, has morphed into a broader campaign for greater rights and democracy in a direct challenge to Beijing.
'HER HANDS ARE TIED'
Ip Kwok-him, a senior pro-Beijing politician who sits on Hong Kong's elite Executive Council, which advises senior officials, including Lam, told Reuters that ""if the central government won't allow something, you can't do it."" Ip did not know about the proposal to withdraw the bill.
A senior businessman who attended the Shenzhen meeting and has met with Lam recently said ""her hands are tied"" and Beijing wouldn't let her withdraw the bill. The businessman spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter.
At the Shenzhen meeting, Zhang Xiaoming, the head of the HKMAO, said in televised public remarks that if the turmoil persisted, ""the central government must intervene.""
Since then, there have been signs of Beijing taking a harder line.
For instance, officials have likened some protests to ""terrorism,"" Chinese paramilitary police have conducted drills near the border, several Hong Kong companies have been pressured to suspend staff supporting the protests, and security personnel have searched the digital devices of some travelers entering China.

On Friday, Joshua Wong, a prominent democracy activist, was arrested, according to his political party, Demosisto.

978,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 30, 2019 07:03AM ET</span>",Picking a Bank CEO in Europe. How Hard Can it Be?,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Picking a new CEO is one of the most important decisions a board can take, yet one that Europe’s banks appear to be intent on flubbing. Lenders are struggling to find successors for the current crop of leaders.
Take UBS Group AG (NYSE:UBS). On Thursday, the Swiss bank revamped its management board, hiring a star banker from a rival and promoting two more insiders. Yes, the revamp is a step forward for gender diversity for firm whose senior ranks were distinctly lacking in women, and the appointees may turn out to be potential candidates for the top job in future years.
But the reshuffle is also a sign that the number of potential internal successors for CEO Sergio Ermotti isn’t as big as it should be by now. Almost eight years into his tenure, the chairman and board of directors have few excuses. By now, there should already be several candidates just about ready to replace him.
UBS isn’t alone in grappling with succession. Hours after naming a new CEO,   Swedbank AB   (OTC:SWDBY) was criticized by Sweden’s biggest shareholder group for picking such an insider – and one who had failed to prevent the bank from engaging in alleged money laundering. Given the scandal wiped more than 40% off the bank’s shares this year and triggered the exit of the previous CEO, discontinuity wouldn’t have hurt.
Then there’s Santander SA (NYSE:SAN). A year ago, the Spanish bank hired UBS’s then investment-banking chief, Andrea Orcel, as its new CEO. Yet before he had even started the two fell out over compensation and are now locked in an acrimonious legal battle after Santander rescinded its offer. Santander resorted to asking the existing executive to stay in the job, raising doubts both about how the board came to hire Orcel in the first place.
Among the global finance titans, HSBC (NYSE:HSBC) ousted CEO John Flint earlier this month. He was just 18 months into the job. Tensions with Chairman Mark Tucker and a clash of style were among the reasons for the exit, Bloomberg News reported. Surely the HSBC lifer’s strengths and weaknesses would have been a known quantity to the board by the time he was appointed.
Europe’s diverse languages and cultures that go along with them do make filling the CEO post more challenging than in the U.S., but that means the boards and the incumbent executives should be even more focused on the task of avoiding leaving succession to chance.
It would help to align CEOs’ pay more closely with how they have groomed and retained top talent so that if they were to be hit by the proverbial bus an internal replacement would be on hand. While financial targets are clearly important for any CEO, shielding the company from potential instability if they were to leave is perhaps an underrated but critical function.
It’s up to shareholders to ramp up the pressure on companies’ boards. Choosing the right CEO is only going to get tougher as technology advances alter the economics, competitive landscape and opportunities. The next wave of CEOs may not be working in finance right now. Boards’ poor showing of late should be a cause for investor concern. "

LONDON (Reuters) - World stocks rose to a one-week high on cautious hopes for a rapprochement on trade between Beijing and Washington on Friday, though a perky dollar capped gains with China's yuan softening again, on track for its weakest month in 2-1/2 decades.
For most of August global stocks have reeled and fixed income shone as deepening concerns over global trade and clear signs of a slowdown, possibly even a recession, in the global economy loomed large over financial markets.
But the mood lifted after U.S. President Donald Trump said some trade discussions were taking place with China on Thursday, with more talks scheduled. China's commerce ministry also said a September round of meetings was being discussed by the two sides, but added it was important for Washington to cancel a tariff increase.
The MSCI All-Country World Index climbed 0.3% but is on track for a near 3% decline in August - only the second month the benchmark has spent in the red this year. It is the weakest August for the index since 2015.
European stocks on Friday extended the previous session's gains, with the pan-European STOXX 600 index up 0.3% to trade at a fresh one-month high.
""The trade war seesaw has certainly moved back in favor of riskier assets for now, with Trump and China supposedly holding a call yesterday,"" said  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) strategist Jim Reid.
Gains were helped by a surge in German real estate firms which saw the country's DAX index add 0.7%.
GRAPHIC: Stocks in Aug - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/12/5433/5383/stocks%20in%20Aug.png
The picture was more mixed in Asia, where Chinese and Hong Kong stock markets dipped in and out of the red. Arrests or detentions of pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong added to investor jitters, with the Chinese-ruled territory facing its first recession in a decade. 
Japan's Nikkei added 1.2%, while South Korea's KOSPI jumped 1.8%.
U.S. futures pointed to a firmer start to the day's trade, with E-Minis for the S&P500 up 0.3% after more than 1% gain on Wall Street overnight.
Fixed income markets took a breather on Friday, at the end of a stellar month that has seen prices rally and borrowing costs push deeper and deeper into negative territory.
U.S. Treasury yields nudged higher overnight, with the benchmark 10-year Treasury climbing to 1.5349% from a three-year low of 1.443% touched earlier this week. 
It was still below two-year yields at 1.5419%. Such an inversion was last seen in 2007 and correctly foretold the great recession that followed a year later.
Euro zone government bond yields were steady near record lows as data showed the bloc's inflation remained low at 1.0% in August, well below the European Central Bank's target and bolstering expectations for European Central Bank stimulus in September.
Germany is considering lowering its corporate tax rate, while the U.S. government is thinking about issuing 50- and 100-year bonds in a bid to steepen the yield curve.
Recent economic data has also pointed to a global growth slowdown with business investment, manufacturing activity and exports all going south across major economies.
Investors were focused on a string of economic releases due over the weekend including China's official manufacturing survey, which would provide a good gauge of the real impact from the Sino-U.S. trade war.
GLUM YUAN
In currency markets, the dollar nudged to a one month high of 98.609 against a basket of six major currencies.
Yet the trade optimism failed to inspire China's yuan, which resumed its decline with spot yuan at 7.1462 against the dollar. The currency is on track for its weakest month since Beijing's currency reform in 1994 after it broke through the key 7 to the dollar level earlier in August. 
""The yuan move back to 7 and beyond has been a distinct possibility for months. It is clearly down due to the tariffs,"" said Neil Mellor, senior FX strategist at BNY Mellon in London.
""It does help them to some extent to absorb the tariff costs - it is one of the few options they have. The fiscal option is limited after years of excess, and the monetary stimulus has already been unprecedented this year.""
The Australian dollar, often seen as a proxy bet on the Chinese economy, slipped towards a 10-year trough.
Elsewhere, the euro plunged to a one-month low against the dollar, as investors looked for aggressive easing by the European Central Bank and ignored doubts by some policymakers about the need for more stimulus.
The Japanese yen stood at 106.40 to the dollar, while the euro was 0.2% down at $1.10395.
Sterling was steady at $1.2182 against the dollar ahead of a crucial few days for parliament next week which could even result in a no-confidence motion and a new election.
In commodities, spot gold came off recent highs to trade at $1,526 an ounce. Silver was at $18.37 an ounce after hitting its highest level in more than two years.

U.S. crude slipped 57 cents to $56.14 a barrel while Brent fell 30 cents to $60.78 a barrel.

981,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 30, 2019 05:34AM ET</span>",Month of bond market milestones - How low can you go?,"By Dhara Ranasinghe, Ritvik Carvalho and Tom Arnold
LONDON (Reuters) - August has turned out to be another month of milestones for bond markets as an escalating trade conflict fans recession fears, pushing borrowing costs deeper and deeper into negative territory.
Some $16 trillion of global debt, including corporate and sovereign bonds, now yield less than 0%, up from almost $13 trillion in early July.
Investors, desperate to grab any yield, have rushed into longer-dated bonds: U.S. 30-year borrowing costs are down 60 basis points in August, set for their biggest monthly decline since the 2011 euro debt crisis.
Long-dated Japanese bond yields have also hit three-year lows and are set for their biggest monthly declines in more than three years.
""The bond market is sending a clear message that it expects low economic growth and low inflation,"" said Neil MacKinnon, global macro strategist at VTB Capital in London. ""It is saying: secular stagnation, here we come.""
Biggest monthly fall in 30-year USTs since 2011 - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/MARKETS-MILESTONES-FACTBOX/0H001QESK83L/index.html
Here are a few milestones charted by bond markets as the great yield collapse of 2019 unfolds:
1/INVERTED!
A key part of the U.S. Treasury yield curve, a closely tracked recession indicator, inverted in mid-August for the first time in 12 years and further still in recent days.
The curve, measured by the gap between two- and 10-year U.S. bond yields, has inverted before every recession in the past 50 years and sent a false signal just once.
No wonder that the warning signal from the world's most important bond market has rippled out. Britain's bond yield curve briefly inverted this month. The German curve is at its flattest since the global financial crisis.
""Given there hasn't been a single lead indicator as good as the yield curve at predicting U.S. downturns in the past 70 years, the inversion has to be taken very seriously,"" said  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) strategist Jim Reid.

2/THE NEGATIVE CURVE CLUB
Sovereign bond yield heatmap - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/12/5334/5286/bondmarketmilestones.png
In early August, 30-year German and Dutch borrowing costs fell below 0%, bringing the two countries into a club of developed countries, whose entire sovereign bond yield curves pay negative yields. Finland now joined them.
The group already included Denmark and Switzerland. It was briefly joined in mid-August by Sweden, which saw yields on its longest-dated bond, a 20-year maturity, drop below 0% for the first time.
Japan could be the next to join, with bond yields out to 15 years below 0%.
With investors willing to pay governments to hold their debt, pressure is rising on the likes of fiscally prudent Germany to use unprecedented market funding conditions to ramp up spending and fight weak growth.
3/ AND THE U.S. TOO?
Technically speaking, the United States also now has negative-yielding bonds. Of late, yields on 10-year Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS), securities offering protection against inflation, have pushed into negative territory.
The yield on a TIPS security essentially is the yield on a plain-vanilla Treasury bond, minus expected inflation. Given 10-year TIPs now yield minus 0.07%, it means the equivalent Treasury bond is paying less than the expected inflation rate.
U.S. TIPS yield - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/USA-BONDS-TIPS/0H001QES982T/eikon.png
4/PAID TO TAKE A MORTGAGE
Jyske Bank this month became the first in Denmark to offer a negative rate on a mortgage, in effect paying customers 0.5% to borrow money for 10 years.
The borrowers would still make monthly payments towards the initial amount they borrow, but they would eventually pay back less than the original amount.
While rare, the move in Denmark is part of a broader trend in tumbling mortgage rates globally. Borrowing costs on U.S. 30-year and 15-year fixed-rate mortgages have fallen to their lowest since November 2016.
5/FIRST SIGN OF TROUBLE?
There are some signs that investors' willingness to hold negative-yielding debt is being sorely tested. Last week, Germany auctioned a 30-year government bond at negative yields. But the euro zone's benchmark bond issuer sold just 824 million euros, versus a 2 billion-euro target.
That's a sign some private investors are being driven out of the higher-rated euro debt markets by negative yields. The new 30-year Bund had a 0% coupon, which means investors who hold the bond to maturity get nothing back.

6/ NOT ALL BONDS ARE EQUAL
Not all bonds are partaking in the rally. Since President Mauricio Macri lost an Aug 11 primary election round to populist-leaning opposition candidate Alberto Fernandez, the tumble on Argentine dollar bonds has hit many investors, including some big-name asset managers such as Franklin Templeton.
Argentina's 100-year dollar bond, issued in 2017 at par, has been hard hit, too, falling more than a third in five days. The price, which lurched even lower after the government said on Aug. 28 it would launch a debt reprofiling plan, currently trades at 43 cents in the dollar.

982,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 30, 2019 05:34AM ET</span>","StockBeat: Europe Markets Rise, But Still Set for Monthly Loss","By Geoffrey Smith
Investing.com -- Nothing says “dog days of summer” quite like stock markets rallying on the basis of the “hopes” of a diplomat.
Europe’s stock markets were following the U.S. and Asia higher on Friday, still supported by the nebulous comments of Gao Feng, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesman, on Thursday, saying that he “hopes” the U.S. would cancel its plans to impose additional tariffs on Chinese imports and return to the negotiating table.
The word “hope” has done a lot of heavy lifting in the last 24 hours, as investors have seemingly forgotten the reality that a new raft of U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports comes into force at the weekend, and that nothing has essentially changed in a struggle for supremacy in the global economy that, for all that it is conducted in the language of trade measures on a day-to-day basis.
By 5 AM ET (0900 GMT), the benchmark Euro Stoxx 600 was up 0.7% at 379.48, although that’s still over 2% below where it was before Trump escalated the trade angle of the conflict with the announcement of new tariffs at the start of the month.
The U.K. FTSE 100 was up 0.5%, while the German DAX was up 1.0%.
With the exception of Italy, which appears to have ended its latest political crisis, and the seemingly impregnable Danish market, all of Europe’s bourses are down for the month. The fact that defensive-dominated Switzerland is down only 0.1%, while high-beta Russia is down over 5%, says a lot.
Nor does September promise any immediate relief. It’s only two weeks until the European Central Bank is due to unveil what is expected to be a “package deal” of measures to stimulate the economy, including a lower deposit rate, cheaper long-term financing (the so-called TLTROs) and – possibly – a resumption of quantitative easing.
ING analyst Carsten Brzeski says he expects the ECB to resume buying bonds at a rate of 30 billion euros a month, half of its previous peak. However, three of the ECB’s biggest hawks on the governing council have spoken out against resuming QE this week, the Netherlands’ Klaas Knot adding his voice yesterday to those of the two German representatives on the council. Knot said market expectations were “overdone”.
An area where there may be greater hope for new impetus is Brexit. Sterling has refused to fall significantly below $1.22 or €1.10 despite the increasingly extreme measures taken by Prime Minister Boris Johnson in pursuit of a policy whose likeliest outcome is a disorderly “no-deal” Brexit. That suggests that a huge amount of bad news on the Brexit front has already been priced in. If, by some miracle, a hard Brexit can be avoided, there should be plenty of room for a relief rally. "

The autos sector, Britain's biggest exporter of goods, has been one of the most vociferous opponents of a no-deal Brexit, warning that production would be hit with tariffs, border delays and new bureaucracy, ruining the viability of plants.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson has promised that Britain will leave the European Union on Oct. 31 with or without a deal.
Toyota built just over 8% of Britain's 1.52 million cars last year at its Burnaston factory in Derbyshire and began production of its new Corolla model there earlier this year.
""We will have a production pause on the first day of Brexit, which is Friday 1st, and... then we will restart production on the Monday and the Tuesday,"" said a spokesman.
""We don't know what the actual situation will be like. We've already pulled forward a couple of days of extra inventory which we will then use on the Monday and Tuesday and we will have to see what the situation is after that,"" he said.
British car factories are integrated into supply chains which can stretch around the world and operate just-in-time manufacturing processes which mean some parts arrive minutes before being fitted onto vehicles rolling off production lines.
Toyota said no volume would be lost from the pause in output."

With a planned capital expenditure budget of 1.7 trillion yen ($16 billion) during the period, the company could cut between 170 billion to 340 billion yen ($1.6 billion to $3.2 billion) in spending.
Slowing global steel demand for automobiles and machinery because of the trade row and higher materials costs have battered Japanese steelmakers' quarterly earnings, forcing them to cut their annual forecasts or give bleak guidance.
Earlier this month, Nippon Steel, Japan's top steelmaker, reported a 33% drop in business profit for the April to June quarter and predicted a 56% plunge in profit for the year through March 2020.
The world's third-biggest steelmaker said at the time that it would reduce planned capital expenditure and sell assets worth 200 billion yen in light of the slumping earnings and to maintain financial health.
""We have already largely picked targets worth about a 10 percent cut,"" Yuichiro Kaneko, head of the investor relations department at Nippon Steel, told Reuters by phone.
Some planned spending on regular maintenance or upgrades for its domestic plants will be delayed, while spending to bolster the efficiency of some production facilities may be delayed as it prioritizes repairs and upgrades on the facilities with higher efficiency, he said.
Nippon Steel Executive Vice President Katsuhiro Miyamoto told Reuters earlier this week that it aims to raise product prices and boost productivity by streamlining its manufacturing structure to help shore up faltering earnings.
Demand for flat steel used in automobiles and machinery is slowing in China, prompting fears of an increase in regional exports at a time when the broader Asian economy is stumbling due to trade war, he told Reuters in an interview."

It was the clearest sign to date of a succession plan for Fredriksen, whose net worth has been estimated at more than $12 billion.
His self-made business empire includes oil-tanker firm Frontline (OL:FRO), dry bulk shipper  Golden Ocean  (O:GOGL) (OL:GOGLT) and rig owner  Seadrill  (OL:SDRL) (N:SDRL), as well as fish farmer Mowi (OL:MOWI) and other companies.

""They should not have to live with the work load I've had,"" he added.
Instead, Fredriksen could seek to build even larger firms via mergers, and thus allow other industrial players to become the top owners of individual companies in his portfolio, he told TradeWinds, a shipping industry newspaper.
Another way to transfer power would be to bring outside investors with sufficient resources and skill into the companies as they are today, he added.
Frontline, one of the companies in the group, recently bought a fleet of oil tankers from Trafigura, making the Geneva-based trading house the second-largest owner of that firm with a stake of 8.5%, while Fredriksen holds 42%.
Frontline is also seeking further vessel acquisitions, he added.

The breach at Capital One between March and July was revealed late last month and stemmed from Capital One's decision to store data in Amazon's cloud unit, called Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Web Services (AWS), where a former employee named Paige Thompson managed to access its data.
Thompson's indictment cited more than 30 victims of data intrusion and theft, including Capital One, the DOJ said adding that the case is now headed for a federal court in Seattle.
The DOJ did not identify other companies whose data was allegedly breached by Thompson. However, it mentioned that some of the victims included a state agency outside the state of Washington, a telecommunications conglomerate outside the United States and a public research university outside Washington.
Thompson not only stole data, but also used stolen computer power to mine cryptocurrency for her own benefit, a practice known as ""cryptojacking,"" according to the indictment.
The 33-year-old software engineer made her initial appearance in a federal court in July. She remains in custody and her charges in the indictment carry penalties of up to 25 years in prison, according to the statement.
The data breach at Capital One resulted in the exposure of names and addresses of customers, the company said last month. The hacker did not gain access to credit card account numbers, but about 140,000 Social Security numbers and 80,000 linked bank account numbers were compromised."

SHANGHAI/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) has always shown disdain for marketing, with CEO Elon Musk boasting his company does not advertise, instead using the money it would have spent to develop products.
But in China, the world's biggest electric vehicle market where Tesla is gearing up for a major sales push, that tune has started to change as the automaker promotes racing events, showroom parties with DJs and a line of Chinese Tesla stickers for chat apps.
Case in point: Wang Yubo, a 30-year-old marketing executive and Tesla car owner, was invited by the company to burnish his driving skills at a Shanghai racing track this month.
""I learned how to push my Model 3 to its limits,"" said Wang, who writes both enthusiastic and critical blogs about Tesla and occasionally races his car with friends.
Tesla is expanding its focus beyond products to service, says Leo Liu, head of the company's China driving school which aims to teach people ""to make full use of their cars"".
It held three such events for auto reporters, social media influencers and a handful of owners in August - one in Beijing and two in Shanghai and plans to expand to other big cities such as Guangzhou and Chengdu.
""We are also thinking of having more difficult ones on ice tracks in winter this year,"" Liu said, adding that more owners will be invited in the future.
While Tesla hasn't embarked on conventional TV or billboard advertising, the U.S. firm's China Chief Tom Zhu has been working on strategies this year to boost the brand's appeal, frequently seeking ideas and opinions from marketing and sales experts, sources familiar with the discussions said.
The sources were not authorized to speak to the media and declined to be identified. Tesla declined to comment.
BIG FACTORY, BIG PLANS
Helping raise his profile in China, Musk is currently visiting the country and on Thursday held a discussion with Alibaba's (N:BABA) Jack Ma at an AI industry event, although they avoided controversial issues like the U.S.-China trade war.
Tesla's new efforts to reach customers in China come as the Silicon Valley automaker is preparing to open a big vehicle assembly factory in Shanghai and confront fierce competition in the luxury electric vehicle market it invented.
The firm's first overseas factory is due to start production by the end of the year and Tesla has said it should be able to build 3,000 Model 3 vehicles a week in its initial phases.
That would translate to nearly four times the number of imported Model 3 vehicles sold in China per month this year, according to figures from research firm LMC Automotive.
The plant is slated to have annual output capacity of 250,000 vehicles after production of the Model Y is added.
""We have to learn how to manage a larger sales and after-sales system as production is growing to a completely different level,"" said one source. ""That's why we are doing these events now.""
The sources added, however, that Tesla is spending far less than what a conventional carmaker in China would be spending on marketing.
In Tesla's favor, it has been exporting cars to China since 2014 and remains the benchmark that other automakers in China often compare their electric vehicles to when they advertise.
The launch of the Model 3 for the Chinese market in late February has also gone well, sending Tesla's China revenue jumping 42% to $1.5 billion in the first half - equivalent to 13.5% of total revenue.
But Tesla in China doesn't have the headstart in all-electric vehicles that it had in the U.S. market when it debuted the Model S in 2012.
Chinese startup Nio Inc (N:NIO) sells two premium all-electric SUVs, Jaguar has launched is I-PACE SUV and BMW (DE:BMWG) has its i3 hatchback and i8 sportscar. By the end of the year, Audi will have two all-electric SUVs on the market while Daimler's (DE:DAIGn) Mercedes will have one.
The U.S firm also doesn't expect Musk's cult status to propel sales to the same extent it does elsewhere, the sources said.
Most Chinese do not have easy access to his Twitter feed followed by nearly 28 million, although Tesla translates some of his less controversial tweets on its Weibo account.
In addition to chat app stickers that express various emotions - a market strategy also used by other automakers - Tesla is partnering with Tencent's (HK:0700) QQ Music streaming service in organizing parties with DJs at showrooms.
Both marketing tactics are China-only developments, the sources said.
Social media users have noticed much more activity on Tesla's Weibo account in recent months while company has also held several roundtables with reporters and internet influencers throughout China since July.
According to sources, executives explained pricing strategy and expansion plans for its charging network and said they wanted to improve communication with the public.
By contrast, in the United States Tesla rarely grants media access to its executives beyond earnings calls and product launches.
""Tesla has finally realized the importance of adjusting to China,"" said Wang. ""Given time, it will become more mature."""
990,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 30, 2019 12:55AM ET</span>","Tesla hikes prices for Model 3, other cars in China amid weaker yuan","SHANGHAI (Reuters) - U.S. electric vehicle maker Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) had raised prices for some vehicles in China as the yuan trades at its weakest levels in more than a decade. 
The starting price for the Model X sport utility vehicle (SUV) is now 809,900 yuan ($114,186), versus 790,900 yuan previously, according to Tesla's China website on Friday. 
Its long-range dual-motor variants of mass-market Model 3 cars are now 439,900 yuan, up from 429,900 yuan previously. 
The U.S.-China trade frictions and a tit-for-tat tariff war between the countries has prompted Tesla, which currently imports all the cars it sells in China, to adjust its prices multiple times over the past year.
The latest hike comes as China allowed the yuan to weaken against the U.S. dollar earlier this month, raising the cost of imports and prompting Washington to label China a currency manipulator. Beijing has strongly opposed the label.
People familiar with the matter told Reuters earlier this week that Tesla would hike prices due to the currency uncertainty and could do so again in December should Chinese tariffs on U.S.-made cars take effect. 
Tesla is currently building its first overseas factory in Shanghai, which is expected to help the firm minimize the impact of the trade war. It is due to start production by the end of the year and Tesla has said it should be able to build 3,000 Model 3 vehicles a week in its initial phases.

While Tesla does not disclose sales by country, consultancy LMC Automotive estimates it sold 23,678 vehicles in China in the first seven months this year, including 17,451 Model 3 cars.

The price of a basic level imported Model 3 sedan went to 363,900 yuan ($50,900) from 355,900 yuan, Tesla’s website showed Friday. Prices of other models also increased.
Tesla is among automakers most affected by the U.S.-China trade tensions, because it has no local production yet and therefore gets directly hit by any increases in tariffs. China threatened last week to increase duties on U.S.-made cars to as high as 50% in retaliation for President Donald Trump’s latest planned levies on Chinese goods.
Tesla is constructing a plant in China, an increasingly important market for the loss-making company as incentives for electric vehicles in the U.S. wane. Tesla plans to start producing cars at the factory near Shanghai, Tesla’s first outside of the U.S., by the end of 2019. Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk is currently visiting the region, making an appearance at the World Artificial Intelligence Conference on Thursday.
A decline in the yuan reduces the value of any earnings that Tesla brings back from China and converts to dollars. Earlier this week, the Chinese currency fell to an 11-year low against the dollar.

993,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 30, 2019 12:11AM ET</span>","Brazil sets sights on China's ethanol market, but high volumes unlikely","By Marcelo Teixeira
SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazil's ethanol industry is looking to grab a chunk of China's ethanol market as the Asian nation targets a 10% blend in gasoline to improve air quality, but a short-term jump in exports is unlikely, according to people following the matter.
China wants to add 10% of ethanol to all gasoline used in the country by 2020, a policy that could sharply boost the country's ethanol market and potentially increase imports, since local production capacity is too small to meet the target.
Brazilian ethanol industry representatives were part of a trade mission organized by the Sao Paulo state government that visited China this month. The mission's agenda included meetings with Chinese authorities and a visit to the headquarters of commodities trader COFCO, which owns four ethanol plants in Brazil.
Sao Paulo state is the largest ethanol producer in Brazil. The state's agriculture secretary, Gustavo Junqueira, who went along on this month's China visit, said the opening of China's ethanol market was discussed.
In a statement, Junqueira added that he thought Sao Paulo mills could sharply increase deals but did not elaborate.
Felipe Vicchiato, chief financial officer for Sao Martinho SA (SA:SMTO3), a large Brazilian ethanol producer, said Chinese officials seemed to be serious about the 10% ethanol plan during the talks. Sao Martinho's Chairman Marcelo Ometto was also part of the trade mission.
A source at COFCO, however, told Reuters it was unlikely China would implement the blend nationally next year.
""Implementation has been slow ... E10 has been done only in some regions for now,"" the source said, asking not to be named because he lacked authorization to speak publicly about the issue.
The Chinese government would most likely seek to balance ethanol use with local production, refraining from pushing for an immediate implementation of the E10 that would necessarily spur imports, the COFCO source added.
""There is also pressure from oil companies, so I don't think it is going to happen,"" he said, referring to implementation next year.
The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) estimates that China will be far from reaching the national E10 target next year. It projects the country's total ethanol blending volume to gasoline in 2020 at between 3% and 3.5%.
If Chinese imports were to jump, Brazil would be in a good position in relation to the United States, the world's biggest ethanol producer. China slapped a 25% additional tariff on imports of U.S. ethanol this year as part of the trade war between the world's two largest economies."
994,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 29, 2019 11:31PM ET</span>",China banking regulator uncovers rule violations among smaller lenders,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China's banking and insurance regulator said on Friday a series of small and medium-sized bank inspections has uncovered a number of rule violations and misdemeanors.
The China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (CBIRC) said lenders were found to have contravened rules by lending to undercapitalised real estate projects, to over-indebted local government platforms, and to firms found to have seriously violated environmental laws.
As the economy slows, smaller banks are under increasing pressure after new asset management rules cut off a major source of income and as bad debt from struggling borrowers mount.
The CBIRC also pointed out a number of corporate governance issues including shareholders who have financed their shareholding via trust loans, the long-term absence of senior personnel, lack of performance appraisals for management and lack of concern about related-party transactions.
Three regional banks have been bailed out by Beijing this year. Large state banks acted as ""white-knights"" in some cases of sector consolidation, with ICBC announcing a 30 billion yuan investment for a 10.82% stake in the troubled Bank of Jinzhou.
The CBIRC also said risk management and internal control requirements are often not in place. Some lenders have little internal accountability and there were cases where signatures and seals were falsified on guarantees.
Loan funds were also found to have been misappropriated, for example money was lent to a trading company, but then used by an entity other than the borrower.
In some cases, high consultancy fees were charged even though no real services were provided, the CBIRC said.
""All local small and medium-sized banking institutions should pay attention to strengthening internal control, plugging loopholes, and improving mechanisms,"" the CBIRC added."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A federal judge in Manhattan on Thursday partially dismissed a lawsuit by investors in  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Co that accused the company of concealing $24 billion in insurance liabilities and using fraudulent accounting to prop up its power business.
Judge Jesse Furman, however, granted the shareholders permission to amend their complaint. The class-action lawsuit, originally filed in November 2017, consolidates six cases that sought to hold GE and its senior leaders accountable for falling profits in recent years. 
The suit, brought by more than a dozen U.S. and foreign pension plans, retirement funds and investors in GE, names the company and former Chief Executive Officers Jeff Immelt, John Flannery and other senior executives. It alleges they understated GE's exposure to long-term care insurance risks and risks related to its long-term service agreements with customers that bought power plant equipment from GE. 
""Plaintiffs may be able to allege additional facts regarding the individual defendants' knowledge, or conscious disregard of, GE's actuarial issues (with respect to its LTC portfolio) and the trends and risks it should have disclosed (with respect to its LTSAs) that would permit plaintiffs to clear the scienter bar,"" Furman wrote in his ruling, referring to the legal term for knowledge of wrongdoing.
In an emailed statement, a GE spokesman said, ""We are pleased the court dismissed the vast majority of the claims against GE, including the securities fraud allegations related to the company's legacy insurance business. We intend to vigorously defend the rest of the case and continue to believe the claims are without merit.""
The ruling comes just after Madoff whistleblower Harry Markopolos said GE's insurance business was under-funded relative to what it owed for long-term care policies.
A subsequent Fitch Ratings report ranked GE's insurance units as among the most exposed to long-term care and least prepared to pay such claims. 
The suit alleges that starting in early 2013, Immelt and other top GE executives repeatedly misled investors by saying GE had sold its insurance business even though GE remained liable for money-losing long-term care policies. 
The insurance policies, which cover the cost of assisted-living or nursing care for the elderly, have turned out to require much greater payouts from insurers than was expected when the policies were written in the 1990s and early 2000s. 
In January 2018, GE took a surprise $6.2 billion after-tax charge and began setting aside $15 billion to cover future claims from about 300,000 long-term care policies.

GE has denied using fraudulent accounting to hide falling sales and profits at its power unit. It said investors were victims of ""business setbacks and forecasting misses"" that GE disclosed at the time. GE also said the suit failed to point out specific information it should have provided ""that a reasonable investor would need to avoid being misled.""

996,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 29, 2019 10:58PM ET</span>",Buffett-Backed BYD Close to Battery Supply Deal With Audi,"(Bloomberg) -- Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) AG’s Audi luxury-car brand is in talks to add China’s BYD Co. as a supplier of batteries used in its premium electric vehicles, according to people familiar with the matter.
Negotiations with Warren Buffett-backed BYD, China’s top electric-car manufacturer and No. 2 auto-battery supplier, are at an advanced stage, the people said, asking not to be identified because the talks are private. BYD is also in discussions with other automakers about battery-supply deals, one of the people said. There’s no guarantee that an agreement with Audi will be reached, the people said.
Carmakers are seeking to diversify supplies of critical components as the rollout of electric models gains traction. VW plans to deliver 22 million fully electric vehicles worldwide by 2028, with more than half of them built in China, where BYD makes batteries. Audi currently uses battery cells from Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Ltd. for its Q2L e-tron sport utility vehicle sold in China.
In May, concerns over a battery supply deal with Samsung (KS:005930) SDI Co. unraveling in Europe pushed VW to rework details after pledged supplies shrank to less than 5 gigawatt hours from just over 20 gigawatt hours. For BYD, teaming up with a global luxury brand like Audi will help it take on bigger rival CATL. The two Chinese companies are emerging as challengers to Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc. suppliers Panasonic Corp. and LG Chem Ltd.
Shares of BYD rose as much as 3.7% and were up 3.4% at 9:59 a.m. in Hong Kong. The stock is down 21% this year. Volkswagen rose 1.1% in late trading Thursday, boosting gains this year to about 5%.
BYD’s batteries would be used to equip upscale cars made on the Premium Platform Electric architecture jointly developed by Audi and Porsche, said one of the people. The first models are slated to hit the market around 2021.
An Audi spokeswoman said the company is in talks with several manufacturers, and no decision has been made. BYD didn’t have any information to disclose at this point, according to a spokeswoman.
Audi and BYD had also explored options for deeper ties including a development joint venture or acquiring a stake in the Chinese supplier’s battery unit, the people said. It’s unclear how far those talks progressed, they said.
Spin-Off Plans
BYD plans to list its battery business by the end of 2022 to help raise funds for expansion as the industry shifts to electric cars, Chairman Wang Chuanfu said in December.
BYD has so far been focusing on making batteries for its own car assembly only, becoming China’s top maker of so-called new energy vehicles while missing out on taking a bigger slice of growing battery demand in the world’s largest electric-vehicle market. The value of batteries used in electric cars, electric buses and related energy storage is set to balloon about 10 times to a potential $500 billion by 2050, according to Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.
BYD also cooperates with Audi rival  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn) on making the Denza brand of electric vehicles.

Japan’s Nikkei 225 gained 0.9% by 10:15 PM ET (04:15 GMT). Government data showed the country’s industrial output rose 1.3% in July, outperforming the expected 0.3% gain.
Manufacturers surveyed by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry expect output to rise 1.3% in August and decline 1.6% in September, the data showed.
China’s Shanghai Composite and the Shenzhen Component climbed 0.5% and 0.6% respectively.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index traded 0.7% higher. South Korea’s KOSPI jumped 1.7%. 
Down under, Australia’s ASX 200 was up 1.3%.
The gains of Asian equities came following comments from Gao Feng, spokesman for China's Foreign Ministry, that Beijing would not retaliate for now against U.S. President Donald Trump's latest tariff moves. 
Gao also said China is “willing to negotiate and collaborate in order to solve this problem with calm attitude,” although the spokesman said Beijing wants to see some of those rolled back so that the two sides can negotiate in September. 
“China has plenty of means for counter measures, but under the current situation, the question that should be discussed right now is about removing the U.S.′ new tariffs on $550 billion Chinese goods to prevent escalation of the trade war,” Gao said.
Meanwhile, Trump said the U.S. and China are set to have trade talks later in the day “at a different level.”
“There’s a talk scheduled for today at a different level,” Trump said in an interview with Fox News Radio without elaborating on what “a different level” means.
The Wall Street closed higher amid the positive trade news. The S&P 500 rose 1.27%. The Dow Jones industrials climbed 1.25%, and the Nasdaq Composite added 1.48%. The Nasdaq 100 index, dominated by big tech stocks, added 1.51%."
999,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 29, 2019 10:13PM ET</span>",Waymo urges U.S. to 'promptly' remove barriers to self-driving cars,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Waymo, the self-driving car unit of Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc, on Thursday urged the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) to ""promptly"" remove regulatory barriers for cars without steering wheels and brake pedals.
Automakers must currently meet nearly 75 auto safety standards for self-driving cars, many of them written under the assumption that a licensed driver is in command of the vehicle using traditional controls.
NHTSA has been grappling for more than three years with how to address those requirements, while filings from major companies this week shed light on complex issues surrounding testing, acquiring and evaluating fully self-driving vehicles.
""NHTSA should move promptly to remove barriers while ensuring safety,"" Waymo said in a letter posted on Thursday after the auto safety agency sought public comment in May ""on the removal of unnecessary regulatory barriers to the safe introduction of automated driving systems.""
NHTSA should first work on addressing those safety standards that assume a human is behind the wheel before revising rules to address alternative seating configurations, Waymo said.
That will ""enable the timely deployment"" of vehicles without manual controls, Waymo added.
General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) in its comments said ""it is imperative that NHTSA continue to drive this critical dialogue with a sense of urgency so that the necessary regulatory evolution keeps pace with advancing technology.""
 Lyft  Inc (NASDAQ:LYFT) and Honda Motor Co told the agency in separate comments that it could recognize self-driving cars as a separate vehicle class to address the rules written assuming humans would be behind the wheel.
NHTSA does not plan to begin writing rules on seating positions until March 2020. That involves revising crashworthiness standards to address occupants faced to the rear or side in fully self-driving cars. New seating positions ""are not vital to the development or deployment of AVs,"" Waymo said, referring to autonomous vehicles.
Comments filed by automakers suggest it could take the agency until at least 2025 to complete a comprehensive rewrite of various safety standards.
NHTSA is also grappling with how and where to test self-driving cars to assure they are safe. The agency is considering whether to use simulations or external remote controls in testing. Many automakers plan remote controls to pilot autonomous vehicles through factories or onto trucks.
In January 2017, GM sought an exemption from NHTSA to deploy fully automated vehicles without steering wheels before the end of 2019. Last month, GM’s self-driving unit, Cruise, said it was delaying the commercial deployment of the cars past its target.
Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co and GM both told the safety agency that its self-driving vehicles will initially not be able to respond to human commands like ""drive up onto a car hauler"" or drive forward 10 feet (3 meters) and stop.
Ford said its self-driving car ""will be responsible for deciding when, where and how it is appropriate to drive... We do not foresee interfaces beyond a method of giving the vehicle a destination.""
New York City told NHTSA it should ensure self-driving cars meet baseline performance requirements including ""a high rate of accurate pedestrian and cyclist detection from all angles, the application of the brakes in time to stop the vehicle prior to a collision, and the maintenance of safe and legal speeds.""
That testing would help weed out ""under-developed systems,"" the city added."
1000,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 29, 2019 08:51PM ET</span>",Nominee to head U.S. export controls bureau gives up acting duties: Commerce Department,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump's nominee to oversee the U.S. Commerce Department's bureau that controls exports of technology to foreign firms, such as China's Huawei Technologies Co Ltd, said on Thursday she is renouncing her acting duties but has not withdrawn from the confirmation process. 
Neither the official, Nazak Nikakhtar, nor the Commerce Department offered a reason for her decision. Nikakhtar was nominated to head the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) by Trump in April and has been awaiting confirmation.
Nikakhtar has decided to return to her role as Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Industry and Analysis ""where she will continue to advance the Administration's trade and national security policy priorities,"" a spokesman said. Nikakhtar was confirmed by the Senate for that position in March last year.
Reached by Reuters, Nikakhtar said she was ""really proud to have served,"" and committed to serving Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross any way possible. ""I am going to speak with leadership about how I can best serve the country,"" she added. 
The BIS is at the forefront of Trump's trade war with China, which the United States started last year in part over allegations Chinese companies steal American intellectual property. 
After the U.S. government accused Huawei, the world's top telecoms equipment maker, of stealing U.S. technology and violating U.S. sanctions on Iran, BIS put Huawei on a so-called entity list, effectively banning firms from selling U.S. goods to the Chinese company without special licenses. 
Since then, companies have submitted over 130 applications for licenses to sell U.S. goods to Huawei, but have received no responses, even though Trump promised to allow some sales to the firm at a meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping in June. 
BIS was also leading the process of setting rules to make it harder to export certain critical technologies deemed essential to national security to countries such as China. Many companies are waiting impatiently for rule proposals to find out what technologies will be affected by the regulations. 
A person familiar with the matter said internal divisions at the bureau may have hamstrung Nikakhtar, known as a China hawk, as she sought to define policies. 
Nikakhtar is seen as aggressively prioritizing national security concerns, which often put her at odds with industry, according to a person familiar with the matter. However, another person credited her with being very open to accepting meetings with the private sector.
Her nomination faced headwinds early on. At a U.S. Senate banking committee hearing in June, two senators said they could not advance her confirmation until seeing a report she contributed to that said auto imports threatened U.S. national security.

1001,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 29, 2019 06:34PM ET</span>",Credit Suisse to shift focus from branches to digital banking,"By John Miller
ZURICH (Reuters) -  Credit Suisse  (S:CSGN) said on Monday it would invest hundreds of millions of francs in digital services and other parts of its Swiss division by the end of 2021 and said it no longer needed a bigger branch network in its home market than its rivals.
Banks across Europe have been closing branches and cutting tens of thousands of jobs as customers go online and banks seek to save on their bricks-and-mortar costs.
""The achievement of long-term success will not depend on having the biggest branch network in the future,"" Thomas Gottstein, head of Credit Suisse's Swiss Universal Bank (SUB) unit, said without elaborating on any branch closures.
""Instead, having the best digital offering – combined with access to advice from any location and the best service quality – will be the deciding factor,"" he said in a statement.
The Zurich-based bank is creating a new business area, called Direct Banking, for retail and commercial clients, starting on Sept. 1 while carving out its Swiss investment banking operations into a separately managed unit.
In total, investments ""in the high three-digit million range"" through 2021 will include boosting the Swiss unit's digital offering, hiring client advisers, marketing and sponsorships, Credit Suisse said.
Beyond digital services, Credit Suisse said it planned increased telephone advisory services and ""the provision of personal advice in the regional network of branches"".
More details about the new branch concept would be provided in the first half of 2020, the bank said.
Credit Suisse's new Direct Banking would have about 1 million retail clients, 60,000 commercial clients, and more than 500 employees and would be run by Mario Crameri, Credit Suisse said.
YOUTH, RETAIL LAG
""Credit Suisse's market share tends to be lower in Swiss retail banking and among young bank clients than in most other client segments,"" it said.
""Against this backdrop, Credit Suisse has decided to adjust the business model of its Swiss division and to make substantial investments.""
The bank said it also planned investment in digital solutions for areas with a strong advisory focus, particularly for wealthy clients, entrepreneurs, companies and institutional clients.
The Swiss division is sticking with financial targets communicated at Credit Suisse's 2018 investor day: above-market growth in revenue and client business volume, a cost-to-income ratio of less than 60%, further profitable growth over the medium term and a return on regulatory capital of more than 18%.
The Swiss Universal Bank, which in 2015 was targeted for a now-shelved partial IPO as Credit Suisse sought to raise cash, has increased its pre-tax income from to 2.2 billion Swiss francs ($2.26 billion) in 2018, from 1.6 billion francs, over the last three years.
The cost/income ratio improved from 68% to 58% over the period, Credit Suisse said."

The Dow's 326-point gain was its best one-day point gain since Aug. 13. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq point gains were their best since Aug. 16.
Gainers overwhelmingly outnumbered losers, with industrial, tech, financial and energy stocks enjoying the biggest gains.
  Caterpillar   (NYSE:CAT), exposed to global trade currents, rose 2.5% to lead the Dow. Dollar General (NYSE:DG) was the top S&P 500 stock.   Best Buy   (NYSE:BBY) was among the laggards. The electronics retailer buys many of its electronic products from China and many of these will be subject to new tariffs starting Sept. 1.
The rally was prompted by comments from China's Foreign Ministry that Beijing would not retaliate for now against President Donald Trump's latest tariff moves. But the spokesman also said China also wants to see some of those rolled back so that the two sides can negotiate in September. 
The comments set off rallies in many markets around the world and pushed the Dow up as many as 373 points before some profit-taking set in. 
Economic data released Thursday, especially a revised estimate of gross domestic product, proved benign. The Commerce Department put growth at an annualized 2% in the quarter, down slightly from the first estimate but in line with expectations.
Chip stocks were among the biggest gainers on the day, with Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Micron (NASDAQ:MU) and Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) among the top gainers in the category. Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), up nearly 2.4%, was the third-best Dow performer after Caterpillar and   Home Depot   (NYSE:HD). The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index rose 2.25%.
Energy stocks climbed as West Texas Intermediate crude reached $56.91 a barrel, up 1.67%. Brent closed at $60.49 a barrel. The Philadelphia Oil Service Sector Index rose nearly 2%. 
Interest rates were higher, with the 10-Year yield rising to 1.506% from Wednesday's 1.468%. The yield was still lower than the yield on the 2-Year note, but the 10-2 Year Treasury Yield Spread narrowed to 2.76 basis points from Wednesday's 3.22 basis points. 
Dollar General (NYSE:DG), PVH (NYSE:PVH), National Oilwell Varco (NYSE:NOV) and Marathon Petroleum (NYSE:MPC) were among the S&P 500 leaders. PVH owns many popular brands including Van Heusen, Tommy Hilfiger, Calvin Klein, IZOD and Arrow.
Tax-preparation company H&R Block (NYSE:HRB),  Best Buy  (NYSE:BBY), tobacco company   Altria Group   (NYSE:MO) and MarketAxess Holdings (NASDAQ:MKTX) were the S&P 500 laggards. MarketAxess operates an electronic financial trading platform.

1006,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 29, 2019 04:49PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top-3 Things to Watch,"Investing.com - Here are the top-3 things that could rock markets tomorrow. 
1. Inflation, Consumer Spending and Manufacturing on the Way
The update on the health of the U.S. consumer and the pace of consumer prices due 8:30 AM ET (12:30 GMT) on Friday will help traders assess whether the slowdown in the global economy is beginning to seep into the U.S. economy. 
The Fed’s preferred inflation measure, core PCE price index, which calculates spending minus volatile food and energy costs, is expected to rise to 0.3% in July from the prior month, but remain unchanged at 1.6% from a year earlier.
Personal income for July is forecast to have slowed to a rise of 0.3% from 0.4% in the prior month, while personal spending is expected to have increased to a rise of 0.5% from 0.3%.
The Chicago purchasing managers index (PMI), which gives investors insight into manufacturing in the Midwest, will come out at 9:45 AM ET.
The August PMI is expected to rise to 48.1, according to economists.
Consumer sentiment data is also expected to be closely watched.
The final measure of the University of Michigan’s August consumer sentiment index, due at 10:00 AM ET is forecast to show a reading of 92.1, unchanged from the preliminary number.
2. Oil Rig Count Rolls In
Traders will look to the latest rig count data due Friday for clues on crude production activity after U.S. production surged to a record 12.5 million barrels a day last week. 
Data last week showed the number of oil rigs operating in the U.S. fell by 16 to 754.
The weekly rig count is an important barometer for the drilling industry and serves as a proxy for oil production and oil services demand.
Oil prices are set to end the week higher as signs of tightening global supplies help ease fears of slowing oil demand growth, driven by the weakness in the global economy. Sentiment on oil has also been bolstered by optimism on trade as China said it may cooperate, boosting hopes of a meeting between the U.S. and China next month. 
3.  Campbell Soup  Earnings Due
 Campbell Soup  (NYSE:CPB) reports earnings before the opening bell Friday amid a shakeup at the top, as the food company on Thursday hired Mick Beekhuizen to succeed Anthony DiSilvestro as chief financial officer. 
The move comes as Chief Executive Mark Clouse, who took up the reins earlier this year, bolsters his team to revive some of the food company's brands amid stiff competition from upstart brands that draw on the health and wellness trend appreciated by younger consumers. 
Campbell Soup is expected to report earnings of 41 cents a share on revenue of $1.98 billion. "

1008,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 29, 2019 04:10PM ET</span>","Amazon fires scorch Bolsonaro's reputation abroad, but not in Brazil","By Anthony Boadle
BRASILIA (Reuters) - President Jair Bolsonaro has drawn sharp criticism on the international stage from European leaders and environmental groups for his handling of wildfires raging in the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), but at home few Brazilians are angered by his reluctant response.
Many of his fellow citizens share his aversion to what they see as foreign meddling in how to strike a balance between protecting and developing the Amazon rainforest. The vast region is regarded at home as a key national asset but is seen globally as a crucial bulwark against climate change.
However, opinions in Brazil may change if trade sanctions or boycotts start to weigh on an already weak economy, politicians and analysts say.
A surge this year in the number of fires in the Amazon has sparked international outrage and protests in front of Brazilian embassies.
Environmentalists claim most of the fires were illegally set by land speculators and ranchers seeking to expand pastures in the Amazon who feel emboldened by Bolsonaro's criticism of excessive environmental protections.
Bolsonaro has denied the fires were deliberate and repeatedly told European countries in particular not to interfere. He has threatened to turn down international aid, although Brazil needs the funds and equipment to fight the fires, and feuded with French President Emmanuel Macron.
An opinion poll this week found almost 60 percent of Brazilians considered Bolsonaro's government to have done a great, good, or normal job, indicating they were still willing to give the president the benefit of the doubt, said Leonardo Barreto, head of Brasilia-based consultancy Capital Politico.
""Ironically, this crisis may have increased Bolsonaro's popularity because of his nationalism grounded in the threat of losing control over the Amazon to foreigners,"" said Welber Barral, a lobbyist and former Brazilian foreign trade secretary.
Many Brazilians, from across the political spectrum, believe the Amazon contains untold riches in minerals that are coveted by other nations, from gold to niobium, a strategic metal used in satellites.
This belief, long a central doctrine of Brazil's armed forces, feeds suspicion of any role by foreigners in the Amazon, even non-governmental organizations that work to protect the environment and indigenous tribes.
However, former army captain Bolsonaro was criticized by politicians in Congress - even by some allies - for taking too long to act in tackling the fires and wasting time on the slinging match with Macron, who accused him of lying about the rate of deforestation in the Amazon.
""The government has delayed taking important decisions,"" Governor Helder Barbalho of the state of Pará, site of the most intense fires, and a member of the centrist Brazilian Democratic Movement party, told Reuters.
ECONOMIC FEARS
The biggest problem facing Bolsonaro, who took the reins in January, was the lack of any solid recovery in Brazil's economy on his watch, Barbalho said. Now the Amazon crisis had damaged Brazil's image abroad and that could ricochet on the economy, he warned.
""If international markets close for Brazilian farm products we will be in an even more serious economic scenario,"" he said.
Some countries have already threatened sanctions because of Bolsonaro's environmental polices and consumers may decide to boycott Brazilian beef.
""That would directly affect one of Bolsonaro's main - if not the main - electoral base, the agribusiness industry, which has backed him from the word go,"" political risk analyst Barreto said.
Barreto said Bolsonaro's administration will stand or fall on its economic record, especially an unpopular overhaul of the pension system that is winding its way through Congress.
The global outcry over the fires in the Amazon and Bolsonaro's environmental policies could also start to influence investors.
In the first sign of a backlash, the U.S. parent company of apparel and shoe brands Timberland, Vans and the North Face said on Thursday it will no longer buy leather from Brazil due to concerns about the environment.
Companies in Europe and elsewhere could be pressed by their shareholders to stop investing in environmentally sensitive regions of Brazil, in sectors such as mining, Barral said.
That would not help growth prospects for Brazil, which economists have reduced to just 0.8% for this year.
Former center left agriculture minister Katia Abreu sees a danger of countries that are competitors in the farm sector ganging up on Brazil, using the environmental issue as a pretext.
That would turn more Brazilians against Bolsonaro, she told Reuters.
""But Bolsonaro doesn't take advice from anyone on how to avoid crises,"" she said. ""He doesn't listen. He is unpredictable."""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury yields rose on Thursday with 30-year yields climbing from record lows, as hopes on U.S.-China trade talks and a dismal seven-year note auction cooled the recent torrid rally in the bond market.
Part of the yield curve remained inverted with a negative gap between two-year and 10-year yields at -2.9 basis points, little changed on the day. The yield curve has inverted before every U.S. recession in the past 50 years.
China's commerce ministry on Thursday said Beijing and Washington are discussing the next round of face-to-face trade talks scheduled for September.
""The most important thing at the moment is to create necessary conditions for both sides to continue negotiations,"" commerce ministry spokesman Gao Feng said during a weekly briefing, adding that China was lodging ""solemn representation"" with the United States.
China's latest message reduced safe-haven bids for Treasuries, German Bunds and major sovereign debt, analysts and investors said.
""If you take away the trade war, you take away the worries,"" said Brent Schutte, chief investment strategist with Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management Co.
In late trading, U.S. benchmark 10-year Treasury note yields (US10YT=RR) rose to 1.5063%, up 3.8 basis points from Wednesday. The yield on 30-year bonds (US30YT=RR) rose to 1.9727%, rallying from record lows of 1.905% touched on Wednesday.
Investors are awaiting what the Federal Reserve would do to counter the risks from a possibly protracted trade fight between the world's two biggest economies.
Interest rates futures implied traders have positioned for the Fed to lower rates at its upcoming policy meeting in September, following a rate cut in July, which was its first since 2008, according to CME Group's FedWatch program.
Treasury yields extended their rise following a $32 billion auction of seven-year debt, in which the overall bidding was its weakest since this security debuted more than a decade ago. The seven-year note sale marked a disappointing end to this week's $113 billion in fixed-rate government debt supply.
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told Bloomberg News late on Wednesday that the possibility of issuing ultra-long U.S. bonds is ""under very serious consideration"" by the Trump administration.
J.P. Morgan released a survey on Thursday that showed more investors are open to owning an ultra-long bond than two years ago, but a majority still prefer the Treasury to introduce a 20-year security over one that matures beyond 30 years."

Shares of  Altria Group  Inc (N:MO), which has a 35% stake in Juul, fell 4.1% to $43.96 in afternoon trading after the Wall Street Journal earlier reported the probe.
Juul has already come under scrutiny for its marketing efforts, including its use of social media influencers to promote its vaping devices, which have become extremely popular among teens.
The U.S. House of Representatives and some state attorneys general have also launched separate investigations into the company's promotion practices. Last year, the Food and Drug Administration conducted a surprise inspection at Juul's San Francisco headquarter and seized documents.
""Without commenting on any specific investigation, we fully cooperate and are transparent with any government agency or regulator who have interest in our category,"" a Juul spokesman said.
The company ""never marketed to youth"" but has changed its advertising to feature adult smokers aged 35 and above, and has stopped promoting on social media, the spokesman added. 
A May 2019 court filing from lawyers, who filed a proposed class action lawsuit against Juul on behalf of customers, disclosed that an unnamed government agency was investigating the company's marketing practices.
The group is seeking refunds for purchases of Juul products and an injunction to prevent the company from continuing to market to children and non-smokers. 
The filing said that while Juul had not turned over documents about its marketing practices to the lawyers, it ""has presumably already gathered and produced many of these documents in response to investigatory demands from the FDA, (REDACTED), and Attorneys General for California, Massachusetts, and Washington, as well as the Los Angeles District Attorney.""
FTC investigators are examining Juul's involvement in deceptive marketing, including by targeting minors or using influencers, and is also determining whether to seek monetary damages, according to the Wall Street Journal report. 
Altria did not immediately respond to Reuters' request for comment, while an FTC spokesman declined to comment.
Shares of Philip Morris International Inc (N:PM), which is in talks to merge with Altria, fell 2.7%.

Separately on Thursday, Juul said it was giving over $100 million of incentives to retailers to install new age-verification systems at stores, part of efforts to curb sales of e-cigarettes to minors.

1012,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 29, 2019 03:50PM ET</span>",U.S. charges reverse mortgage lender Live Well's ex-CEO with fraud,"By Jonathan Stempel
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. government on Thursday charged the founder of reverse mortgage provider Live Well Financial Inc with engineering a $140 million fraud by inflating the value of its bonds, in what he called a ""self-generating money machine.""
Michael Hild, 44, who was also Live Well's chief executive, generated more than $24 million of compensation tied to the scheme, which ran from September 2015 to May 2019, according to federal prosecutors in Manhattan who announced the charges.
Founded in 2005, Live Well said it would close on May 3 and terminate its employees, after authorities said the Richmond, Virginia-based company failed to repay lenders sitting on tens of millions of dollars of losses.
Live Well later took a $141 million writedown, and was put into Chapter 7 bankruptcy on July 1 following a request by three lenders: affiliates of  Flagstar Bancorp Inc  (N:FBC), Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Ltd (SS:601398) and South Korea's Mirae Asset Financial Corp.
Hild, who lives in Richmond, was charged with bank fraud, securities fraud, wire fraud and two conspiracy counts. Three counts carry maximum 30-year prison terms.
Live Well's former Chief Financial Officer Eric Rohr and head trader Darren Stumberger pleaded guilty to related charges and are cooperating.
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filed civil charges against the men and Live Well. Rohr and Stumberger partially settled.
Steven Feldman, a lawyer for Hild, declined to provide immediate comment. Lawyers for Rohr and Stumberger declined to comment. Live Well's lawyer was not immediately available for comment.
Reverse mortgages allow homeowners aged 62 or older to borrow against equity in their homes. Loan balances become due when the homeowners die, move or sell their homes.
Hild was accused of scheming to persuade an outside pricing service to stop publishing its own valuations of Live Well bonds, and instead to use Live Well's preferred valuations.
Prosecutors said this induced Live Well's lenders to extend more credit than its bonds could support, allowing its reported portfolio to swell tenfold to $500 million in 16 months.
Authorities said Live Well held an emergency meeting in January 2017 after a nosy lender asked to spot-check bond valuations, threatening to expose the scheme.
The SEC said Rohr suggested that Hild find a dealer who was ""willing to be slimy"" by corroborating wrong valuations.
""I feel like I'm about to throw up right now,"" Rohr allegedly said.
The next day, Hild said he feared that allowing a spot-check risked letting ""the genie out of the bottle,"" the SEC said.
The criminal case against Hild is U.S. v Hild, U.S. District Court, Southern (NYSE:SO) District of New York, No. 19-cr-00602."
1013,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 29, 2019 03:49PM ET</span>","As U.S. Treasuries sizzle, some bond investors brace for possible sell-off","By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss
NEW YORK (Reuters) - While there seems to be no end on the horizon to this year's dramatic rally in U.S. Treasuries that has collapsed yields more than a full percentage point, conditions are ripening for a reversal that could disrupt the market.
Some signals analysts track point to higher yields, although no one knows when the shift is coming.
The consensus view is that U.S. yields could go even lower. A protracted U.S.-China trade war, a darkening global economic outlook, and the Federal Reserve's monetary easing stance are bullish for Treasury prices.
Still, yields this low are getting harder to justify, some analysts said. Some investors have hedged against a possible U.S. rate rise by reducing holdings of long-term bonds and grabbing other fixed-income products such as private debt and structured credit.
""This feels to me like dot-com level cockiness on this side of the bond bulls,"" said Kevin Muir, market strategist at East West Investment Management in Toronto.
""I would just caution as somebody who has been through a lot of market shifts, that as we get more and more euphoric and more volatile, the chances of a big move, snapping back and hurting people in a big way will increase dramatically,"" he added.
U.S. 10-year and 30-year yields have both dropped more than 100 basis points since January, on track for their steepest fall in eight and five years. Ten-year yields are currently at 1.521% (US10YT=RR) , while 30-year yields (US30YT=RR) are at 1.988% after hitting a record low on Wednesday of 1.905%.
GRAPHIC: Biggest monthly fall in 30-year USTs since 2011 - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/MARKETS-MILESTONES-FACTBOX/0H001QESK83N/eikon.png
Evercore ISI technical analyst Rich Ross said the 10-year yield is the most oversold since 1998.
The one-month Merrill Lynch MOVE index (MERMOVE1M), which tracks the one-month implied volatility for the 10-year Treasury yield, hit a more than three-year peak of 91.822 last week, suggesting expectations of major price moves.
Investors had wondered about the prospect of U.S. bond yields below zero as negative yields have become a mainstay in Europe and Japan. The United States is expected to avoid this fate, but some have not ruled it out.
Longer dated U.S. Treasuries have led the rally, prompting a yield curve inversion, where shorter-dated borrowing costs are higher than longer ones. An inversion is widely viewed as a signal of a looming recession.
The premium on 2-year yields above 10-year yields narrowed a bit on Thursday to -1.40 basis points.
""It's very difficult to look at the curve right now and see much attraction in Treasuries here,"" said Bill Merz, director of fixed income at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Minneapolis, who helps oversee $170 billion in assets.
U.S. Bank is maintaining its neutral core bond allocations and is slightly underweight duration, Merz said.
Duration, expressed in years, measures how much a bond's price will move when the Federal Reserve changes interest rates. The longer the duration, the higher the bond's sensitivity to interest rate changes.
Merz qualified though that the slight underweight duration was ""primarily to make room for a structured credit allocation that we see as more attractive than traditional core bonds, so non-agency mortgages, and other structured credit products.""
TREASURY RALLY TURNING?
Stan Shipley, fixed income strategist at Evercore ISI in New York said it was tough to call a major turning point in 10-year Treasury yields, but several indicators suggest the rally in bonds is nearing an end.
Evercore ISI's economic diffusion index (EDI) which tends to lead the 10-year yield by around six months has turned higher, Shipley said, adding that other tactical indicators also point to higher rates.
A J.P. Morgan survey showed last week that bond investors have already scaled back bullish bets on U.S. longer-dated government debt.
GRAPHIC: Investors positions in longer-dated US Treasuries - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/TREASURIES-JPMORGAN/0H001PBDZ4X5/eikon.png
Aside from technical factors, a fiscal response to economic recession fears, such as more spending and tax cuts from the U.S. government, would likely push Treasury yields higher as well.
Financing additional government spending would require selling more Treasuries, which should lift yields. More importantly, analysts said increased fiscal spending signals a commitment to boosting economic growth.
Jonas Goltermann, senior markets economist, at Capital Economics in London, said the sharp rise in bond yields in November 2016 after U.S. President Donald Trump was elected and in early 2018 after Congress passed his tax cuts shows the impact of fiscal policy on bond markets can be substantial.
East West's Muir said he was surprised governments around the world are not spending enough to take advantage of record low yields.
""But I am confident that governments are going to figure out how to spend and it would be the biggest surprise that the bond market has ever seen."""

Citigroup issued a double upgrade on Jabil to buy from sell, sending shares 8% higher. 
For years, investors have upped bets on shares of companies in Apple's supply chain on expectations that increased iPhone shipments would underpin growth in component providers like Jabil. 
That investment narrative, however, came under scrutiny recently as Apple's iPhones lost some of their luster, with the company ceding ground to both Samsung (KS:005930) and Huawei, slipping to third position in smartphone market share. 
But Citi said it believes the worst is over for Apple and has taken a liking to Jabil, for whom Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) accounts for about 28% of total revenue. 
Traders will not have to wait too long to see whether iPhones are back in demand as Apple is reportedly set to unveil its latest slate of phones at an event on Sept. 10. 
Apple's push into wearables, meanwhile, is also a tailwind for Jabil given its strength in the segment, Citi added. 
Still, there are headwinds that are unlikely to fall to the wayside just yet.
In its third-quarter report, Jabil warned of continued weakness in semi-capital equipment, automotive and telecom services.
Jabil is up nearly 14% year to date and has a consensus price target of $32.14, according to estimates compiled by Investing.com. "

1019,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 29, 2019 02:46PM ET</span>",More investors warm to a U.S. ultra-long bond: survey,"By Richard Leong
(Reuters) - More investors are warming to the idea of owning a U.S. Treasury bond that matures beyond 30 years, but most still prefer the U.S. Treasury Department to roll out a 20-year security over an ultra-long issue, a J.P. Morgan survey showed on Thursday.
Thirty-nine percent of the nearly 130 respondents said they would buy an ultra-long Treasury bond. This was more than the 19% who said they would do so two years ago, according to the survey. The respondents include banks, asset managers and hedge funds.
Half of those surveyed said they prefer a 20-year Treasury security in the latest survey. That figure was significantly lower than 73% two years earlier.
The rest of investors said they favor an ultra-long zero-coupon security, slightly higher than in the prior survey.
Earlier this month, the U.S. Treasury Department asked for updates from market participants about the possibility of selling ultra-long bonds.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told Bloomberg News on Wednesday the possibility of issuing ultra-long U.S. bonds is ""under very serious consideration"" by the Trump administration.
On Wednesday, the yields on U.S. 30-year Treasury bonds, the government's longest-dated debt security, fell to record lows on a global scramble for bonds due to fears about a recession and U.S.-China trade tensions.
The yields on the 30-year, or ""long,"" bond (US30YT=RR), are now lower than the Fed's target range on policy rates, which are currently at 2.00%-2.25%.
For some fund managers, the idea of the government locking in long-term rates at all-time lows is appealing.
Britain, Japan and a number of European countries issue sovereign bonds that mature in 50 years.
""It makes total sense. For the government, it should issue as much as it can,"" said Carl Kaufman, managing director of fixed income at Osterweis Capital Management in San Francisco.
Wall Street on the other hand remained cautious about the federal government borrowing beyond 30 years from the bond market.
""Overall, we do not see a strong case to issue an ultra-long maturity, for a number of reasons,"" J.P. Morgan strategists said in a note on the results of the survey.
Investors in the survey said an ultra bond would likely cannibalize demand for existing long-dated Treasuries, the strategists said.
Demand from private pension funds will likely dwindle, while foreign appetite at 30-year bond auctions has waned in recent years, they noted.
Moreover, introduction of an ultra-long bond does not fit with the Treasury's current objectives because it would raise its borrowing costs ""without meaningfully reducing risk,"" they said.

1020,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 29, 2019 02:45PM ET</span>",Trillions Are in Motion as Traders Eye Paradigm Shift for Rates,"(Bloomberg) -- It’s been just four weeks since the first U.S. rate cut in more than a decade, but a mass migration is already underway in financial markets.
The Federal Reserve’s pivot to easier monetary policy has spurred the busiest August for the $4 trillion U.S. market for exchange-traded funds since the government-debt downgrade of August 2011, as everyone from mega-traders to mom-and-pop investors adjusts to a new paradigm.
No wonder, for there’s a lot to take in. Beyond the U.S. central bank’s bold step, there’s an escalating trade war with China, a record-beating stockpile of negative-yielding bonds, and persistent signals of recession lurking within the yield curve. Together, they’re fueling a multi-trillion-dollar rethink of strategies heading into year-end.
“Investors had been anticipating a rate cut, and now that it’s happened, they’re trying to determine if the risk is even greater than they perhaps previously perceived,” said Todd Rosenbluth, director of ETF research at CFRA Research. “Given the strong interest in safe-haven assets and strong trading volume in August, we could see an acceleration.”
Debt Rotation
Almost $2.2 trillion of ETF shares have changed hands this month, typically a sleepy period for markets, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
Nowhere was this more evident than within the bond market, where ETF trading topped its record for the month. Floating-rate notes, which tend to do well when rates rise, are out of fashion, and inflation-protected securities -- which hedge against price gains, a byproduct of lower rates -- are back in vogue.
ETFs focused on floating-rate notes have hemorrhaged a record $1.4 billion since the Fed reduced rates, and outflows could deepen if traders’ bets for further cuts by year-end come to fruition.
“The forecast for the payout on those is not good,” David Donabedian, chief investment officer of CIBC Private Wealth Management, said of these notes. “Certainly a part of that is the realization that rates are going down, not up.”
The Fed meets again in mid-September and futures pricing shows traders see rates declining 50 basis points by Dec. 31, with a 36% chance of an additional quarter-point cut.
Trading patterns suggest that much of the money that’s fled floating-rate notes has gone into ETFs owning inflation-protected securities, which gained a record $1.5 billion this month.
Policy makers viewed their July cut as, in part, insurance against too-low inflation, minutes from the central bank’s meeting show. Price gains have stubbornly remained below the Fed’s 2% target for years, despite strong employment and consumer-spending data, but further rate cuts could turn the tables.
“It’s not surprising,” Candice Bangsund, a portfolio manager at Fiera Capital, which is betting on TIPS, said of the ETF influx. “It ties into that theory that inflation expectations are much too low. There’s very little regard for the fact that inflation is actually moving higher.”
But investors still risk jumping the gun. While traders have boosted expectations for further rate cuts, Fed Chair Jerome Powell described lower rates as a “mid-cycle adjustment” and rejected the idea of a return of looser monetary policy unless the economy weakens drastically.
Meanwhile, the Fed’s preferred measure of inflation showed signs of rebounding in June. Data for July is slated to be released on Friday and at least some investors are betting it could continue its upward trend, mitigating the need for further rate cuts. Floating-rate notes now look cheap to Pacific Investment Management Co., which believes that the market’s expectations for further easing are too high.
Still, with the rotation underway, it could take more than one piece of economic data to roll back the tide of cash that’s on the move.
“What happens when we get these volatile markets like we’ve seen, you see investors moving, you see fund flows moving,” said Chris Gaffney, president of world markets at TIAA, who says investors are being more defensive. “Could they change? Certainly. If we get really good news on the trade front, it could change.”"

Most members of the bank’s board “highlighted the persistence of an environment of uncertainty that has affected private investment, and which has stemmed from the public policy decisions taken by the new administration,” according to minutes from the Aug. 15 decision to cut the key interest rate. They also mentioned concerns over insecurity and corruption.
The minutes elaborated on initial comments published by the monetary authority in announcing the rate decision and which were already rebuked by the president -- Lopez Obrador said on Aug. 16 that the central bank was overreaching in its comments on the nation’s economic policy.
While the post-decision statement was more vague, only alluding to the administration’s policies, in the minutes most board members cited a perception of weak public finances. Some even warned about the weakness of investor confidence in Mexico, with one highlighting impacts from cancellation of an airport for Mexico City, suspension of private partnerships for Petroleos Mexicanos and a dispute with natural gas pipeline firms.
Pointing Fingers
Policy makers were “pretty clear and direct in pointing the finger to current and prospective macro policy as a source of risk and uncertainty in the eyes of investors and of the central bank board as well,” said Alberto Ramos, chief Latin America economist at  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS).
One board member underlined that government revenue has fallen short of expectations and that the situation could worsen in the next three years based on plans to support Pemex.
The minutes also showed that deputy governor Javier Guzman dissented from the decision to cut interest rates, voting to leave them on hold. He cited worries about persistent high core inflation, the lack of information about the government’s 2020 budget plan and the potential that the reduction would surprise investors and create a negative reaction.
Analysts in a survey published by  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C).’s Mexico unit last week expect the five-member board to cut interest rates again in its next scheduled decision on Sept. 26."

A video was released on social media this week showing president of the board Roberto Kriete telling employees that the airline was ""broke."" The airline said the video was obtained illegally and denied that it was in a bankruptcy or insolvency process.
""We do not want to enter Chapter 11 (bankruptcy), obviously the negotiations on which we have focused seek to avoid having to ask for help from the courts or help from regulators and simply to reach deals that... allow us to pay everyone who we owe,"" chief executive Anko van der Werff told journalists.
Avianca is asking investors to exchange $550 million in bonds that come due in 2020, part of a plan to change its capital structure.
The airline will reorganize debt, cut investment in some parts of its business and look to better serve its clients, van der Werff said.
It will also increase its number of seats without increasing its fleet, he said.

1026,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 29, 2019 01:52PM ET</span>",BNP Paribas plans bid for Deutsche Bank's equity derivatives,"By Matt Scuffham
NEW YORK (Reuters) - French lender  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) plans to bid for Deutsche Bank's (DE:DBKGn) equity derivatives book and is hopeful it can beat off rival bidders to secure a deal in the next few weeks, according to sources familiar with the matter.
 Deutsche Bank  is selling the portfolio as part of a restructuring that will see it exit equities trading and other unwanted businesses and shed 18,000 staff globally. Chief Executive Officer Christian Sewing is hoping the plan will turn around the bank, whose shares hit a record low this month.
Deutsche Bank plans to auction its equity derivatives portfolio next month having received significant expressions of interest from banks, private equity firms and hedge funds, the sources told Reuters. It may sell the book in separate tranches rather than in its entirety, they said.
BNP is already close to taking control of Deutsche Bank's prime brokerage business, which serves hedge fund clients. A preliminary deal was struck in July which is expected to be formalized early next month. Any equity derivatives deal would be separate from that transaction, the sources said.
BNP and Deutsche Bank declined to comment.
Reuters reported last month that Deutsche Bank's derivatives exposure is tying up capital that could have generated income of 500 million euros a year. Reuters also reported the bank has set aside over 1 billion euros to cover the cost of offloading derivatives moved to its so-called ""bad bank,"" or capital restructuring unit to be wound down or sold.
The restructuring has seen the bank hive off 288 billion euros of assets into the bad bank. Equities, including equity derivatives, accounted for around 170 billion euros of those assets. Fixed-income assets, including long-dated interest rate and credit derivatives, accounted for 79 billion euros.
The equity derivatives are short-dated and expected to attract a lot of interest from buyers, meaning Deutsche Bank may not have to take a discount to offload them. The bank's longer-dated interest rate and credit derivatives are expected to be much harder to sell, as they require high levels of capital to be held against them, and could require deep writedowns, sources familiar with the situation said.
BNP expressed its interest in Deutsche Bank's equity derivatives business earlier this year but the German lender decided against entering into exclusive talks having also received interest from other parties, sources told Reuters.
Deutsche Bank is under pressure to complete the prime brokerage deal quickly or risk losing clients. Barclay (L:BARC) is looking to take on a $20 billion portion of the $200 billion business, sources told Reuters last month.
Deutsche Bank plans to close the prime brokerage deal in the first half of September and to begin the auction of its equity derivatives book shortly afterwards, the sources said. The deals are expected to take months to complete as buyers take over individual client accounts."

Sao Paulo state is the heart of Brazil's auto industry, although its relevance has been in decline in recent years as other states have offered more generous tax incentives.
Doria's governorship, however, has been marked by a strong push to attract and retain manufacturing plants in Sao Paulo. Earlier this year, he introduced a tax plan for automakers granting them a 25% reduction in value added taxes as long as they invested at least 1 billion reais and created 400 new jobs.
Sao Paulo state said in a statement that Volkswagen would create 1,000 jobs and invest in its Sao Bernardo do Campo plant, in a city that is the historic center of Brazil's auto industry.
The incentive plan was created when General Motors (NYSE:GM), Brazil's market leader, hinted late last year that it might close or severely reduce its operations in the state as it warned of heavy losses.
Other automakers have also made moves in their Sao Paulo operations.
Ford announced this year that it would close its Sao Bernardo do Campo plant, its oldest in the country, which would cost almost 3,000 jobs.
Doria responded by offering to find a buyer for the plant, and while domestic automaker CAOA entered negotiations with Ford regarding a possible purchase, no formal announcement has been made."

(Reuters) -  Best Buy  Co Inc (N:BBY) blamed planned U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports and uncertainty about future consumer behavior for a lower annual sales forecast, becoming the latest company to air concerns about President Donald Trump's trade war with Beijing. 
Best Buy's shares, which have lost more than 10% of their value so far this month, fell 9% to $62.80 as the consumer electronics retailer's same-store sales outlook fell short of analysts' expectations even as it lifted its earnings forecast.
Strong July retail sales showed U.S. consumer demand so far has remained resilient to signs of a cooling economy and an escalating trade war between Washington and Beijing. 
However, investors are increasingly focusing on how the sector will cope with new rounds of tariffs with retailers, such as Macy's Inc (N:M) and Abercrombie & Fitch Co (N:ANF) warning that their profits this year would take a hit.
Best Buy said it expected its full-year same-store sales to rise 0.7% to 1.7%, narrowing the range from a prior forecast of 0.5% to 2.5% and below the 2% growth target analysts had expected.
Last Friday, Trump said tariffs would rise to 15% from 10% on $300 billion worth of Chinese imports, targeting some of Best Buy's best selling goods including smart watches, flat panel TVs, mobile phones and video game consoles. The levies are set to go into effect in two phases on Sept. 1. and Dec. 15.
Newly appointed Chief Executive Office Corie Barry said the company was still working out if and how to raise prices on products as it works with suppliers on new sourcing strategies.
""It's the most difficult place for us to make projections... We don't exactly have a precedent for the quantity of moving pieces that we have in place right now,"" Barry told analysts.
Barry estimated all the proposed and implemented tariffs affected about 60% of Best Buy's cost of goods sold but said the company was working on lowering that to 40% next year. 
Best Buy's overall same-store sales rose 1.6% in the second quarter ended Aug. 3, missing analysts estimates of a 2.15% increase, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Earnings per share excluding one-off items came at $1.08, beating analysts' estimates of 99 cents per share and prompted Best Buy to raise its annual adjusted profit forecast to $5.60 to $5.75 per share from previous $5.45 to $5.65$.
The company's profit benefited from better expense control and more subscribers signing up for its high-margin services such as ""Geek Squad"", which provides general tech support and advice on setting up smart homes.
Revenue in the reported quarter rose 1.7% to $9.54 billion, a touch below expectations of $9.56 billion, largely due to lower demand for video game consoles, which the company said would also pressure its sales for the rest of the year.
The lower demand is largely due to consumers postponing their purchases in anticipation of the next versions of Sony Corp's (T:6758) PlayStation and Microsoft Corp's (O:MSFT) Xbox. 

Best Buy also forecast third quarter same-store sales below estimates, but said tariffs would not have much of an impact on the quarter.

ANKARA/ISTANBUL (Reuters) - German carmaker Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) is holding talks with officials in Ankara over Turkey's vehicle tax regime as it seeks to conclude a 1-billion euro investment to build a production plant in Turkey, two sources said on Thursday.
The company said last month that no decision had yet been reached on the location of a new multi-brand plant, but the sources familiar with the talks said Volkswagen is positive about investing in Turkey and was close to taking the step. 
The sources did not say what assurances Volkswagen is seeking on vehicle tax. Car purchases in Turkey incur a special consumption tax which ranges from 45% to 60% for engines up to 1.6 liters and rises to 100%-110% for engines up to 2 liters.
""Volkswagen is largely ready to invest a billion euros into Turkey,"" one of the sources said. 
""The only standing request VW has is on taxation on the vehicle market,"" the source added, saying Turkey was trying to find a formula that would address Volkswagen concerns without putting existing car producers at a disadvantage.
Major producers such as  Fiat  (MI:FCHA),  Renault  (PA:RENA), Ford (N:F), Hyundai (KS:005380) and Toyota (T:7203) produced more than 1.3 million motor vehicles in Turkey last year.
The steep Turkish taxes on larger cars limit most buyers and local producers to smaller engine sizes. Cars with engines of less than 1.6 liters made up 96% of Turkey's new car market in 2018.
Volkswagen had also been looking at the new production plant in Bulgaria, but the sources said it was now close to finalizing the deal with Turkey.
""There is only one issue left and that is the taxation system,"" the second source said, adding that the differences could be overcome. 

""Even if it is not implemented immediately, a pledge for change (in the tax system) at a specific date in the future would be enough. They are planning to convey this request to the Turkish president. A final decision will materialize shortly.""

1039,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 29, 2019 12:34PM ET</span>",Sterling investors hold their nerve despite Johnson's gambit,"By Saikat Chatterjee
LONDON (Reuters) - Prime Minister Boris Johnson's most audacious bid yet to take Britain out of the European Union on Oct. 31 with or without a deal on their future relations is not panicking money managers yet.
Some even sense an opportunity, believing the British currency is cheap, and the government's gambit could make clinching a new withdrawal deal with the EU more likely.
Johnson on Wednesday received royal approval to suspend parliament for a month from mid-September to mid-October. Critics have called it an outrageous move aimed at limiting the amount of time lawmakers have to pass legislation to stop a no-deal Brexit before Oct. 31.
For his part, Johnson insisted there would still be plenty of time for parliamentarians to debate Brexit.
Sterling dropped more than 1% early on Wednesday, bruised by the prospect of an economically damaging withdrawal from the EU, and another showdown between the government and parliament that may end in a general election. Markets rushed to price in more volatility for the British exchange rate between now and November.
But this week's move southwards was orderly - and at around $1.22 sterling is still quite a way from the 2-1/2-year low of $1.2015 reached earlier this month. The pound is also nearly 3% above its 2019 low against the euro (EURGBP=D3).
That's partly because many traders have already slashed their sterling exposure, leaving fewer people in desperate need to offload. Some also argue that negative news is largely priced in - notwithstanding the wild swings likely over the next two months, the pound should eventually be worth much more, they say.
""Even if we fall into a no-deal Brexit, we could see a downside of about 5% from current levels but the upside could be more, especially if officials respond with a stimulus package to cushion the economic impact,"" said Ugo Lancioni, managing director of global fixed income and currency management at Neuberger Berman.
Lancioni, who manages about $41 billion of assets, is positioned positively on the pound, citing the relatively low value of the currency compared with other developed market peers.
Against a historical average dating back nearly 30 years, the pound is about 17% undervalued on a trade-weighted basis, according to a Bank of England index .
Versus its developed G10 peers, the British currency is the fourth-cheapest on a 10-year average based on trade-weighted indexes adjusted for inflation.
(Graphic: G10 FX Valuations link: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/12/5383/5333/fx%20valuations.png)
DEAL MORE LIKELY?
Valuations aren't the only factor encouraging some money managers to buy sterling.
Despite this week's events, most big banks still see a no-deal Brexit on Oct. 31 as an unlikely outcome. Some such as JP Morgan assess that probability at 35% - up from a previous 25% - while others such as Nomura and  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) put it between 40%-50%.
 Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) said on Thursday it had kept its no-deal Brexit probability at 35%.
Ulrich Leuchtmann, Commerzbank's head of FX and commodity research, said parliament's suspension gave Johnson the scope to travel to the EU summit on Oct. 17 and 18 with a credible no-deal threat.
He could then force the EU to accept changes to their agreement, which it has so far refused to countenance, according to Leutchmann.
Then there is positioning. Weekly data suggests that short bets against the British currency - essentially a punt on prices falling in the near future - swelled to a near 2-1/2 year high of $7.79 billion this month.
But last week sterling enjoyed some buying interest, forcing those betting against the pound to dump some of their bets to avoid further losses, according to Robert Turner, a quant trader at the Royal Bank of Canada.
Turner said investment flows on the RBC platform were broadly neutral on Wednesday, echoing Leuchtmann's view that Johnson's move could make an EU deal more likely.
(Graphic: RBC Positions link: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/12/5384/5334/RBC.png)
Betting odds on a no-deal exit in 2019 have crept up but at 43%, according to the Betfair Exchange, they also do not yet point to widespread panic among punters.
WHAT OPTIONS
Against this more positive pound outlook is the argument that a no-deal Brexit is far from priced in. Some have forecast sterling to slump toward parity against the euro - and possibly even the dollar - should Britain crash out in two months time.
Banks' far from pessimistic view would also support the idea that any downside for UK assets has much further to run.
With so much political uncertainty bunched into the final two weeks of October, investors have taken to buying implied volatility on the pound rather than outright shorting it, which runs the risk of a last-minute deal sending it racing up.
Implied volatility on the pound, or expected price swings, over the next three months jumped to its highest level since December on Thursday, and trades at more than double the average of its G10 FX peers for similar maturities.
""We are fairly neutral on gilts and the pound, as even though we may be in the final stages of the Brexit negotiations, the risk is too binary,"" said Geraldine Sundstorm, a portfolio manager at PIMCO."

LONDON (Reuters) - Italy's stocks are ending August on a high after the formation of a new coalition government, while Britain's equity market is heading for one of its worst months since before it voted to leave the European Union more than three years ago.
Milan's blue-chip index (FTMIB) hit its highest since Aug. 1 on Thursday as investors welcomed news that two former feuding parties, the 5-Star Movement and opposition Democratic Party (PD), agreed to form a government.
The pact ended a chapter of the latest political drama to grip Italy's financial markets, averted a snap election and reduced the chances of another budget showdown with Brussels.
Hopes of a deal had spurred a 4% rise in the Milan index over the past week, making it the best performing major international bourse. It is on track for a 0.3% drop for the month.
That's significantly better than other major European bourses including Germany (GDAXI), France CAC (FCHI) and Spain (IBEX) as well as the S&P 500 (SPX) and Japan's Nikkei (N225).

As the latest political crisis in Rome ended, turmoil over Brexit deepened after Britain's Prime Minister Boris Johnson suspended parliament in a move seen as trying to thwart an attempt to prevent a no-deal departure from the EU.
London's blue-chip FTSE 100 (FTSE) index is on track to fall more than 5% this month for its worst monthly performance since August 2015. It has lagged all major global bourses.
The FTSE all-share index is set for a 4.7% drop this month, its second steepest monthly fall in four years.
The weak performance of the export-heavy FTSE 100 index is partly due to a recovery in sterling earlier in the month.
The majority of the FTSE 100 constituents make their money abroad which means they are relatively insulated from worries about lower consumer spending if there is a no-deal Brexit.
But a poll by Reuters showed that the outlook for the index has deteriorated since Johnson was appointed PM, suggesting the mood of unease is spreading to all UK assets."

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - U.S. aluminum producer Novelis is set to secure EU antitrust approval for its $2.6 billion bid for Aleris, people familiar with the matter said on Thursday.
Novelis, which is U.S.-based but owned by India's Hindalco Industries, has agreed to sell Aleris' Belgian plant, the people said, to address European Commission worries that the deal may reduce competition and lead to higher prices, hitting carmakers in particular.
The Commission, which is scheduled to decide on the case by Oct. 7, declined to comment. 
Novelis, the world leader in aluminum rolled products and aluminum recycling, is seeking to diversify into the aerospace, automotive, beverage can and construction industries.
It had sought to ease regulatory concerns by offering to increase capacity and add 80 new jobs at Aleris' Duffel plant but the competition enforcer forced the company to offer a far-reaching package of concessions, the people said.
""We are working constructively with the European Commission with the continued aim of closing the transaction by the end of this calendar year. We have no additional comment at this time,"" Novelis said.
The company had previously dismissed suggestions of price hikes resulting from the deal, saying that rival aluminum and steel producers would fill the gap and furthermore customers were prepared to take their business elsewhere if that were to happen.

The deal also requires approval from U.S. and Chinese watchdogs.

RIYADH (Reuters) - The Saudi Stock Exchange (Tadawul), the region's largest market, has completed the second and final phase of joining the MSCI Emerging Markets Index, raising its weight on the closely monitored index to 2.8 percent.
Its inclusion has generated foreign inflows worth billions of dollars since the start of the year and has helped the Saudi index make double-digit gains. Those benefits may fade as trading wanes amid gloomy economic conditions.
""Full inclusion in the MSCI Emerging Market Index represents an important milestone in advancing the Saudi capital market and further opening Tadawul to international investors,"" Khalid al-Hussan, Tadawul's chief executive, said in an exchange filing on Thursday.
From the start of 2019 through July 31, trading activity of foreign investors totaled $56 billion, representing 21% of total trading, according to the filing. Foreigners have been net buyers every month this year, sending the Saudi index (TASI) up nearly 20% at its peak in May.
Since then, however, geopolitical and trade tensions have reduced the index's year-to-date gains to 2.5%. Aanalysts expect the gains to dwindle.
""We expect oil prices to remain low, the Saudi economy to weaken further and global risk appetite to worsen, all of which will act as headwinds to equity prices,"" Capital Economics said in a research note.
FURTHER INFLOWS?
The Saudi kingdom opened its stock market to foreign investors in 2015. It has since introduced a raft of reforms to make it attractive to foreign investors and issuers and to expand its institutional investor base, as part of an ambitious plan to diversify the economy away from hydrocarbons.
Hussan had told Reuters in March that Saudi listed companies could see holdings by foreign investors rise to 10% when shares are fully included in MSCI and FTSE indices. Foreign ownership now is around 8%.
""International investors have already committed around $18 billion to Saudi equities so far this year, primarily from MSCI and FTSE trackers as well as Saudi dedicated ETFs,"" said Antoine Maurel, MENAT head of global markets at HSBC.
""We still except to see significant further inflows in the months ahead as foreign ownership of the Saudi stock market remains below its emerging market peers at less than 5%, excluding strategic holdings,"" he said.
MSCI upgraded Saudi Arabia from a ""Standalone Market"" to ""Emerging Market"" in June 2018. Saudi stocks were phased into the index in two tranches with a 50% inclusion factor for each, with the implementation of the first tranche taking place on May 28 and the second on August 28, 2019."

BEIJING/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Chinese banks will face pressure on earnings and asset quality in the second half of 2019 as interest rate reforms squeeze margins and a Chinese-U.S. trade war adds to economic uncertainty.
But results from three of the nation's top listed banks, all of which reported a first-half profit rise of nearly 5%, showed most pressure is being felt by smaller lenders, which have struggled with a liquidity crunch.
Three regional lenders have been bailed out by Beijing so far this year.
""The trade war causes uncertainty, and there is downward pressure on the economy,"" Gu Shu, the president of the world's largest commercial lender Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) (HK:1398) (SS:601398), told a news conference.
ICBC, the third of China's top five state-owned listed banks to post half-year results, reported a 4.7% rise in profit.
""We expect margin pressure in the second half of the year,"" said Ray Heung, senior vice president of the Financial Institutions Group at Moody's Investors Service.
He said a government drive to encourage banks to lower lending rates, including through its reform of the loan prime rate (LPR), was one factor putting pressure on earnings.
A second factor squeezing margins was that ""deposit competition won’t ease,"" Heung added.
ICBC's president said LPR reform would only have a limited impact on his bank's net interest income, adding that about 48% of ICBC's new loans in the first half referenced that rate.
But ICBC's results still showed it faced a squeeze, posting a fall in net interest margin, a key gauge of profitability, from 2.31% at the end of March to 2.29% at end of June.
Bank of Communications (BoCom) (SS:601328), which reported a 4.9% rise in first-half net profit earlier this week, said asset quality at commercial banks faced challenges.
China Construction Bank Corp (CCB) (SS:601939), another of the top fie, also reported a net profit rise of 4.9 percent for the first six months.
But both banks also reported a drop in net interest margin.
Smaller Chinese banks have been facing liquidity issues and mounting risks, with large state banks stepping in.
ICBC said it was making a 30 billion yuan investment to take a 10.82% stake in Bank of Jinzhou. CCB took charge of a take over of Baoshang Bank.
""The main challenge is how to maintain asset quality as the macro economy slows,"" CICC analyst Victor Wang said about the outlook for banks in the second half of the year.
By the end of the three months to June, the non-performing loan ratio for China's banking sector reached 1.81%, the highest since 2009, data from the China Insurance and Banking Regulatory Commission showed.
ICBC's non-performing loan (NPL) ratio was 1.48% at end of June compared with 1.51% at the end of March. BoCom and CCB also reported steady or falling NPL ratios."

Police are already investigating a group calling itself ""Rocks in the Gearbox"" after more than 40 luxury vehicles were vandalized at a car dealership in Kronberg on the outskirts of Frankfurt earlier this week, adding to a string of anti-auto protests.
Ahead of the car show, Germany's auto industry association the VDA has sought to defuse anti-car sentiment by inviting environmental activists from Greenpeace, Deutsche Umwelthilfe to a panel discussion in Berlin on September 5 along with executives from  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) and BMW (DE:BMWG) and the VDA, to debate the climate crisis and mobility of the future.
The Frankfurt show, known as the IAA, is due to take place from September 12 to 22.
""We are in close contact with the security authorities just as we are at every IAA. Entrance controls will be tightened, given that there may be spontaneous rioting at the show,"" VDA spokesman Eckehart Rotter told Reuters.
Environmental groups, including one called ""Sand in the Gearbox"", have appealed to the public to join protests in Frankfurt on September 14, prompting the VDA to warn car show visitors to expect longer queues at security checkpoints.
Police in Wiesbaden on Thursday said they were investigating ""Rocks in the Gearbox"" after the group claimed responsibility for vandalizing the Jaguar, Land Rover, and Aston Martin vehicles at the car dealership on Monday.
Windshields and windows, hoods and panels were smashed with metal objects and the two glass doors at the car dealership were broken, a spokesman for the Wiesbaden police told Reuters.
""They used hammers and crowbars and we are investigating a group claiming responsibility,"" the spokesman said.
""Rocks in the Gearbox"" released a statement on Monday saying: ""In two weeks Frankfurt will once again launch a propaganda show where the outmoded, climate and environment destroying transportation system is hyped.""
""We want to expose this show for what it really is: profits made on the backs of the poorest and at the expense of future generations ... We think it is time to throw rocks into the gearbox of capitalist and automotive profit logic.""
The statement called for more scrutiny of working conditions in related industries, including freight, cotton and rubber production as well as for people mining rare earths for electric car batteries and electronics.
Earlier in August, climate activists had occupied railway lines supplying Volkswagen's Wolfsburg factory, according to police in Wolfsburg-Helmstedt.
""We have opened a probe investigating potentially dangerous disruption of rail and shipping transportation,"" a police spokesman told Reuters."
1050,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 29, 2019 10:23AM ET</span>",Foxconn Sees India as a Manufacturing Alternative to China,"(Bloomberg) -- On a steamy summer morning, dozens of buses pull up outside a cluster of low-slung, blue buildings in the south Indian state of Andhra Pradesh. Women dressed in colorful salwar kameezes disembark, their dupatta body scarves billowing as they make their way past hibiscus bushes and posters proclaiming, “Our aim, no accident.”
The night shift at Foxconn Technology Group’s (TW:2354) mobile phone plant in Sri City is ending, and thousands of young women are punching out as others stream in to replace them. One of the arrivals is Jennifer Jayadas, a tall, slim 21-year-old who lives several miles away in a two-room hut with no running water.
After gobbling down a free breakfast of chapatti flatbreads with a potato-and-pea curry, she dons a checked white hat, apron-shirt, static-resistant footwear and tiny finger gloves. Then Jayadas takes her place at a testing station where she will spend the next eight hours making sure the volume, vibration and other phone features work properly. “Smartphones used to be all made in China,” she says. “Now, we make them here.”
 Foxconn, also known as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., opened its first India factory four years ago. It now operates two assembly plants, with plans to expand those and open two more. India has become an important manufacturing base as the Taipei-based company looks to diversify its operations beyond China
Succeeding in India has become all the more urgent since U.S. President Donald Trump launched a trade war last year and announced tariffs on thousands of products manufactured in China, including the gadgetry Foxconn makes for Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and others.
In late August, Trump ratcheted up the rhetoric—ordering American companies to start pulling out of China and citing a national security law as justification. He backed off two days later, but many companies have resigned themselves to an inevitable and costly rethinking of their global supply chains. 
“It’s a good business principle not to put all your eggs in a single basket,” says Josh Foulger, who runs Foxconn’s India operations. “We have to find viable and reliable alternatives. Obviously the alternative location has to be competitive. We can’t put a factory in Mexico for manufacturing mobiles. It might have worked 10 years ago, it just won't work today.”
Foulger, 48, grew up in Chennai and attended the University of Texas in Arlington, before returning to India in the mid-aughts to set up manufacturing for Nokia. He joined Foxconn four years ago to help founder Terry Gou establish assembly plants in India, now the world’s fastest-growing smartphone market.
Foxconn’s first India facility started in 2015 in Sri City, a special economic zone where goods can be imported and exported with limited red tape and foreign companies make everything from diapers to train carriages. Foxconn’s plant employs almost 15,000 workers—about 90% of them women—and assembles phones for various manufacturers, including local best-seller Xiaomi. In recent months, workers began testing and assembling Apple’s iPhone X, which will be sold in India first and eventually exported.
A second mobile phone factory opened in 2017 in Sriperumbudur, about two hours by road from the first facility. It employs 12,000 and is partially automated. “By 2023,” Foulger says, “both factories will be much larger and we’ll add two more locations.”
Foxconn currently ships parts in from China, but hopes one day to manufacture displays and printed circuit boards locally. Foulger is angling to capture a third of the domestic smartphone market and 10% of the global one (up from a 2.5% share today). Eventually, he plans to add other products, including Amazon Echo speakers, to the mix. “Until now, India has made for India,” he says. “Soon India will make for the world.”
 Seated in an office overlooking the hubbub of the Sriperumbudur plant, the strapping, bearded executive ticks off India’s pluses: labor costs that are half that of China’s, a vast pool of workers including talented engineers, a government eager to help.
They have a staunch partner in Prime Minister Narendra Modi who is under pressure to bring down a jobless rate that currently exceeds 6%. His government’s four-year-old “Make in India” policy seeks to turn the country into a manufacturing power by offering incentives to foreign companies to open factories. “The plan is to expand India’s $25 billion phone manufacturing to $400 billion by 2024,” says Pankaj Mahindroo, who heads the Indian Cellular & Electronics Assn. “A substantial portion of it will be for the export market.
There’s a long way to go: A mere 700,000 electronics manufacturing jobs have been created since Make in India started, according to Mahindroo’s industry group. Skilled workers such as industrial designers are in short supply, and there isn’t yet much of a supplier network providing crucial components such as batteries, semiconductors and processors. “India is not there yet,” says Anshul Gupta, a senior research director at Gartner India. “But things are beginning to fall in place. India can bolster its manufacturing capacity and help the world cut its reliance on China.”
 Foxconn was integral to China’s transformation into a manufacturing colossus, and Gou has told Modi that Foxconn could help India do the same. But it took China 30 years to get there. “China’s advantage was its massive labor pool that could produce quite cheaply, and they built on that by investing heavily in logistics and transportation,” says Andrew Polk, a founding partner with Trivium China, a Beijing-based research firm. “Even as their labor pool advantage is dissipating, they have invested in processes and systems so they can produce efficiently at scale and get the goods to the market.”
Catching up will require the Indian government and private sector to invest heavily in roads, rails, ports and other infrastructure. “When China did it, global supply chains were fragmented and there wasn’t another China,” Polk says. “India will not only have to get it right but they have to get it right in a way to better China, and trade wars can only help at the margins."" China also had the benefit of being able to grow without worrying too much about the environmental impact. With concern about climate change growing, “that’s not going to fly these days,” he says.
As a two-decade veteran of supply chains in India and elsewhere, Foulger is painfully aware of the challenges. “I can twirl my mustache and say, ‘India can replicate China,’” he says. “The reality is that we have shortcomings.” While the state government provided land, water and power connections for the Sriperumbudur facility, Foxconn, Dell, Flextronics and other companies banded together to build the industrial park for their factories. Even so, Foulger still needs to ferry in water for his thousands of workers because Chennai city and nearby areas have a severe water shortage. 
Foulger decided early on to recruit mostly women. Female factory workers are commonplace in China, but unusual in India, where rural women are typically consigned to unpaid household or farm work. Women in this region weren’t even allowed to work at night in factories until the local government and the courts intervened four years ago.
It was Foulger’s mother who planted the idea and persuaded him to give women the opportunity.  A teacher whose students often hailed from underprivileged backgrounds, she told him girls are curious, hard working and committed but family circumstances prevent them from going to college. Many are forced to start work early or are pushed into marriage and child rearing at a young age.
Foulger says that because most Indian manufacturers prefer to hire men, it was easy to hit his hiring targets. But he’s had to make accommodations. For instance, the air conditioning had to be turned up to 26 degrees because the woman have never experienced it before. A line manager brought up the issue of sanitary hygiene, and Foulger was initially hesitant. What would be the reaction in their villages, he wondered? Still, he listened and had sanitary pad dispensers installed in the washroom. Foulger also has to pay for extra security for his female recruits and provide buses and dormitory accommodation for those who live far from the factories. But he says it’s well worth the extra cost because “women work hard and appreciate the chances given to them.” 
Over the years, Foxconn has been criticized for grueling working conditions at its China factories. A string of suicides of young migrant workers earlier this decade shocked the world and prompted the company to create a help hotline, boost pay and install safety netting to discourage jumpers. In August, Foxconn fired two executives at a Chinese plant that assembles devices for Amazon after a labor group alleged it slashed wages and flouted laws to help deal with rising U.S. tariffs.
During visits to Foxconn’s two India factories, there was no visible sign of sweat-shop conditions. Workers there mostly complain about the monotony. From the minute they enter the shop floor to the end of an eight-hour shift, work repeats in a relentless cycle. The daily production target has to be met at all costs. Row upon row of women put together each phone part by part, inspecting each handset for visible defects. Shivaparvati Kallivettu, 24, spends her days testing the phone’s audio and examining batteries and SIM card trays, explaining that her main respite comes every morning in the factory canteen when she has breakfast with four close friends.
Most women take the jobs with specific goals in mind, such as sending their kids to better schools or clearing family debt. The pay hoists them over the poverty line. Jayadas gets about 9,000 rupees monthly ($130, which is about a third of the average Chinese factory wage), free bus rides and two wholesome meals. To help avoid tedium, the company teaches workers at least 10 skills in the testing, packing and assembly sections of the line so they can be rotated to different jobs. Still, many of the workers treat the job as a stop-gap. Recently, 400 women failed to show up for their daily shift. Managers discovered they were all taking the government’s teacher recruitment exam—a job that pays a third of what they make at Foxconn but provides less tangible compensations.
After her shift, Jayadas boards the bus, reaching her home a little before 4 p.m. She helps with the cooking, then fetches 12 buckets of water from a street tap for the family’s daily needs. Her father’s income repairing radios and DVD players is meager and erratic, and her entire paycheck goes to her parents. “First, the house has to be fixed,” Jayadas says gesturing toward the flimsy roof and decrepit walls. “Then, I want to save up for a beautician’s course.”"

Chinese officials confirmed on Thursday that they are working with the U.S. to schedule talks in September. Chinese ministry spokesperson Gao Feng said the discussions should focus on preventing escalations and resolving trade issues calmly. The comments reassured participants that there would be no further escalations of the conflict but did nothing to stop the latest in a series of U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods coming into force at the weekend.

Guess? jumped 21.7% after its quarterly profit came in above forecasts due to stronger sales and improved expense management, while Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) rose 1.5% and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) gained 2.1%. 

Elsewhere,  Best Buy  (NYSE:BBY) slumped 9% after it lowered its guidance for the rest of the year, citing the impact of higher tariffs on imported Chinese goods.

However, Oxford Economics analyst Gregory Daco warned that the strength of domestic consumption was ""unlikely to last.""

Unions representing cabin crew announced the plans to hold 10 days of strikes throughout September unless Ryanair changes plans to close several bases in the country. They will be joined by Spanish pilots for five days toward the end of the month.
The action follows strikes this month by unions in Britain and Portugal, the fist unrest the airline has faced in a year. The strikes however have so far caused nowhere near as much damage as last year after Ryanair ran a full schedule with few delays in both countries.
More widespread strikes over pay and conditions a year ago forced Ryanair to cancel hundreds of flights, hitting its profits in the busy summer months.
Ryanair has said it does not expect a second strike by some of its pilots in Britain to disrupt its UK schedule on Sept 2, 3 and 4, one day of which coincides with the action in Spain.
Ryanair canceled six of its 950 daily flights to and from Spain on Sept. 1 and eight on Sept. 2, and said that the closure of loss making winter bases in the Canary Islands - which it has blamed on delays in the delivery of the grounded Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX - will not be reversed because of ""pointless strikes"".
All affected customers have been notified and offered either a refund or the option to move their flights free of charge, it added. 

Spanish union USO (NYSE:USO) said its representatives will meet with Ryanair in Madrid to try to negotiate before the first day of strikes. Ryanair said it remained open to engaging with the unions.

1056,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 29, 2019 09:25AM ET</span>","EU extends tariffs on Chinese bicycles, fearing import flood","BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union has extended for a further five years anti-dumping duties on Chinese bicycles, the bloc said in its official journal on Thursday, after concluding that any lifting of measures would lead to a flood of imports.
Imported Chinese bicycles have been subject to anti-dumping duties since 1993, currently with an import tariff of up to 48.5%.
The extended duties are the latest in a series of EU measures against Chinese exports ranging from solar panels to steel, which have sparked strong words from Beijing.
The European Union also decided in January to impose duties of up to 79.3% on imports of Chinese electronic bicycles. Beijing said then that it was ""highly concerned"" by the move, which it said came despite market opposition, and that it would assess what steps to take.
The measures on regular bicycles have since 2013 also applied to those coming from Indonesia, Malaysia, Sri Lanka and Tunisia and since 2015 to those from Cambodia, Pakistan and the Philippines, albeit with some exemptions. The Commission says these imports are principally of Chinese bikes.
The tariffs do not apply to Taiwan's  Giant  (TW:9921), the world's largest bicycle manufacturer, which has facilities in Taiwan, China and the Netherlands. The company won a case at the European Court challenging EU anti-dumping duties in 2017.
EU consumers buy around 18 million bicycles per year, with just over 60% supplied by local manufacturers. Chinese imports make up only about 4% of the EU market, although the other countries' share was about 17%.
However, Chinese producers have spare capacity to make an extra 37 million bicycles, the EU's official journal said. Bicycles were also identified as a key industry in China's current five-year plan and its Made in China 2025 initiative.
Chinese officials did not respond immediately to a request for comment on Thursday.
This meant there was a ""strong likelihood"" Chinese producers would return to selling at artificially low prices and in high volumes if the anti-dumping measures were lifted. The EU also says input costs are distorted by state intervention.
The European Bicycle Manufacturers Association welcomed the extension, saying that without measures Chinese exporters would have driven EU producers out of their own market, as had already happened in the United States and Japan.
The industry in the European Union, made up of more than 900 generally smaller companies, has a turnover of 12 billion euros, employing 100,000 people directly and indirectly, the association said."

Shares of  Dollar General Corp  (N:DG) surged 8% and  Dollar Tree Inc  (O:DLTR) rose 4%, after the companies also beat Wall Street estimates for quarterly same-store sales.
U.S. President Donald Trump's additional tariffs on about $550 billion of Chinese imports announced last week is expected to hurt companies that rely on China for sourcing their products.
The two dollar stores, which source a large chunk of their merchandise from China, are already looking at other sources as the trade war shows no sign of relenting.
Dollar General said on Thursday it would be able to mitigate the impact of these tariffs, while its rival said it was working with suppliers to offset increased costs.
Dollar Tree also said it was able to tide over the previous round of tariffs through price concessions, canceled orders and a better assortment of products.
Dollar General forecast annual earnings of $6.36 per share to $6.51 per share, including the anticipated impact of increased tariffs. It had previously forecast $6.30 to $6.50.
Family Dollar-owner Dollar Tree predicted full-year profit between $4.90 per share and $5.11 per share, but said the forecast excluded the recent tariff hikes. Its previous range was $4.77 to $5.07.
The company also reported better-than-expected quarterly same store sales as its struggling Family Dollar chain posted its best growth since being acquired in 2015.
Hit by competition from big-box retailers like Walmart (N:WMT) and increased online shopping, the companies have been adding new products on shelves, self-checkout options and frozen food sections to improve shopping experience for customers.
Sales at Dollar General store open for more than an year rose 4% in the reported quarter, well above analysts' average estimate of a 2.43% increase, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
In the past few years, Dollar General has outperformed Dollar Tree as it has been able to stock shelves faster with fresh produce and frozen food at different price points, a key factor for low-income and budget shoppers."

1062,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 29, 2019 08:15AM ET</span>",GM Is Now Detroit’s Smallest Auto-Making Employer,"(Bloomberg) -- General Motors Co (NYSE:GM). now employs fewer union-represented American workers than its domestic rivals for the first time since the United Auto Workers started organizing Detroit’s carmakers eight decades ago.
GM’s 46,000 UAW workers trails Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co. by about 9,000 and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV by roughly 1,200, according to headcounts provided by the companies. Ford surpassed GM in 2014, and Fiat Chrysler overtook the No. 2 spot this year.
GM’s fall to third place is a dubious distinction for a company that’s been criticized by “America first” President Donald Trump. The company is also negotiating a new labor contract this year with UAW leaders who have vowed a take-no-prisoners approach to bargaining after an embarrassing corruption scandal.
Once the largest private-sector employer in the U.S., former GM President Charles Wilson famously said in the 1950s that “what was good for our country was good for General Motors, and vice versa.” But in recent decades, GM has downsized its domestic factory network and increased production in markets including China and Mexico.
“GM was historically the largest by far,” said Ron Harbour, senior vice president overseeing global automotive manufacturing for consultant Oliver Wyman. “But they cut a lot of plants in the U.S. during bankruptcy. They have a quarter of the plants they had in the 1970s.”
Blazer Blame
The issue of employment has dogged GM this year. The company has closed its car plant in Lordstown, Ohio, and stopped transmission output at a factory in Warren, Michigan, and two other U.S. plants are at risk of being shut down. The restructuring drew the ire of Trump and Democratic primary front-runner Joe Biden and is a focal point for the UAW in talks for a new four-year labor deal.
GM has also taken heat from the union for the company’s decision to build high-margin sport utility vehicles including the Chevrolet Blazer in Mexico. The start of production of that vehicle last year helped GM overtake Japan’s Nissan Motor Co. as Mexico’s top carmaker, according to Automotive News.
The union is expected to press for additional investment in U.S. plants and job security guarantees for American workers. During an event at GM’s plant in Orion, Michigan, in March, Terry Dittes, the vice president overseeing the union’s GM department, vowed to fight to keep jobs for workers in Lordstown and other factories marked for possible closure.
The Next American Car Recession Has Already Started
GM also has offered all of the 2,800 union workers at the plants at risk of closing a job in another U.S. factory. The company is aiming for a deal with the UAW that won’t destabilize its operations as global sales slow.
“GM’s focus during negotiations is to reach an agreement that builds a strong future for our employees and our business,” spokesman David Barnas said in an email.
Domestic Downsizing
At its peak forty years ago, GM employed 618,365 Americans, including 511,000 hourly workers. That was back when the automaker did much of its parts production in-house. That business became Delphi Corp., the forerunner of what is now Aptiv Plc and Delphi Technologies Plc. At the time of the spinoff in 1999, Delphi employed 43,150 UAW members -- nearly as many as GM does now.
The financial crisis a decade ago played a major role in downsizing the company. GM had so much excess production when the company filed for bankruptcy in 2009 that the automaker closed 14 plants and cut thousands of workers. In recent years, GM has trimmed more jobs at passenger-car plants as sales of sedans industrywide have cratered.
While GM is a shadow of what it once was in the U.S. in terms of payroll and vehicle production, since emerging from bankruptcy, the $23 billion that it’s invested in the U.S. is nearly five times the amount it has spent in Mexico. And the company’s 16,000 employee count in Mexico is roughly just one-third the size of its U.S. workforce.
Fiat Chrysler Rebound
In 2011, GM had 46,000 UAW workers, more than Ford’s 41,000 and Fiat Chrysler’s 23,150, according to data from the Ann Arbor, Michigan-based Center for Automotive Research.
Over the past eight years, Fiat Chrysler has increased market share and added U.S. production of Ram pickups and Jeep SUVs. The company’s headcount of 47,200 is more than double the number Chrysler employed when it was sold to Italy’s Fiat SpA in 2009. It’s poised to add 3,850 jobs at a new plant in Detroit scheduled to start production next year of a new three-row Jeep SUV.
“Fiat Chrysler has had an incredible rebound,” said Kristin Dziczek, an analyst with CAR. “GM has had to cut since then and they are now the number one exporter of vehicles to the U.S. from Mexico.”"
1063,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 29, 2019 08:14AM ET</span>",Apple to supply parts to independent repair shops for first time,"By Stephen Nellis
(Reuters) - Apple Inc (O:AAPL) said on Friday it will begin selling parts, tools and repair guides to independent shops to fix broken iPhones, a major change after years of lobbying against laws in some U.S. states that would have compelled it to do just that.
Apple said the program, which should help ease heavy demand on Apple and its authorized partners to fix millions of cracked screens and fried charging ports, will launch in the United States before being rolled out to other countries.
The back flip means that independent repair shops will be offered official parts for out-of-warranty repairs at the same price offered to authorized service providers, such as  Best Buy  Inc (N:BBY), which perform warranty work.
Ben Bajarin, an analyst with Creative Strategies, said the move could create more opportunities for Apple to sell services or accessories if it encourages iPhone owners to hand down used phones to friends and family.
""That helps them get the product more affordably into the hands of more customers and increases the base,"" Bajarin said. ""Every data point seems to say, if you get someone into the Apple ecosystem, they generally don't leave.""
Apple's iPhone sales have declined in the past two fiscal quarters, but sales of accessories such as its AirPods wireless headphones and the Apple Watch, along with paid services like Apple Music, have helped make up for some of the revenue falls.
Independent shops have long complained that the high purchase volumes required by Apple to become an authorized service provider priced them out of the repair market.
The tech giant had previously lobbied against ""right-to-repair"" bills to supply independent businesses in several U.S. states, including New York and California, citing concerns about maintaining a high service standard. It earlier this year allowed all U.S. Best Buy stores to handle warranty work.
However, the unofficial repair industry that sprang up, using mostly aftermarket parts supplied by third parties, was often unreliable.
Apple said it trialled the new repair program for a year with 20 businesses across North America, Europe and Asia. It did not give a timetable for the international launches.
The program will allow independent stores to set their own prices for repairs and also offer cheaper aftermarket parts. They will be required to return any collected broken Apple parts to the company for refurbishment or recycling.
The program will be free for shops to join, but they will be required to have an Apple-certified technician who has taken a free 40-hour training course and test provided by the company."

LONDON (Reuters) - Investors expect central banks will lavish stimulus on markets and spending will help prolong the rally across euro zone stock markets into a second year, according to a Reuters poll, even as worries grow about a recession and damage from Brexit. According to a survey of nearly 30 brokers, fund managers and analysts taken between Aug. 13-27, the euro zone blue-chip STOXX50 index (STOXX50E) will end the year at 3,400 points, up less than 1% from current levels.
But that would be a 13.3% rise for the year, its biggest annual gain since 2013, and would almost erase last year's heavy losses.
The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) is expected to close the year at 380, just 1.7% higher than Tuesday's close. That would mark a 12.5% rise for the year.
Participants see both indices gaining further ground next year, albeit at a slower pace than this year's double-digit percentage rise.
""Provided we get at least some de-escalation on the trade front, further help from the central banks and, potentially more important, further stimulus for the Chinese economy, we see decent upside for European equities,"" said Ulrich Stephan, chief investment officer for private and commercial clients at  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn).
He has pegged the STOXX50E at 3,370 by the end of this year and 3,530 by the end of 2020.
(Graphic: STOXX50E median link: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/12/5336/5288/stoxx50.png)
(Graphic: STOXX median link: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/12/5335/5287/STOXX.png)
Most of the headwinds that have battered European equities and pushed them to a discount against their U.S. counterparts - Brexit, global trade tensions, struggling auto industry and malaise across the banking sector due to negative rates - are priced into stock values, investors say.
That helps explain why the poll results haven't changed much over the course of this year - this is the third quarterly poll in a row that has shown a broad range of forecasts with only modest changes to median estimates.
The stasis in forecasts suggests investors are still struggling to assess the impact of the protracted trade battle between the world's two largest economies and worrying about a slowing economy while companies in the region suffer a corporate recession.
It also underscores the subdued optimism that has driven this year's rally, with investors buying equities in search for returns as bond yields fall into negative territory.
A big driver behind the gains has also been the European Central Bank's dovish about-turn earlier in the year. The ECB is expected to announce a stimulus package at its Sept. 12 policy meeting, making several rate cuts in the coming year and a fresh round of bond purchases, commonly known as quantitative easing.
In what would be a big deal for markets though, investors are also hoping Germany will also make a U-turn from its devotion to balanced budgets and embark on a spending spree to boost Europe's largest economy, rather than just relying on central bank policy.
UNDERPERFORMER
Still, it's not all rosy. Several investors said the euro zone will continue underperforming other developed markets given the potential for a recession and the gains are built on fragile ground.
""Sentiment isn't bearish enough and valuations aren't low enough to compensate for this mix of deteriorating outlook without lower prices,"" said Lars Kreckel, global equity strategist at Legal & General Investment Management.
""We do not expect it, but a much more-proactive-than-expected ECB is a potential upside risk for European equities.""
He pegs the STOXX 600 at 400 by the year-end and the STOXX50E at 3,500.
Paul O'Connor, head of multi-asset at Janus Henderson, advises investors to be ready for more volatility.
""Despite this year's broad-based bounce, the big picture remains one of an ageing bull market in equities.
""While buy-and-hold investing was the right approach when markets were trending strongly higher, the more turbulent market regime that we foresee will demand a greater emphasis on volatility management and dynamic asset allocation,"" he said.

(Reuters) - Shares in  Amigo  Holdings (L:AMGO) fell almost 50% to a record low on Thursday after the British subprime lender reported a rise in first-quarter impairments and costs and warned of slower annual growth in its loan book.
Amigo's shares were trading at 74.9 pence at 1046 GMT. In June last year the company had priced its shares at 275 pence in its stock market debut.
Amigo, which issues loans typically guaranteed by a borrower's family or friends, said a change in economic outlook and the potential for regulatory change had led it to take a more cautious approach to lending, with increased provisioning.
""We are therefore resetting expectations for the current financial year,"" the company said in a statement, with broadly flat loan book growth marking a significant departure from the previous low-teens net loans growth forecast for the medium-term.
Sub-prime lenders have seen rapid growth in Britain since the 2008 financial crisis as banks pared riskier lending. But the high interest rates charged for loans made to more vulnerable borrowers has fueled a public and political backlash, and put pressure on regulators to tighten supervision.
Lawmakers have called for an interest rate cap on all forms of credit, calling companies Amigo and  Provident Financial  (L:PFG) ""legal loan sharks"".
Bournemouth-based Amigo offers guaranteed loans of up to 10,000 pounds ($12,277) to borrowers with weak credit histories at an average annual percentage rate of 49.9%.
""In short, it is not a pretty update – with a material miss on impairments and operating costs as well as the new CEO, Hamish Paton, taking out the red pen to current year guidance,"" Goodbody analysts said. Paton was appointed in July.
""DARK DAYS AHEAD""
FTSE 250 lender Amigo reported an impairment to revenue ratio of 30.5% for the quarter ended June 30 from 25.4% a year earlier.
Amigo said the reasons for the increase in impairments included operational challenges within collections, the impact of a higher number of loan applications and more cautious accounting assumptions around the economy.
""The market was already worried about regulation becoming tighter for the guarantor loans market and today's update from Amigo makes matters even worse, suggesting it has some very dark days ahead,"" said Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell.
The cost to income ratio increased to 23.4%, hurt by a rise in investments and a provision for complaints.

TORONTO (Reuters) - Toronto's stock market will add to this year's gains over the coming months and notch a new record high in 2020, as potential Bank of Canada interest rate cuts bolster the outlook for real estate and metal mining companies, a Reuters poll found.
The Toronto market composite index (GSPTSE) has rallied 13% since the beginning of the year, after falling 11.6% in 2018.
The median forecast from an Aug. 13-28 survey of 24 portfolio managers and strategists polled was for the market to rise a further 2% from Tuesday's close to 16,500 by the end of the year. The index is then expected to move above the April 2019 high of 16,673 to reach 17,050 by the middle of 2020.
""We expect the Bank of Canada to join its global counterparts in lowering interest rates. This should bode well for the materials sector and stocks at large,"" said Arthur Salzer, chief executive officer of Northland Wealth Management.
The materials sector (GSPTTMT), which includes precious and base metals miners and fertilizer companies, has rallied about 25% this year as interest rate cuts by some major central banks, including the Federal Reserve, and geopolitical and economic uncertainty boosted the appeal of gold mining shares.
Money markets expect the Bank of Canada, which has worried about the risks trade wars pose to the global economy, to leave its benchmark interest rate on hold at next week's policy announcement but to ease by the end of the year.
Canada's 10-year yield (CA10YT=RR) fell this month to its lowest level since October 2016 at 1.083%.
A low interest rate environment over the coming one-to-two years is supportive of stocks and the housing market, said Bruce Latimer, a senior equity trader at Eight Capital.
Canada's housing market has showed signs of increased activity in recent months after a slowdown since the introduction of tighter mortgage rules at the start of 2018. The Toronto market's real estate index (GSPTTRE) has gained more than 18% this year.
Some other interest-rate sensitive components of the Toronto market, such as utilities, have also rallied in 2019. But the best performing sector has been technology, led by a surge of about 180% for commerce platform provider Shopify Inc (TO:SHOP).
Meanwhile, the heavily-weighted energy sector has been a laggard. The sector has fallen around 10% since the start of the year as oil prices fluctuated and after the province of Alberta, home to the third largest oil reserves in the world, imposed production quotas to relieve pipeline congestion and drain a glut of crude in storage.
The energy group is unlikely to be a star ""in the short-to-medium term"" without the pipeline infrastructure needed to move Canadian oil to international markets, said Dominique Lapointe, an economist at Laurentian Bank Securities.

1072,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 29, 2019 07:13AM ET</span>",Deutsche Bank Turns Into Government Headache as Economy Tanks,"(Bloomberg) -- Germany’s economic downturn is reigniting fears in the government of Angela Merkel about the future of its two largest lenders.
The government’s push for  Deutsche Bank  AG (DE:DBKGn) and  Commerzbank AG  (DE:CBKG) to hold merger talks created a massive backlash and eventually failed. Potential buyers are steering clear. Now, the administration is running out of options just when a looming recession fuels fears Germany’s banks might not be prepared to weather another crisis, according to two senior officials with direct knowledge of the government’s stance. The German Finance Ministry declined to comment.
""If the economy enters into a recession, the banks are the first to get hit,"" says Danyal Bayaz, a Green party lawmaker on the lower house finance committee. The government can’t do much at this stage other than to launch a fiscal stimulus program to mitigate the risk of a recession, he added.
The plan to merge Commerzbank and Deutsche Bank has been put on ice but not completely discarded, one person said. The idea would likely be resuscitated if either lender were to face a real threat to its future, the person said.
Deutsche Bank, which once had ambitions to become a global player, recently announced painful restructuring that aims to cut a fifth of its workforce and rip away a big chunk of its trading operations. Its renewed focus on German exporters comes just as the trade war between the U.S. and China heats up and President Donald Trump has German car makers in sights.
New banking troubles could have serious repercussions for domestic politics as well, with the governing parties at historic lows in the polls and under attack from populists and environmentalists. With Merkel’s coalition hanging by a thread, a handout to bankers would be a nightmare for the chancellor as she seeks to shore up her legacy.
Earlier this month, the government, which holds the largest stake in Commerzbank, sought outside advice about the strategy of the bank led by Chief Executive Officer Martin Zielke. Limiting the government’s room to maneuver is the fact that Finance Minister Olaf Scholz spent much of his political capital backing a failed merger attempt between the two earlier this year.
A restructuring plan presented by Deutsche Bank and expected from Commerzbank this fall may reduce costs in the long run but would do little to shield the banks should there be a sudden slump in activity, one of the people said. In fact, restructuring, which foresees costly compensation payments, slows down the planned buildup of a capital base at a time when investors are becoming increasingly risk averse, the official added.
Germany’s financial stability committee, made up of representatives from the central bank, the finance ministry, and the bank regulator, has repeatedly warned that the risk of recession for the German banking system shouldn’t be underestimated.
Bad Time
The slowdown comes at a particularly bad time for Commerzbank and Deutsche Bank. Both have been struggling for years to achieve a meaningful level of profitability. In the case of Deutsche Bank, the restructuring coincides with a thin capital cushion. A strong rise in credit defaults could force them to ratchet up their loan loss provisions and further deplete their capital.

Deutsche Bank’s Historic Revamp Hit by Sagging German EconomyCommerzbank Considers Cutting Up to 2,000 Additional JobsGermany Needs a Plan B After Deutsche Bank Deal CollapsesFor Scholz, who had been eager to create a national banking champion, the failed merger talks between Deutsche and Commerzbank, may have been particularly disappointing. In the end, it would have given the government a stake and say in Germany’s biggest lender and would have made it easier for it to intervene in the case of a crisis.
At the time, critics said the government was being too heavy-handed, that it wasn’t size but nimbleness that matter in banking.
Subsequent exploratory moves earlier this year for potential European mergers involving Deutsche Bank and UBS, as well as  ING Groep  (AS:INGA) NV, UniCredit SpA and Commerzbank didn’t prosper. Since then the appetite for M&A has subsided significantly, with banks shifting their medium term priorities amid the economic slowdown, another of the two officials said.
The fate of Germany’s major lenders mirrors a broader debate as to whether sufficient fixes have been made to the financial system since the 2008 crisis. The European Central Bank in March published research showing taxpayer money was now better protected than a decade ago but that despite ""significant improvement"" the ""regulatory work is not yet complete."" The Basel-based Financial Stability Board commissioned its own probe, which is being led by Bundesbank Vice-President Claudia Buch. It’s expected to be published in late 2020."
1073,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 29, 2019 07:10AM ET</span>",Boeing Fears 737 Worker Exodus in Tightest Job Market in Decades,"(Bloomberg) -- Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co. aims to clear its 737 Max for flight as soon as October. But the planemaker also is plotting how it would respond to a far worse scenario: a grounding that stretches months longer.
Complicating both efforts is the tightest U.S. labor market in half a century. With experienced mechanics and engineers increasingly difficult to hire, Boeing is pondering what once loomed as a last-ditch choice -- a temporary factory shutdown -- to preserve its workforce.
The Chicago-based company wants to avoid a potential unraveling of manufacturing expertise across a broad swath of North America as its recovers from the Max crisis. That’s the risk if large numbers of highly skilled workers from the 600 mostly U.S. companies building components for the jet were to move on to other jobs at a time of historically low unemployment.
The company is studying whether to pause Max manufacturing for a short, clearly defined period of time, according to people familiar with the matter. They figure that approach would conserve cash and be less likely to trigger widespread layoffs than imposing another factory slowdown.
Boeing officials won’t discuss the finer points of how they’d manage through a shutdown, including details like worker pay. But the idea is that coveted employees would prefer the certainty of a surgical shutdown to an open-ended period of slower production that could lead to layoffs.
“As we work to support the safe return of the 737 Max to commercial service, we continue to assess our production plans and invest in the health of our workforce, production system and supply chain,” according to a statement from Boeing. “The market for skilled workers is one of many considerations in our scenario planning processes. We’ll continue to support aerospace manufacturing jobs, which are vitally important to the U.S. and global economy.”
The 400,000 parts that go into each Max arrive in a tightly choreographed sequence timed, in some cases, down to the hour. But suppliers do regularly navigate stoppages telegraphed in advance, such as strikes, Boeing’s traditional year-end factory closure or rival Airbus SE’s August pause.
A temporary stoppage is just one of several options Boeing is scrutinizing while working to convince regulators, airlines and flight crews that its marquee jetliner is safe after two fatal plane crashes killed 346 people and sparked global outrage. Executives say the Max is on track to be approved to resume commercial flight early in the fourth quarter.
Ballooning Costs
If they’re wrong, the largest U.S. industrial company will eventually need to address its ballooning Max costs -- $8.3 billion so far. By the count of George Ferguson, an analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence, Boeing has stored about 200 newly built 737s across several Western states. It can’t deliver them due to a worldwide flying ban imposed after the second crash in March.
Boeing, meanwhile, is helping suppliers navigate a financially stressful situation. As it slowed work in its factory by 19% in April, the planemaker held production at pre-crash rates for its two largest partners: Spirit AeroSystems Holdings Inc., which makes 70% of the jet, and CFM International, a General Electric-Safran SA venture that makes its engines.
“Many suppliers have been shielded by Spirit and GE, but this is a finite lifeline,” said Stephen Perry, managing director with Janes Capital Partners, a boutique investment bank focused on aerospace and defense. “They can’t and won’t do it indefinitely. Same with Boeing.”
Suppliers were already struggling to retain their best mechanics and engineers. Aerospace workers are hard to come by with the Pentagon boosting defense spending and Airbus ramping up its new factory in Alabama.
Average hourly earnings for transportation-equipment employees have been rising faster than for other manufacturing workers, a key sign of high demand, according to Martha Gimbel, a New York-based economist who formerly worked at the Labor Department and Council of Economic Advisers.
Certain types of engineers might be unable to keep working on planes if they leave, “but their skills will always be in demand somewhere,” Gimbel said. The uncertainty over the Max may prompt some to simply switch industries.
Dennis Muilenburg, Boeing’s chief executive officer, first raised publicly the possibility of a temporary factory shutdown or production cut last month, given the uncertainty over the timing of the Max’s return. One key labor leader for Boeing workers, Jon Holden, said that while he hasn’t been looped into planning, he has repeatedly warned company leaders of the risks from slowing or stopping the 737 assembly lines in Renton, Washington, a suburb of Seattle.
“Any thoughts of a temporary shutdown would negatively impact our community and the entire country,” said Holden, president of IAM District 751, the machinists union that represents about 30,000 Boeing workers in the Seattle area. “This type of setback would hamstring Boeing’s ability to ramp production back up to previous levels and beyond.”
If Boeing were to announce an open-ended production halt when the Max’s return to service is still in question, “it’s a phenomenally negative signal to the supply chain,” said Ken Herbert, a San Francisco-based analyst with brokerage Canaccord Genuity. “If you’re a smaller supplier, that could be irreversible.”
Growth Drag
Worker shortages would add to the risk that the jet will act as a bigger drag on U.S. economic growth and the Dow Jones Industrial Average at a time when the White House and Wall Street are both worried about a recession. The manufacturer’s shares have tumbled 15% since the second crash, on March 10, prompted the global flying ban. Other investors have felt every painful ripple, since Boeing’s 9% weighting is the heaviest among the 30-member Dow.
The 737 program generated $23 billion in U.S. exports last year while providing about 90,000 jobs at Boeing and its suppliers, according to estimates by AlixPartners LLC. Boeing’s issues with the Max are large enough to “singlehandedly move the inventory outlook” for U.S. manufacturing,  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities said in an Aug. 23 report.
“It is very important to the U.S. economy,” said David Wireman, a managing director and co-leader of AlixPartners’s aerospace, defense and aviation practice. If there’s any change in production rate, “the problem becomes what do you do about the employee base?” he added. “Do they settle somewhere else? What is the loss of learning to Boeing?”
The U.S. labor market is robust, with the unemployment rate and initial jobless claims both hovering around half-century lows, and wage gains are near the best level of the economic expansion.
The total number of positions waiting to be filled remains near a record in data gathered since 2000, according to the Labor Department. Total vacancies exceed the number of unemployed Americans by 1.37 million, also near a record.
‘Ghosting’ Employers
The Federal Reserve’s anecdotal Beige Book survey offered a memorable sign of the historic tightness of the labor market in December. “A number of contacts said that they had been ‘ghosted,’ a situation in which a worker stops coming to work without notice and then is impossible to contact,” according to the part of the report from the Chicago district.
Spirit AeroSystems so far has avoided layoffs by adopting shorter work weeks over a 10-week stretch this summer. About 6,000 employees participated in the program, including salaried employees and CEO Tom Gentile. Ten unpaid furlough days are part of an initiative to trim expenses by 5% -- the amount of sales Spirit lost when Boeing scrapped plans to speed Max production in the grounding’s aftermath, Gentile said during the company’s July 31 earnings call. Half of Spirit’s revenue comes from building Max fuselages in Wichita, Kansas, then shipping them 1,800 miles by rail to Boeing’s Renton plant.
So far Boeing hasn’t furloughed any of its own employees, instead using the grounding to recover from parts shortages that disrupted its factory last year. Once the revamped Max is certified for flight, Boeing wants to rapidly ramp up work on its biggest money-maker -- and expects suppliers to be prepared as well.
For those companies, the effects of the Max saga couldn’t be more stark and unnerving, according to Herbert, the Canaccord Genuity analyst: a pedal-to-the metal speed-up just weeks away or, perhaps, a devastating slowdown. “Everyone is nervous as hell,” he said."
1074,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 29, 2019 07:00AM ET</span>",Thyssenkrupp CEO's last roll of the dice: sell the family silver,"By Christoph Steitz, Tom Käckenhoff and Edward Taylor
FRANKFURT/DUESSELDORF (Reuters) - Thyssenkrupp (DE:TKAG) CEO Guido Kerkhoff has little choice but to sell the group's prized elevator division lock, stock and barrel so he can save the conglomerate's remaining businesses, four sources close to the German company said.
Kerkhoff's preferred option is to list a minority stake in Thyssenkrupp's Elevator Technology (ET) but with financial pressures mounting on the company, a formal auction process that could get a deal faster has been launched, the sources said.
They said it would take at least until early 2020 to launch an IPO and a listing would only produce the best valuation in the right market environment - something that Kerkhoff cannot count on.
Kerkhoff said earlier this month that management would look at concrete offers and make a decision based on what is best for the group, its shareholders and the division.
""To rebuild the company you need cash,"" said Tomas Johansson, portfolio manager at SKAGEN Funds. ""Everyone knows that Thyssenkrupp needs to sell elevators. That's seldom the best time to do a transaction but they have no choice.""
Thyssenkrupp, whose roots go back more than two centuries, has been under pressure for years from shareholders - especially its second largest, Cevian Capital - to simplify its sprawling empire which includes subsidiaries making elevators, steel, car parts, warships, chemical plants and submarines.
The conglomerate's complex mix of disparate assets - 449 companies in 78 countries - is the result of efforts to diversify beyond steel-making through acquisitions and mergers, leaving the company hard to manage.
Efforts to slim down its portfolio suffered a setback when a proposed merger of its steel-making operations with Tata Steel's (NS:TISC) European divisions failed in May in the face of more demands from European antitrust regulators for concessions.
When the steel merger collapsed, Kerkhoff announced the plan to list ET, the world's fourth-biggest lift maker, and explore new ownership structures for some of its remaining units, including materials trading and plant engineering.
Initially welcomed by investors, doubts about the viability and effectiveness of Kerkhoff's plan have intensified as he struggles to stop what he calls ""the bleeding"" of cash.
At the moment, the group is losing 2.7 million euros ($3 million) of cash a day and will probably be kicked out of Germany's blue-chip index next month. Its debt is now deeper in junk territory following more downgrades this month from ratings agencies S&P and Moody's.
Thyssenkrupp's shares are trading near 16-year lows and its gearing stood at a staggering 204.5% at the end of June - meaning its net debt was twice as high as its total equity - all of which puts pressure on Kerkhoff to restructure quickly. 
(GRAPHIC-Rocky year for Thyssenkrupp shares link: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/12/4918/4875/Rocky%20year%20for%20Thyssenkrupp%20shares.png)
BULLSEYE NEEDED
As part of the elevator sale process, which kicks off in the fall, Kerkhoff has reached out to private equity firms to discuss offers, the sources said. Potential bidders include KKR (N:KKR), CVC, Advent, Apollo (N:APO), EQT, as well as Finnish elevator rival Kone (HE:KNEBV), among others.
First-round bids for the lift division, which is valued at anywhere from 12 billion to 17 billion euros, are expected in November with final offers due in January, one of the sources said.
Thyssenkrupp declined to comment on expected valuations or a timeline for any sale process.
The advantage of an outright sale to private equity firms - some of which are forming consortia to bid - is that a deal could be faster than an IPO and less exposed to the vagaries of the stock market, two people familiar with the matter said.
But private equity firms would probably demand outright control of the asset, forcing Kerkhoff to draw up a new business model for Thyssenkrupp without its elevator business.
One person also said the market's lack of confidence in Thyssenkrupp's management would make it unlikely that the company would be allowed to retain a significant stake.
Thyssenkrupp wants to ""maximize value while minimizing execution risks"", a separate source told Reuters, explaining that bids by rival elevator companies risked lengthy antitrust reviews while private equity bids would be easier to pull off.
A takeover by Kone, for example, would combine the world's third- and fourth-biggest elevator makers in market already dominated by a few large firms. The biggest, Otis, is itself being spun off from United Technologies Corp (N:UTX) next year.
""Antitrust ... is definitely a big, big hurdle for any attempt,"" said Thomas Oetterli, CEO of Switzerland's Schindler (S:SCHP), the world's second biggest elevator maker by sales, adding it would be ""incredibly difficult to get approvals"".
It might be less of a problem for smaller rivals including Japan's Mitsubishi Electric (T:6503), Fujitec (T:6406) and Hitachi (T:6501), one of the sources said.
Thomas Hechtfischer, managing director of shareholder advisory group DSW, which typically represents 1% of Thyssenkrupp's voting rights at annual general meetings, said there was no room for further missteps by Kerkhoff.
""The next shot needs to be a bullseye,"" he said.

'BAD ASSET'
Further chipping away at Kerkhoff's credibility, which has suffered from botched efforts to spin off Thyssenkrupp's capital goods units, are plans to restructure, sell or shut down those divisions burning the most cash.
The problem is that all those subsidiaries - system engineering, springs and stabilizers and heavy plate - operate in the steel and autos sectors, industries that have come under extreme pressure in recent months.
""Why would you try and sell a bad asset in a market environment at the worst possible time?"" one person familiar with the plans said.
Winding down the units, an option Kerkhoff has said was not being ruled out, will not be easy either. With a combined staff of 9,300, closing them would incur large restructuring costs at a time when Thyssenkrupp's balance sheet is already stretched.
Some analysts argue that far greater job cuts are needed. Bucephalus Research estimates that sacking 30,000 people, or 19% of total staff, is necessary for a serious overhaul but it would involve restructuring costs of about 3 billion euros.
Without an injection of cash from a sale of ET, Kerkhoff would struggle to fund even a portion of these layoffs - even if powerful labor representatives, who control half of the 20 seats on Thyssenkrupp's supervisory board, give the go-ahead.
""We are prepared for change but not at any price,"" said Markus Grolms, vice chairman of Thyssenkrupp's supervisory board and trade secretary at Germany's most powerful union, IG Metall. ""Swinging the axe does not address the group's problems.""
Grolms said it needed to improve the operating performance of its divisions, most of which are lagging rivals, echoing comments from the Alfried Krupp von Bohlen and Halbach Foundation, Thyssenkrupp's largest shareholder with a 21% stake.
Tapping new growth markets and developing innovative products would also require substantial funds, putting pressure on Kerkhoff to get his next move right after a series of setbacks, including four profit warnings under his watch.
""Thyssenkrupp faces a very challenging situation. The market environment and the economy have continued to deteriorate,"" the foundation said, adding that it supported the company's strategic path and remained convinced of its potential.

""The foundation wants the company to be competitive in its operating businesses, providing secure jobs and a sustainable ability to pay dividends.""

TOKYO (Reuters) - Sony Corp (T:6758) is selling its 5% stake in Olympus Corp (T:7733) back to the Japanese medical equipment maker for 80.4 billion yen ($762.88 million), a move that Daniel Loeb's activist hedge fund Third Point LLC had called for.
This is the first strategic move Sony has made that is in line with U.S.-based Third Point's proposals since Loeb, one of the world's highest-profile activist investors, revealed earlier this year he was building a stake again in the company.
A Sony spokeswoman said the sale was not in response to demand by specific shareholders, adding that the company is still reviewing Third Point's proposals.
Sony will sell 68.9 million Olympus shares at Thursday's closing price of 1,165 yen by participating in Olympus' share buyback plan.
Sony bought 11.5% of Olympus in 2012-13, paying 50 billion yen in a much-needed cash injection for the latter after an accounting scandal sent Olympus' share price plummeting. Sony later halved its stake to finance its own restructuring.
The companies have developed high-definition surgical endoscopes and microscopes through a medical equipment joint venture established in 2013.
Sony said in a statement it decided to sell ""considering that the initial purpose of the capital alliance to establish collaboration between Sony and Olympus has been accomplished and after reviewing the rationale for owning the Olympus shares.""
Loeb has called on Sony to spin off its semiconductor business and sell off stakes in Sony Financial, Spotify (NYSE:SPOT) and other non-core assets, in order to position itself as a leading global entertainment company.
""Sony's valuation discount is attributable primarily to portfolio complexity, which will be a permanent problem unless it is decisively addressed,"" Third Point said in a letter to investors in June.
Shares of Sony have risen 23% since early April, when Reuters reported that Loeb was building a stake in the company to push for change. The effort marks the second time in six years that Loeb has targeted Sony."

LONDON (Reuters) - Signs that Italy's latest political drama was over and hopeful noises from Beijing in the trade war pushed Europe's share markets higher on Thursday and paused the relentless steamrollering of global bond yields.
There was still plenty for bearish investors to chew on, however: A sudden rush from Argentina to restructure its debt thrust emerging market risk back into the spotlight, global recession worries simmered, and the pound was groggy after another Brexit-related tumble.
Nevertheless, European shares rose nearly 1% early on led by a 1.7% jump in Italy where the government's bond market borrowing costs also rallied to record lows.
That was after the country's 5-Star Movement and opposition Democratic Party said they would try to form a coalition, setting aside years of hostility to avert a snap election and the economic uncertainty that comes with it.
The two sides still need to agree on a shared policy platform and a team of ministers, but 5-Star chief Luigi Di Maio and his PD counterpart Nicola Zingaretti said they had pledged to find common ground for the good of the country.
""We love Italy and we consider it worthwhile to try this experience,"" Zingaretti told reporters. Speaking shortly afterwards, Di Maio said: ""We made commitments to the Italians...and come what may we want to fulfil them.""
There was little reaction from the euro but there was barely any currency market action generally. 
The Japanese yen was a touch higher heading for its biggest monthly rise since May, while sterling was flirting with a January 2017 low of $1.2015 against the dollar after Prime Minister Boris Johnson's plan on Wednesday to suspend Britain's parliament increased no-deal Brexit nerves.
China's yuan had dipped for an 11th straight session although a firmer-than-expected central bank fixing helped stem deeper losses and against a basket of currencies the dollar was steady around 98.190.
On the latest trade war development, China said it and the United States were discussing the next round of face-to-face trade talks in September and voiced hopes that U.S. President Donald Trump would cancel plans for additional trade tariffs.
In the latest tit-for-tat escalation of the trade war between the world's two largest economies, Trump last Friday announced additional duties of 5% on targeted Chinese imports worth about $550 billion to be imposed in stages from Sept 1 to mid-December.
The announcement came hours after China had unveiled retaliatory tariffs on $75 billion worth of U.S. goods.
""The most important thing at the moment is to create necessary conditions for both sides to continue negotiations,"" China's commerce ministry spokesman, Gao Feng, told reporters.
HOW LOW CAN YOU GO 
The comments had come after a choppy Asian session. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 0.15%, Singapore shares hit eight-month lows and Japan's Nikkei ended fractionally lower.
Bond markets around the world were also still grappling with recession worries. Yields on 30-year U.S. Treasuries and 10-year German bunds had both hit record lows - 1.905 percent and minus 0.716 percent respectively.
Inversion also remains a prominent feature across the U.S. yield curve, where long-dated yields are below short-dated ones - a reliable indicator ahead of U.S. recessions in the past.
The 10-year Japanese government bond yield had dipped 1 basis point to minus 0.285% overnight too, which is just above its record low of minus 0.300% touched in 2016.
""Falls in global bond yields reflect growing concerns that long-term global growth is slowing down on U.S.-China tensions and worries over subsequent global supply chain disruptions,"" said Tomoo Kinoshita, global market strategist at Invesco Asset Management in Tokyo.
""Stock markets on the other hand are supported in the near-term by hopes of more stimulus, notably from the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank,"" he said.
The two major central banks are expected to cut rates next month, while many investors believe the Bank of Japan could join the fray if market sentiment weakens further.

ARGENTINA RESTRUCTURING
Precious metal investors were still on a quest to buy safer assets. 
Gold rose as high as $1,543 per ounce, near six-year highs of $1,556.1 set earlier in the week, while silver rose 1.2% to $18.55 per ounce which is just shy of a 2017 peak of $18.65 an ounce.
Also reflecting nervousness, the Merrill Lynch move index, a gauge of investors' expectations on how volatile U.S. bonds will be, has risen back near three-year highs marked earlier this month.
The MSCI emerging market currency index was also at its lowest levels since mid-November, having fallen 0.9% so far this week and set for its biggest monthly fall in more than seven years.
The latest hit came in Argentina as it said it wanted to restructure a large chunk of its bonds by extending their maturities and to ""re-profile"" the maturities of debt owed to the IMF under a $57 billion standby agreement.
The battered peso took another hammering on Wednesday, even though the central bank intervened heavily in the foreign exchange market for a second consecutive day.
Argentine assets have been slammed since business-friendly President Mauricio Macri was trounced in primary elections by centre-left Peronist challenger Alberto Fernandez.

""President Macri instructed me to solve the short-term problem to guarantee electoral stability, but also in the medium- and long-term so as not to leave a problem for the person who follows, be it he or another candidate,"" Argentina's Treasury Minister, Hernan Lacunza, said.

1082,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 29, 2019 05:38AM ET</span>","StockBeat: Micro Focus Shows Software Can Be Hard, Too","By Geoffrey Smith
Investing.com -- The received wisdom in business is that hardware is hard. But software isn’t finding things much easier right now, either.
Shares in   Micro Focus   International (LON:MCRO), a London-listed group that caters to large companies’ IT needs, fell by as much as a third on Thursday morning after another profit warning, before recovering to trade down only 25% by 5 AM ET (0900).
That was firmly at the bottom of a FTSE 100 that was up 1.0%, up in line with other European markets on hopes for a resumption of trade talks between the U.S. and China. The benchmark Stoxx 600 was up 0.9%, while the German DAX was up 1.0% and the FTSE MIB again led the way with a 1.8% gain after news that the Five Star Movement and Democratic Party will after all form a new government, removing the risk of snap elections for another few months at least.
Admittedly, much of Micro Focus' (NYSE:MFGP) woes are unique to itself and stem from a misjudged acquisition of parts of HP Enterprise back in 2017. The company had already admitted last year that the integration was running a year behind schedule, and the latest update admitted to “weak sales execution”.
However, it also flagged a problem that’s spreading fast among the computer nerd sector: “a deteriorating macro environment resulting in more conservatism and longer decision-making cycles within our customer base.”
Or in layman’s terms: businesses don’t invest when trade wars and Brexit mean that you can’t plan beyond the next Presidential tweet or the next twist in an endless British political psychodrama. Business investment in Micro Focus’s home market of the U.K. has only risen in one of the last six quarters, according to the Office for National Statistics.
Micro Focus now expects its revenue adjusted for foreign exchange fluctuations to fall by between 6% and 8% for the year through October, rather than the 4% to 6% drop it previously expected. It’s also launching a strategic review of operations.
The warning comes only two days after shares in U.S.-based Autodesk (NASDAQ:ADSK) fell 10% after it cut guidance for the current quarter and year citing the impact of the U.S.-China trade war. 
Other software companies are showing signs of struggling too: SAP (DE:SAPG), Germany’s most valuable company, has fallen 13% in the last two months, giving up most of the gains it made since activist investor Elliott Management took a stake in it.   Software   AG (DE:SOWGn), a German midcap, is also down 20% since the start of July after also downgrading its guidance. France’s Dassault Systemes (PA:DAST) is down 14% in the same timeframe, as is the FTSE All Share Software & Computer Services index.
The Stoxx 600, meanwhile, has lost only 4.1% in that time."

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's Supreme Court on Thursday ruled that a bribery case against the heir of the Samsung Group should be reviewed by a lower court, raising the possibility of a tougher sentence and potential return to jail.
The Supreme Court overturned part of an appeals court bribery conviction against Samsung's de facto chief Jay Y. Lee, who had been given a two-and-a-half-year suspended sentence for seeking favor from the country's ex-leader.
The Court said the interpretation by the Seoul High Court on what constituted bribes by Samsung to then-President Park Geun-hye was too narrow and returned the case to the appellate court.
""The appeals court's ruling was based on the premise that the horses defendants gave to Choi Seo-won were not to be considered bribes, misinterpreting the principle of law regarding bribery and mistakenly affecting the ruling,"" Chief Justice Kim Myeong-su said.
Choi is a confidante of the former president who was convicted of bribery and other charges and is serving a 20-year prison sentence.
The case against Lee centered on whether three horses donated by Samsung Group for the training of the daughter of Choi, a competitive equestrian, should be considered bribes aimed at winning the president's favor in the conglomerate's succession planning.
""The court overturned the part of the appeals court rulings that found him not guilty. That means it is inevitable he will get a heavier sentence,"" said attorney Choi Jin-nyoung, who is not involved in the case.
A sentence of more than three years would mean immediate incarceration as a suspension of sentence is only permitted for terms of up to three years under South Korean law.
Court documents showed Park asked Lee to help the daughter and was convicted on grounds that the horses were bribes worth around 3.7 billion won ($3.05 million). However, the horses were not recognized as such in Lee's trial, helping reduce his sentence.
The Supreme Court said however the appeals court erred in not recognizing the horses as bribes given by Samsung to win favors.
Park was impeached in 2017 after weeks of street protests demanding her ouster for abuse of power and corruption.
The Supreme Court also ruled the High Court erred in its decision against Park on procedural points, ordering a review. The review is unlikely to significantly alter the 25-year sentence she is serving.
""CRISIS"" 
The ruling cast doubt whether Lee, 51, can focus on steering the group's flagship Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) Co Ltd through falling profitability and Japanese export curbs on materials crucial for the world's leading chipmaker. 
Japan's decision last month to restrict exports of key chipmaking chemicals following a diplomatic dispute threatens to disrupt production of memory chips, South Korea's biggest export item.
Lee has since been on a high-profile mission to tackle what he told his lieutenants was a ""crisis"".
Officials at Samsung are concerned about what his absence would mean for key management strategies in a tougher business climate than when Lee was arrested in 2017, a person with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters.
Lee, vice chairman of Samsung Electronics, was sentenced in 2017 to five years imprisonment for bribing a friend of Park as he sought to succeed his father and strengthen control of Samsung Group.
He was freed after a year in detention when the appellate Seoul High Court halved his sentence and suspended it for four years. Both Lee, who denies wrongdoing, and prosecutors appealed.
Speaking to reporters after the ruling, Lee's lawyer denied Samsung received any favors from Park and said any payment made by Samsung was in response to a demand from the now-deposed leader, an argument it had made in lower court trials.
""The Supreme Court decision is regrettable in the sense that it found providing financial support at the demand of the President constituted a bribe,"" said Lee In-jae from Bae, Kim & Lee that represents Jay Y. Lee and former Samsung executives.
""The defendants feel very sorry to have caused disappointment and concern to many over this matter,"" he said.
By close of trade on Thursday, shares in 12 out of the 15 listed Samsung Group affiliates fell, with Samsung Electronics falling 1.7% and Samsung BioLogics Co Ltd plunging 4.9%, helping push the benchmark KOSPI down 0.4%.
Analysts said Jay Y. Lee's possible return to prison will have little impact on the chip giant's performance. 
Three professional chief executives run Samsung Electronics' divisions of components, handsets and home appliances.
Park Jung-hoon, fund manager at HDC Asset Management which owns Samsung Electronics shares, said Lee's return to jail will have little impact on Samsung management or earnings, and could soon be entitled to a presidential pardon, given economic difficulties Samsung and the country face. 
""The ruling could cause short-tern volatility to the market, but will ease uncertainty about the three-year-long case,"" Park said.

After the Supreme Court's decision, Samsung Electronics said the company would ""avoid a recurrence of past mistakes"" and promised to continue to contribute the country's economy.

1084,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 29, 2019 04:33AM ET</span>",Peugeot Workers Target Brexit Spoils ,"(Bloomberg) -- Autoworkers in continental Europe are angling to snatch Vauxhall production that owner PSA Group plans to move out of the U.K. if Prime Minister Boris Johnson follows through on the threat of a no-deal Brexit.
Vauxhall’s Ellesmere Port plant near Liverpool is in line to build an upgraded version of the Astra model, subject to a split that doesn’t wipe out profits with tariffs, component delays or a weaker pound. With the no-deal risk rising after Johnson decided to suspend parliament, France, Spain, Germany or Portugal are poised to mop up work if an accord with the European Union can’t be reached.
“French plants could legitimately make this vehicle if a hard Brexit happens,” said Patrick Michel, a Force Ouvriere union representative at PSA, proposing the company’s Peugeot sites in Sochaux and Mulhouse as possible contenders.
U.K. carmakers have been saying since the 2016 referendum on Britain’s EU membership that a no-deal split would be a disaster. Honda Motor Co. is already shuttering a site in Swindon that employs 3,500 people, and Nissan Motor Co. no longer plans to build the X-Trail sport utility vehicle at the country’s biggest auto plant in Sunderland.
PSA Chief Executive Officer Carlos Tavares said last month that all production will be pulled from Ellesmere Port if Brexit makes it impossible to turn a profit at a factory that has 1,000 workers and made 77,000 Astras last year. A plant in southern Europe has been earmarked as an alternative location for the new model, he said.
Spokesmen for PSA and Vauxhall declined to comment further following Johnson’s latest pronouncements.
The Paris-based group inherited Vauxhall in 2017 when it bought the carmaker’s German sibling Opel from General Motors Co (NYSE:GM)., under which the U.K. business had survived intact as Opel sites including Bochum were closed.
Tavares said in June that the next-generation Opel Astra will be made at that brand’s main Russelsheim plant in Germany from 2021. The Vauxhall-badged version would be built at Ellesmere Port -- conditional on the U.K.’s Brexit terms and a cost-cutting labor agreement.
The FO union’s Michel said French sites that also include one in Rennes would negotiate with management to secure the Astra, while suggesting lower-cost Spanish factories in Vigo, Zaragoza and Madrid, may be better placed. PSA has an additional plant in Mangualde, Portugal, and the Astra is also made in Gliwice, Poland, though the location is due to focus on vans.
Vauxhall already plans to cut more than 200 jobs from Ellesmere Port’s payroll. A smaller plant in Luton, where the brand is based, will benefit from an electric version of the Vivaro van from 2020, increasing its capacity to 100,000 vehicles a year and helping to safeguard it against closure.
About 80% of all cars made in the U.K. are exported, with half of those going to the EU, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders. Britain accounts for about 10% of PSA’s global unit sales.
Where the U.K.’s other key auto plants stand:
Honda shocked the industry in February when it announced plans to close the Swindon site, which makes Civic hatchbacks. The news came after Nissan ended moves to build X-Trail sport utility vehicles at a Sunderland plant employing more than 7,000, and said it would stop producing upscale Infiniti cars there.
Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co. said in June that its Bridgend engine plant in Wales will be shuttered by September next year, though the move is part of a Europe-wide retrenchment.
Jaguar Land Rover, Britain’s biggest automaker, is building the Jaguar I-Pace SUV, its first all-electric car, in Austria and shifting production of the Land Rover Discovery to Slovakia. At the same time, it’s retooling its Solihull plant to make electric versions of top-end Range Rovers and last month announced that a range of electric Jaguars will be assembled at nearby Castle Bromwich.
BMW AG starts production of an electric Mini in the U.K. this year, and has said there are no plans for any changes to its four U.K. plants.
Aston Martin Lagonda Plc, which has lowered its full-year sales forecast in response to slowing sales in Europe, opened a new factory in Wales this year to make the DBX SUV touted as the biggest driver of future sales."

The U.K. software company is cutting its full year constant currency revenue guidance to minus 6% to 8%, down from minus 4% to 6%. It blamed a deteriorating macro environment, resulting in more conservatism and longer decision making cycles among its customers, according to a statement Thursday.
Shares in Micro Focus fell as much as 27% during early trading in London, the most since March 2018.
Micro Focus is also accelerating a strategic review of the group’s operations, and will consider a range of strategic, operational and financial alternatives available.
It was only in July that the company said it was maintaining its full year guidance, as it continued to battle integrating the $8.8 billion of software assets it bought from Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co. two years ago.
Micro Focus has built a business model on acquiring legacy software assets and squeezing out costs. In 2017 it bought Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s software assets, such as application delivery management, big-data analytics and enterprise security, but has struggled to integrate the deal, causing the departure of its chief executive officer.
Investors have continued to question the company’s ability to integrate HPE’s assets, with shares falling 11% over the past month. Elliott Management Corp., the New York hedge fund run by billionaire Paul Singer, built up a position in the company last year.
""Following the recent disappointing trading performance, we have determined that it is appropriate to accelerate the undertaking of a strategic review of the Group’s operations,"" said Stephen Murdoch, chief executive officer of Micro Focus.
The company declined to give more details on the strategic review. In July 2018 the company agreed to sell its infrastructure software business SUSE to private equity firm EQT Partners AB for $2.54 billion in cash.

(Reuters) - European shares rose after a weak open on Thursday, boosted by a rally in Italian shares, with positive comments from China on its trade talks with the United States helping sentiment.
China's Commerce Ministry said both sides ""should create conditions"" for progress in negotiations and that China was against escalating the trade war and was willing to resolve the issue calmly.
""There seems to be some easing of trade worries that is giving a bit of boost to risky assets and stocks in particular,"" said Simona Gambarini, markets economist at Capital Economics in London.
The gains in markets were largely broad-based and the benchmark index (STOXX), which was flat in early trading, rose 0.61% by 0755 GMT.
Italian stocks (FTMIB) rose 1.33% to hit its highest level since Aug. 2 as President Sergio Mattarella is expected to give two former political enemies, the 5-Star Movement and Democratic Party (PD), a chance to form a new government on Thursday.
""The news is being welcomed because it's certainly a better option than a League-led government,"" said Gambarini.
""That said, the 5-star Movement and PD notoriously have not had much in common in the past and it remains to be seen whether the coalition will last.""
However, worries lingered in the markets.
The benchmark European index is on track to end August about 3% lower as an inversion in the U.S. Treasury yield curve showed investors were concerned about economic growth in the face of a trade war that is now in its second year.
Fears of a disorderly Brexit weighed on Britain's mid-cap index (FTMC), which slid for a second day in a row, after Prime Minister Boris Johnson decided to suspend Britain's parliament for more than a month before Brexit.
Johnson's move also increases the chance of him facing a vote of no-confidence in his government, and possibly an election.

1091,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 29, 2019 01:45AM ET</span>","As bond e-trading takes off, debt sales business may be ripe for automation","By Virginia Furness
LONDON (Reuters) - With banks' bond trading desks increasingly going electronic, another of the last bastions of old-school banking - the business of helping companies and countries raise capital - may be about to succumb to the tide of technology.
A clutch of start-ups want to disrupt the cosy world of syndicated debt sales, where borrowers enlist banks' help to raise capital from investors, by using new technology to shake up the sector.
""There is a lot of money spent on mundane work like data entry, which tends to be done at a very high cost, by highly paid people in highly expensive office space,"" said Richard Cohen, legal counsel at London-based Nivaura, which is pitching its digital capital markets platform to banks.
Such start-ups are touting a one-stop-shop digital platform that will automate the generation and tracking of deal-related data. It will end manual processing through artificial intelligence, blockchain and ""smart tech"". Some even hope to use their technology to connect smaller borrowers with investors directly, eventually cutting out middlemen banks altogether.
Up against them is the world of primary syndicated debt sales, which has been slow to adopt new technology and is virtually unchanged in 25 years.
By contrast, equity and currency markets embraced the shift to electronic systems more than a decade ago and bond trading has gone the same way in recent years.
The resistance to the march of the machines comes down to the relationship-driven nature of bond sales. Successful pitches can hinge on person-to-person ties forged over lunches in City restaurants, while bankers leave a long paper-trail of documentation on deals that can take months of back-and-forth.
The sheer volume of analysis and the number of parties involved - from banks to law firms to investors - also make it harder to reduce primary dealership business to spreadsheets. Planning deals can take months of delicate negotiations between bank, borrower and end investor.
FALLING PROFITS
Banks' resistance to change may be overcome by the squeeze on profitability, however.
Tighter regulation, competition and lower fees from primary bond issuance were behind a 7% fall last year in debt capital market revenues at banks tracked by analytics firm Coalition.
At troubled  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), debt origination revenues fell 19% for the 2018 full year, from a year earlier, its annual report shows.
Global bond issuance fell by 4% in the first half of 2019 to $3.63 trillion, according to data from analytics provider Dealogic. A total of $11.7 billion was earned by investment banks in H1 for bond sales, the data showed.
Daniel Fletcher, partner in the International Capital Markets team of Allen & Overy said the primary dealing process could be automated from end-to-end for greater efficiency.
""Systems and parties are still disjointed; there are a lot of silos and you can to some degree automate or connect every part of that process,"" Fletcher said.
Electronification may boost banks' debt capital market (DCM) earnings by cutting costs and increasing deal volumes. Nivaura says its technology can reduce transaction times and costs by 55% and allow personnel to be redeployed into higher value work.
These start-ups say their technology will also help smaller companies for whom bond markets can be prohibitively expensive, by reducing the costs of raising capital.
Improving the process may also prove crucial at a time when developed governments are preparing to issue more debt to fund infrastructure in a bid to boost growth.
Charlie Berman, a former Citi and  Barclays  (LON:BARC) banker who co-founded Agora, a start-up looking to streamline bond deals, described the documentation needed for a governments to raise infrastructure financing as ""nightmarish"".
ART NOT SCIENCE
However, many bankers say the advisory nature of debt origination and syndication, which practitioners describe as an art not a science, cannot be replaced by data-churning machines.
And there are concerns that the technology will accelerate job cuts across the banking sector if automated platforms see borrowers connecting directly with investors.
Jean-Marc Mercier, global co-head of DCM at HSBC, said newer technology would help bankers better understand the investor base - for instance how they might trade the bonds or how ""green"" their credentials are - using live analytics and a vast database to track the profile, previous orders and trading behavior of the buyside.
But the choice of when to launch a deal or at what size needs the human input, he said.
""We have seen some of the startups trying to allocate wealth to funds automatically and it is fine at a low level, but do you trust a machine?"" Mercer said.
""As soon as you have a bit more money involved, you want to see the white of someone's eye, and trust they are doing the right thing.""
Indeed, initiatives to connect issuers directly with investors are yet to take off.
Europe is still consulting on a new issuance platform -- European Distribution of Debt Instruments (EDDI) -- which banks would use for book-building, pricing and settlement of bonds.
In the United States, Project MARS, a platform for corporate bond issuance backed by a consortium of banks is trying to connect investors directly to issuers but is making slow progress, according to people familiar with the product.
Agora's Berman says it is premature to expect bond-issuing companies and governments to ditch bank intermediaries and go to market directly.
Instead, Agora aims to use distributed ledger technology -- a confidential permissioned blockchain -- to replace the paper-trail and manual processes involved in bond deals.
""It is fashionable to say we don't see a future for banks but that does not acknowledge the huge complexities involved such as managing counterparty risk, complying with know-your client and anti-money laundering (regulations)"" Berman said.
""I don't see issuers and investors wanting to face off against each other anytime soon."""

LONDON (Reuters) - Sovereign wealth funds' distaste for equities mostly faded in the second quarter, with some investors turning to emerging- market passive equity funds, data from the research firm eVestment showed on Thursday.
Passively managed equity funds outside the United States took in $1.77 billion from sovereign investors during the quarter, after allocations shrank in the previous three quarters. Outflows from all global equity funds dwindled to $652.7 million, much less than in recent quarters.
""Negative sentiment in aggregate by sovereign wealth funds toward global equity exposure mostly disappeared in (the) second-quarter, replaced in part by clear demand for passive emerging market equity exposure,"" said Peter Laurelli, global head of research at eVestment, which collates data from firms managing money on behalf of institutional investors.
Global stocks, as measured by MSCI All Country World Index, rose 1.8% in the second quarter. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index slipped 1.4%. Worries about the U.S. China trade war and the risk of a global recession have buffeted both markets since.
Slowing redemptions in passive European, Australian, Far Eastern and global equity funds and active large-cap Japan and all cap Asia ex-Japan equity funds were one reason for the greater interest in non-U.S. equity exposure, Laurelli said.
Emerging-market passive equity funds brought in $1.92 billion during the quarter, taking their allocations to nearly $7 billion since the beginning of 2018.
""At the same time, there have been net outflows from active global emerging-market equity strategies, which implies that sovereign wealth funds want emerging-markets equity exposure, but they are less interested in getting this exposure through traditional actively managed products,"" said Laurelli.
Within fixed income, outflows continued during the quarter from U.S. fixed income funds, but global fixed income saw inflows of $841.5 million, down slightly from the previous period.
Sovereign wealth funds shifted into global government fixed income, putting in $1.86 billion during the quarter, a turnaround from outflows in the three previous quarters.
In a bid to seek cover from the risk of a global downturn, investors have been snapping up bonds, sending negative yields cascading across the euro zone."
1093,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 29, 2019 12:29AM ET</span>",Halloween Brexit will continue to spook UK stocks into next year: Reuters poll,"By Thyagaraju Adinarayan and Josephine Mason
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's deepening political crisis over its exit from the European Union will weigh on London's blue-chip stocks index (FTSE) well into next year, as investors continue to steer clear of the region's assets, according to a Reuters poll.
The U.S.-China trade war, a no-deal Brexit and deteriorating global economy were top reasons cited for the subdued outlook for UK equities in the latest survey of 22 fund managers, investors and analysts taken in the past two weeks.
Britain's top stock index is expected to reach 7,300 points by the end of 2019, just 3% higher than current levels. It would represent an 8.5% gain for the year, partially reversing the more than 12% decline seen last year.
But it's also down from the 7,499 estimated in the last poll in May, highlighting how confidence has deteriorated since Boris Johnson, a staunch supporter of Brexit, replaced Theresa May as prime minister last month.
The latest survey was taken between Aug. 13 and Aug. 27, before Johnson moved on Wednesday to limit parliament's ability to delay Brexit by reducing how long it will sit before the EU exit deadline on Oct. 31. His move roiled UK financial markets.
""Until the fate of the UK/EU relationship is known we expect fundamentals to be ignored and global asset allocators to continue to shun UK risk assets,"" Edward Park at Brooks Macdonald said.
The majority of the FTSE 100 constituents earn their revenue abroad and so are relatively well insulated from any slowdown in consumer spending if the country left the European Union without a deal on trade and other ties.
So the lackluster outlook for the benchmark equity index revealed in the poll highlights the extent to which Brexit worries are spreading across all British assets.
The estimate for year-end levels would mean Britain lagged its European and U.S. peers, which are both heading for double-digit percentage gains this year.
FTSE 100 poll forecast - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/buzzifr/14/4962/4962/Pasted%20Image.jpg
LITTLE CONVICTION
FTSE 100 index forecasts for the end of 2019 ranged from 6,200 to as high as 8,000 points, reflecting the lack of consensus about the direction of markets two months before the Oct. 31 Brexit deadline.
By the middle of next year, participants expect the index to have dipped to 7,225 but then reach 7,570 by the end of the year. That would represent a near 4% rise from the estimated end of 2019 level.
The blue-chip index has risen this year due in large part due to the weaker sterling, hurt by concerns about a no-deal Brexit as well as on hopes of a truce between China and the United States to end their trade spat.
But Macroeconomic data has shown signs of pain too. Britain's gross domestic product declined 0.2% quarter-on-quarter in the second quarter, compared with a 0.5% rise in the first quarter and a surprise drop versus a Reuters poll that was forecasting zero GDP growth.
Since the 2016 vote to leave the European Union, British stocks have severely underperformed the world in dollar terms and this year looks no different.

Many participants said British and European markets were skewed to the downside and expected some wild moves given falling trading volumes.
""Dovish central banks are a consolation, but the escalation in the trade war increases the downside risk for the global economy while Brexit uncertainty is rising, and the poor summer liquidity might exacerbate market moves,""  Barclays  (LON:BARC) European equity strategist Emmanuel Cau said."

""We are in regular contact with the FTC on many issues and products, including Messenger Kids,"" Facebook Vice President Kevin Martin wrote in a letter to two Democrats, which is seen by Reuters. He described the flaw as a ""technical error"".
The letter dated Aug. 27 was sent to Democratic Senators Ed Markey of Massachusetts and Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut.
""Based on our review, we have determined that the technical error you have inquired above arose in October 2018. The fix we implemented is designed to prevent the issue from happening again,"" Facebook said in the letter.

1096,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 28, 2019 10:31PM ET</span>","Hikvision, a surveillance powerhouse, walks U.S.-China tightrope","By Cate Cadell
BEIJING (Reuters) - For China's Hikvision, the world's largest purveyor of video surveillance systems and a vendor to Xinjiang police agencies, a moment of reckoning may be at hand.
Since Aug. 13, Hikvision has not been allowed to sell to U.S. federal government agencies, thanks to a law passed last year that blocked five Chinese firms as possible security threats because their products could allow access to sensitive systems.
That has forced the company - which pulls nearly 30% of its 50 billion yuan ($7.12 billion) in revenue from overseas - onto a tightrope: it must assuage security and human rights concerns in the West without angering the Chinese government, a major customer and an all-powerful regulator.
The company, known as Hangzhou Hikvision Digital Technology Co Ltd, is publicly trying to distance itself from Xinjiang as it lobbies to ease U.S. restrictions.
Hikvision signed 1.9 billion yuan worth of public-private partnership contracts - worth an average of 370 million yuan each - with the police in Xinjiang between 2016 and 2017, the procurement documents show.
Although the Xinjiang deals have gotten smaller since the U.S. Congress passed the ban last year, previously unreported provincial government procurement documents reviewed by Reuters show that Hikvision surveillance equipment was named in more than 110 million yuan worth of contracts with Chinese police, military and courts there.
The United Nations says that there are credible estimates of roughly a million people, mostly from the Muslim Uighur minority, having been detained in Xinjiang without formal charges.
A Hikvision representative said the company ""takes global human rights very seriously"" and noted that its technology also was used in shops, traffic control and commercial buildings.
""We don't know where and how our products being sold or being used,"" the representative said of Xinjiang. ""But all our business is required to align with the company's compliance policy.""
Hikvision declined to say what its compliance policy was, but said it was in line with local laws.
China's Public Security Bureau and the Public Security Bureau of the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region, where the tendered projects are located, did not respond to faxed requests for comment.
Foreign investors who once piled into the company, including UBS AG, have dumped at least 300 million shares of its stock in the last five months, shareholder data shows, with some citing concerns about its involvement in China's expanding surveillance state in the Xinjiang region.
""Hikvision needs to decide whether it wants to be a global company or ... just be a China-based business,"" said one former top investor in Hikvision who sold his stake over human rights concerns. He spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the media.
XINJIANG CONTRACTS
The core of Hikvision's business is surveillance cameras, which have become ubiquitous in many parts of the world. It also sells much more elaborate integrated systems, often including facial recognition technology, as well as providing hardware to other security vendors.
The projects in 2016-17 include facial recognition and surveillance systems for mosques, the documents and Hikvision said. Human rights groups say such cutting-edge mass surveillance is at the heart of a campaign of repression.
Documents also listed such systems for a ""training center"" - the phrase used by Chinese authorities to describe what outside researchers say are internment camps. Hikvision confirmed its involvement in that project.
Since the U.S. procurement ban in August 2018, Hikvision technology was mentioned in at least 27 state-issued tenders in Xinjiang's Uighur Autonomous Region, including contracts to supply surveillance equipment to the police, the military and the courts.
Collectively they were worth at least 110.5 million yuan, the procurement documents show.
Many of the tenders are heavily redacted to remove project specifics, total budgets and itemized costs. But a review of 6 million yuan worth of Hikvision technology in the tenders shows thousands of the company's surveillance cameras as well as technology to store and transmit data.
One project from the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region Public Security Department dated Sept. 28, 2018 calls for 50 Hikvision camera units worth a total of 425,000 yuan. Another project, surveillance upgrades for a military Communist Party committee in Urumqi worth 510,000 yuan, listed Hikvision as the ""main"" equipment supplier in a procurement tender dated April 10, 2018.
The company's technology has also been used in at least 180 million yuan worth of smaller contracts since the beginning of 2018, including commercial, military and police projects.
The Hikvision representative said the company does not always know where its technology is sold through third parties.
China's Public Security Bureau and the Public Security Bureau of the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region, did not respond to faxed requests for comment.
Kevin Manning, a Commerce Department spokesman, declined to comment on Hikvision and whether the agency would add it to the Entity List, citing a policy that the agency does not comment on potential additions to the list.
Reuters reported in May the administration was considering Huawei-like sanctions on Hikvision over China's treatment of the Uighurs.
And fears of China's high-tech surveillance programs have spurred protester backlash in Hong Kong, which uses equipment from Hikvision and other Chinese surveillance companies.
INVESTOR EXODUS
Despite the selloff by foreign investors, Hikvision has continued to grow. Revenues for the first half of 2019 were up 14.6% over the previous years to 23.9 billion yuan in the first-half. 29% of sales came from overseas markets, compared with 30% a year ago, and nearly half the revenue came from ""front-end products"" such as cameras.
Hikvision is 42% owned by Chinese state investors and its two key founders.
As of Aug 6, investors using the Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect, which allows international investors to trade Hikvision's Chinese-listed stock, held a total of 582 million shares in the company, down 34 percent from 879.5 million shares at the end of March, according to HKEX data.
Its stock has fallen 4.2% during the last year. The company's only direct institutional foreign investor, UBS AG, which was Hikvision's ninth-largest shareholder in March 2019, has since dropped out of the company's top 10 investors, company data showed.
UBS declined to comment.
Hikvision has begun lobbying efforts in the U.S. amid concerns about how its surveillance tech is used.
Hikvision's U.S. subsidiary paid two lobbying organizations, the Glover Park Group and Sidley Austin, about $1.63 million in fees since June 2018 for work related to the NDAA, according to public filings. Neither company responded to requests for comment.
The company's efforts to burnish its image also include the public release of a 99-page environmental, social and governance report in April, which made no mention of Xinjiang.
The report said the company had hired U.S. law firm Arent Fox LLP in the past year to conduct an internal review to ""better protect"" human rights.
The review, overseen by Arent Fox partner Pierre-Richard Prosper, a former U.S. Ambassador-at-Large for War Crimes Issues, included at least two trips to China, the report said.
Hikvision confirmed the trips included Xinjiang, but said the firm had not yet compiled a report of the trips' findings.
Arent Fox and Prosper did not respond to requests for comment."
1097,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 28, 2019 09:46PM ET</span>",Huawei plans high-end phone launch under cloud of Google ban,"By Kenneth Li and Douglas Busvine
NEW YORK/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Huawei Technologies plans to forge ahead with the launch of new high-end smartphones in Europe even though it may not be able to offer Google's official Android operating system and widely used apps such as Google Maps, company executives told Reuters. 
The world’s No. 2 smartphone maker is set to unveil its new Mate 30 line of phones on Sept. 18 in Munich, according to a source familiar with the matter, though it is not clear when the devices would go on sale.
The Mate 30, made to work on new 5G mobile networks, is Huawei's first major flagship smartphone launch since U.S. President Donald Trump's administration effectively blacklisted the company in mid-May, alleging it is involved in activities that compromise U.S. national security, a charge the company denies.
A Google spokesman told Reuters the Mate 30 cannot be sold with licensed Google apps and services due to the U.S. ban on sales to Huawei. A temporary reprieve that the U.S. government announced last week does not apply to new products such as the Mate 30, the spokesman said.
U.S. companies can seek a license for specific products to be exempted from the ban. Google, a part of Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc, would not say whether it had applied for a license to offer its apps and services known as Google Mobile Services, though it has said in the past that it wants to continue supplying Huawei.
Reuters reported this week that the U.S. Commerce Department has received more than 130 applications from companies for licenses to sell U.S. goods to Huawei, but none have been granted.
The uncertainty surrounding the Mate 30 shows the confusion that reigns for Huawei and its business partners as a result of the escalating trade war between China and the United States. While the Huawei blacklisting was cast as a response to security concerns, President Trump has indicated it could be lifted as part of a trade deal. 
""Huawei will continue to use the Android OS and ecosystem if the U.S. government allows us to do so,"" Huawei spokesman Joe Kelly told Reuters. ""Otherwise, we will continue to develop our own operating system and ecosystem.""
The Commerce Department declined to comment. 
NO GOOGLE, NO SALES? 
Huawei can likely use an open-source version of Android without falling foul of the U.S. ban on sales to them. But Google's apps can only be used in Europe under a paid license from the search giant. There is no fee for the license outside of Europe.
""Without Google Services, no one will buy the device,"" said independent analyst Richard Windsor. The Google software normally comes pre-loaded on Android devices.
Huawei earlier this month announced its own mobile operating system, dubbed Harmony. But analysts and Huawei executives are skeptical that it is yet a viable alternative to Android.
Huawei vaulted quickly into the top ranks of the global smartphone business in recent years with highly regarded hardware, and Europe has been a key market. 
But the U.S. ban has dealt a body blow to sales outside of China, with Huawei’s market share in Europe sliding to 19.3% in the second quarter from 24.9% in the first, figures from Counterpoint Research show.
As late as last week, senior Huawei executives struck a confident tone regarding Android and Google.
""Our new phones will still be based on Android,"" Vincent Pang, senior vice president and board director of Huawei, told a media gathering at the top of New York City's One World Trade Center, an iconic American symbol of perseverance.
""We want to maintain one standard, one ecosystem, one technology,"" he said.
CHIPS IN THE CLEAR
Huawei is confident that other hardware in the new phone will be compliant with U.S. law. 
The brains of the Mate 30 line, the Kirin 990 chipset, will be formally unveiled on Sept. 6 by Richard Yu, Huawei’s top consumer executive, when he gives the opening keynote address at the IFA consumer tech fair in Berlin.
The Kirin 990 was developed by HiSilicon, Huawei's chips unit, based on blueprints from British chip designer ARM Holdings (LON:ARM), owned by Japan's SoftBank. 
ARM severed relations with Huawei after the U.S. ban because its designs contain technology of U.S. origin. But a source familiar with Huawei's plan said its ARM license is based on work that predated the blacklisting of Huawei.
Huawei last week said it has perpetual ownership of the ARMv8 license and chips based on it, including the Kirin 990, would not be affected by the ban.

ARM declined to comment on its relationship with Huawei, saying only that ""ARM continues to remain compliant with the latest U.S. Commerce Department restrictions and we are adhering to the guidelines related to the specific types of conversations permitted, technical or otherwise.""

1098,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 28, 2019 09:39PM ET</span>",Tesla rolls out insurance in California,"By Suzanne Barlyn and Tamara Mathias
(Reuters) - Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) said on Wednesday it was launching an insurance service designed to give drivers in California, its biggest market, lower rates because of safety features on its electric vehicles.
Chief Executive Elon Musk has been one of the strongest proponents of the idea that car insurance rates should plummet as driver-assist and self-driving technology become standard. Tesla said rates of its new plan were as much as 20% lower than those of rivals but did not provide comparisons.
The company did not name an insurance partner, but the California Department of Insurance website showed Tesla was licensed as a broker to conduct business on behalf of the State National Insurance Company Inc, a unit of  Markel Corp  (N:MKL).
Tesla has said its Model 3 sedan had the lowest probability of injury of vehicles tested by the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. The agency responded that Tesla was making ""misleading statements"" and last October sent the company a cease-and-desist letter over the claims.
The company’s cars generally rank among the most expensive vehicles to insure due to their high repair costs for components and sensor equipment, according to safety researchers and insurance providers.
A 2018 review by financial research provider 24/7 Wall St., analyzing claim frequency and insurance cost data by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, ranked the Tesla Model S and Model X at the top of the list of most expensive vehicles to insure.
Representatives of State National Insurance Company did not immediately return calls and emails requesting comment. 
Tesla said it would offer “comprehensive coverage” and claims processing to customers in California, and that it would expand to additional U.S. states in the future.
State National filed an application for the Tesla program in November 2018, which California regulators approved in April.
The use of data from vehicles and consumers will allow for lower costs to attract and service insurance customers, State National wrote in a memorandum that was part of the application. 
Data from Tesla vehicles, when in autonomous mode, “will decrease the frequency and severity of collision claims for Tesla owners,” a factor that State National said will allow it to offer insurance at a lower cost.

Its insurance pricing also cuts out certain fees that traditional insurers charge, Tesla said. The nature of those fees is unclear.

1099,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 28, 2019 08:33PM ET</span>",Stocks to rise as rate cuts beat back trade worries for now: Reuters poll,"By Vivek Mishra and Rahul Karunakar
BENGALURU (Reuters) - World stocks will keep rising over the coming year, according to the latest Reuters polls of strategists, but wild gyrations are likely in the lift from expected central bank policy easing and drag from developments in the U.S.-China trade war.
Fears of a global economic slowdown as the world's largest economies become more deeply locked in a tit-for-tat trade tariff war unnerved world stocks last year, with all the indexes polled by Reuters, barring India and Brazil, in the red in 2018.
While stocks have recovered globally so far this year, the latest polls of nearly 300 equity strategists showed nine of the 17 indexes polled on would not recoup last year's heavy losses by end-2019.
When asked on the probability of a significant correction in equity markets this year, strategists gave a median 30% chance of that happening.
But by the end of 2020 most of those indexes will have recovered 2018's losses and more as nearly 80% of strategists in response to an additional question said the current global monetary easing path will help equities.
""Our cautiousness on the outlook for equities suggests reducing risk ahead of what looks like another – possibly significant or more than 10% – drawdown. But we also caution against the urge to take too many chips off the table,"" said Julien Lafargue, head of equity strategy at  Barclays  (LON:BARC).
""Going against central banks has been a losing strategy for years and this is unlikely to change. While the long lasting impact of quantitative easing and negative interest rates is questionable, from a short-term equity market perspective, there is no doubt their effect is positive.""
A breakdown of predictions reflected the margin of gains in stock markets over the coming year to be directly proportional to how much interest rate ammunition is available for respective central banks.
While European indexes were forecast to gain some ground next year they were expected to lag other developed economies where benchmark interest rates were still positive.
In Asia, excluding Japan, stock prices are expected to continue their rise and recover lost ground with double-digit cumulative gains from 2018 close predicted over the coming year.
The volatile Brazilian Bovespa index was expected to surge ahead nearly 34% by end-2020 from here and Mexican shares were poised to gain nearly 14% for the same period.
Still, not only have strategists trimmed their forecasts for where most indexes polled will trade by end-2019 and mid-2020 compared with predictions made just three months ago, over 70% of respondents said the risks to their outlook were more pessimistic.
U.S. benchmark stock gains have probably neared their ceiling as economic growth risks from the trade war are expected to gnaw at investors and limit the benefits from the Federal Reserve's policy easing.
That clearly reflects nervousness in financial markets based on the inverted U.S. yield curve - which has historically been a highly accurate predictor of a U.S. recession.
""It is very delicately poised. But our view is that the recessionary warnings we are currently seeing prompt a large scale reaction from central banks and politicians,"" noted Rory McPherson, head of investment strategy at Psigma Investment Management.
""This, combined with the record low yields offered by the bond markets, likely pushes investors into the 'pain trade' of owning stocks.""
When asked how long the bull run in global stocks would last, strategists were split, with only about a quarter predicting it to have already ended. Over one-third said it would end within a year but the remaining 40% said predicted over a year.
""While we can see many potential sources of downside risk, our concern is somewhat offset by the fact that most of these themes are now widely recognised and somewhat priced-in,"" noted Paul O'Connor, head of the multi-asset team at Janus Henderson.
""While economic and corporate fundamentals are shaky and global policy uncertainty still overshadows the market outlook, we do take some comfort from the fact that positioning and sentiment in equities is already pretty gloomy.""

1100,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 28, 2019 08:24PM ET</span>",Icahn opposes new directors chosen by Occidental CEO,"By Gary McWilliams
HOUSTON (Reuters) - Activist investor Carl Icahn, who has launched a proxy fight to win seats on Occidental Petroleum's (N:OXY) board, said on Wednesday he opposed efforts by the Houston-based company to name new directors without picking from his slate.
Icahn cited a Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) analyst's report published on Monday that quoted CEO Vicki Hollub as saying the oil producer's board planned to make governance changes, including the appointment of two ""qualified"" directors. 
Occidental had previously dismissed his candidates as inadequate. 
The activist investor owns nearly $2 billion in shares of oil and gas producer Occidental, and last month launched a battle to remove four Occidental directors and replace them with his own, four-person slate. 
On Wednesday, he blasted Hollub for looking for directors ""anywhere but in our direction,"" asking in an open letter to shareholders why his candidates had not been considered.
A spokesman for Occidental did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
""We're going to keep fighting them,"" said Icahn in an interview on Wednesday. ""Unless we get on the board, we're not going away until the annual meeting"" next year, he said.
Icahn, who continues to seek support for a consent solicitation, predicted he would get 20% of Occidental shareholders to call on the company to set a record date for a vote.
""We have proposed four highly-qualified director candidates,"" Icahn said in his letter. His slate includes two executives of his hedge fund, the former finance chief of a U.S. consumer products company, and the former president of Royal Dutch Shell's (L:RDSa) U.S. arm. 
Occidental completed a $38 billion purchase of rival Anadarko Petroleum (NYSE:APC) this month, a deal that Icahn had opposed, calling it ""hugely overpriced.""
He criticized the firm's existing directors for failing to give shareholders a say on the purchase. He has claimed Occidental pursued Anadarko to avoid becoming a takeover candidate.
A suit against Occidental, seeking documents on its pursuit of Anadarko and deal with Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) Corp will be heard in a Delaware court next month, he said.
Berkshire committed $10 billion to bankroll the Occidental-Anadarko deal on terms that Icahn said were too favorable to Berkshire.

Car demand has been hit by a number of factors in recent months including a slump in sales of diesel vehicles in Europe and weakening demand in China, the world's biggest automotive market.
Last month, British car factories churned out 108,239 cars, hit by a 14.6% drop in exports, which account for four in five vehicles, whilst production for domestic demand rose 10.2%, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) said.
""The sector is overwhelmingly reliant on exports and the global headwinds are strong, with escalating trade tensions, softening demand and significant technological change,"" said SMMT Chief Executive Mike Hawes.

ZURICH (Reuters) -  Credit Suisse  (S:CSGN) said on Monday it would invest hundreds of millions of francs in digital services and other parts of its Swiss division by the end of 2021 and said it no longer needed a bigger branch network in its home market than its rivals.
Banks across Europe have been closing branches and cutting tens of thousands of jobs as customers go online and banks seek to save on their bricks-and-mortar costs.
""The achievement of long-term success will not depend on having the biggest branch network in the future,"" Thomas Gottstein, head of Credit Suisse's Swiss Universal Bank (SUB) unit, said without elaborating on any branch closures.
""Instead, having the best digital offering – combined with access to advice from any location and the best service quality – will be the deciding factor,"" he said in a statement.
The Zurich-based bank is creating a new business area, called Direct Banking, for retail and commercial clients, starting on Sept. 1 while carving out its Swiss investment banking operations into a separately managed unit. 
In total, investments ""in the high three-digit million range"" through 2021 will include boosting the Swiss unit's digital offering, hiring client advisers, marketing and sponsorships, Credit Suisse said.
Beyond digital services, Credit Suisse said it planned increased telephone advisory services and ""the provision of personal advice in the regional network of branches"". 
More details about the new branch concept would be provided in the first half of 2020, the bank said.
Credit Suisse's new Direct Banking would have about 1 million retail clients, 60,000 commercial clients, and more than 500 employees and would be run by Mario Crameri, Credit Suisse said. 
YOUTH, RETAIL LAG
""Credit Suisse's market share tends to be lower in Swiss retail banking and among young bank clients than in most other client segments,"" it said. 
""Against this backdrop, Credit Suisse has decided to adjust the business model of its Swiss division and to make substantial investments.""
The bank said it also planned investment in digital solutions for areas with a strong advisory focus, particularly for wealthy clients, entrepreneurs, companies and institutional clients.
The Swiss division is sticking with financial targets communicated at Credit Suisse's 2018 investor day: above-market growth in revenue and client business volume, a cost-to-income ratio of less than 60%, further profitable growth over the medium term and a return on regulatory capital of more than 18%. 
The Swiss Universal Bank, which in 2015 was targeted for a now-shelved partial IPO as Credit Suisse sought to raise cash, has increased its pre-tax income from to 2.2 billion Swiss francs ($2.26 billion) in 2018, from 1.6 billion francs, over the last three years. 

The cost/income ratio improved from 68% to 58% over the period, Credit Suisse said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. money market fund assets fell this week, retreating from their highest level since October 2009, suggesting a pause in investors piling into these low-risk products amid trade and economic worries, a private survey released on Wednesday showed.
Assets of money funds, which are seen nearly as safe as bank accounts, decreased by $12.24 billion to $3.316 trillion in the week ended Aug. 27, the Money Fund Report said on Wednesday.
This reduced the year-to-date increase in money fund assets to $345 billion.
Taxable money market fund assets declined by $11.30 billion to $3.181 trillion, while tax-free fund assets fell by $940.00 million to $134.75 billion, according to the report, published by iMoneyNet.
Money funds are offering investors higher yields than most Treasury maturities. They would fall if the Federal Reserve reduces borrowing costs further to counter a softening global economy and trade tensions between China and the United States.
The Fed cut interest rates for the first time since 2008 in July.
The iMoneyNet average seven-day simple yield for taxable money funds slipped to 1.75%, the lowest level since October, from 1.79% the previous week. The weighted average maturity among taxable funds lengthened by one day to 31 days.
The iMoneyNet average seven-day yield for tax-free and municipal funds edged up to 0.97% from 0.96%. The weighted average maturity of tax-free funds increased three days to 32 days.
On Wednesday, the yields on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes (US10YT=RR) were 1.459%, within striking distance of a three-year low set on Monday, while two-year yields (US2YT=RR) sipped to 1.498%, hovering above near two-year trough reached earlier this week.
Only the longest U.S. Treasury securities are yielding higher than money funds. The 30-year bond yield (US30YT=RR) was 1.930%."

(Reuters) -  Fitbit Inc  (N:FIT) on Wednesday launched its latest smartwatch, Versa 2, adding Amazon.com Inc's (O:AMZN) voice assistant Alexa, online payments and music storage in a bid to compete strongly with Apple Inc's (O:AAPL) smartwatches.
Shares of Fitbit rose as much as 5.6% to $3.01.
Pre-orders for Versa 2, which is priced at $200, will start later in the day, the company said, adding that the smartwatch would be available in stores on Sept. 15.
Fitbit has struggled to gain a foothold in the smartwatch category as Apple and Samsung (KS:005930) have cornered a bigger share of the market with more sophisticated devices, while its dominant share of the fitness tracking sector continues to be chipped away by cheaper offerings from China's Huawei and  Xiaomi  (HK:1810), among others. 
Fitbit last month cut its 2019 revenue forecast, blaming disappointing sales of Versa Lite smartwatches, a cheaper version that lacked features such as the ability to store music.
""While Versa Lite received good present consumer reviews, we saw that consumers were willing to pay more for a smartwatch with additional features,"" Chief Executive Officer James Park said on an earnings call with analysts earlier this month.
The company separately launched Fitbit Premium, which will give its users personalized coaching including health reports, workouts and sleep features at a cost of $9.99 per month, beginning September.
Versa 2 and Fitbit Premium are steps to upsell to its existing base of 27 million users by adding more features, according to Scott Searle from Roth Capital Partners.
Searle added that Fitbit Premium provides sleep guidance and insights enabled by 10.5 billion nights of sleep data gathered from its previous models that give it an edge over Apple's watches.
Fitbit provides five days of battery life on an average against Apple's watches that only have a day of battery life and loses sleep data as it is charged overnight, he added.
The San Francisco-based wearables pioneer, which has seen its shares sink in the past two years, has been looking for new avenues to boost sales. 

Last week, it signed a contract with the Singapore government to provide fitness trackers and services in a health program it said could reach up to 1 million users.

(Reuters) - Apple Inc (O:AAPL) on Wednesday said it would quit its default practice of retaining audio recordings of the requests users make to its Siri personal assistant and limit human review of what audio it does collect to its own employees rather than contractors.
The changes come after Apple earlier this month paused a program called Siri grading in which humans listened to audio recordings of users to determine whether the assistant had responded appropriately to requests to do things like read unread messages or upcoming calendar appointments. 
Apple put the program on hold after the Guardian newspaper reported that contractors working on Apple's behalf regularly heard confidential information, drug deals and couples having sex.
Increased public and political scrutiny of data privacy practices have forced greater transparency from Silicon Valley companies, with Alphabet Inc's (O:GOOGL) Google pausing reviews of audio recordings from its Google assistant service for all purposes in all languages after a leak of Dutch audio data.
Apple has promoted its privacy practices in an effort to distance itself from its rivals and has taken steps since Siri's introduction in 2011 to limit data collection. Audio recordings are deleted after a set period of time, users were identified by a random number, and data such as a user's unread messages or calendar appointments were not sent to Apple's servers.
But Apple tapped humans to improve the service, a process that the company's researchers have in the past told Reuters https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apple-siri-idUSKBN16G0H3 can cut speech recognition error rates in half. Apple says the number of audio recordings reviewed was small - less than 0.2% of total requests - but users had no way to opt out of having audio retained and reviewed by humans except turning Siri off altogether.
Apple on Wednesday said that it will quit keeping audio for human review and instead let users opt in to having their audio reviewed if they choose. The company said it will still use computer-generated transcripts to improve Siri.
Apple also said that it will let only employees review the audio and that it ""will work to delete any recording which is determined to be an inadvertent trigger of Siri."" 

Apple said the pause on the program will remain in place until the changes are carried out but did not give a date.

1108,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 28, 2019 06:24PM ET</span>","U.S. judge rules for Regeneron, Sanofi in Amgen cholesterol drug patent fight","By Jan Wolfe
(Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Wednesday set aside a jury verdict that found  Amgen Inc  (O:AMGN) patents on its cholesterol drug Repatha were valid, handing a victory to Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc (O:REGN) and Sanofi SA (PA:SASY), which sells a rival drug.
The ruling from U.S. District Judge Richard Andrews in Wilmington, Delaware was the latest reversal of fortune in a long-running lawsuit in which Amgen is seeking to stop French drugmaker Sanofi and U.S. biotech Regeneron from selling their drug Praluent.
Repatha and Praluent won U.S. approval about two weeks apart in July of 2016. Both drugs dramatically lower ""bad"" LDL cholesterol by blocking a protein known as PCSK9 that prevents LDL removal from the blood. The injected drugs were later shown to also cut the risk of heart attacks. 
The judge, in setting aside the jury's verdict reached in February, said some patent claims by Amgen relating to antibodies targeting PCSK9 were invalid because they did not sufficiently disclose the Thousand Oaks, California-based company's claimed innovations. 
""It has been our longstanding belief that all of Amgen's asserted U.S. PCSK9 patent claims are invalid, and we are pleased that today's decision reaffirms this,"" Sanofi and Regeneron said in a statement. 
California-based Amgen said in a statement that it disagreed with aspects of the court’s decision and will seek review by the appellate court.
""Protecting intellectual property is critical to our business since it allows for our investment in the research and development of new medicines,"" Amgen said. ""Consequently, we are disappointed with today's decision, and we look forward to presenting our case to uphold the jury's verdict.""
Despite initial forecasts for multibillion-dollar sales, restrictions placed by insurers on use of the potent but expensive drugs have severely limited patient access and sales.
Repatha had worldwide sales of $152 million in the second quarter of 2019, while Regeneron reported Praluent sales of $73.7 million for the period.

CHICAGO (Reuters) - U.S. Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue ordered an investigation into widening prices between cattle and beef on Wednesday after a recent fire at a  Tyson Foods  Inc (N:TSN) slaughterhouse in Holcomb, Kansas, shut the plant.
Cattle prices have tanked because the fire temporarily eliminated a key buyer of livestock. Farmers have worried that meat packers such as Tyson, Cargill Inc (CARG.UL) and JBS USA [JBS.UL] would take advantage of the situation by dropping their offering prices.
At the same time, beef prices climbed as buyers for restaurants, food service companies and grocery chains scrambled for meat.
Profit margins for the packers are above $400 per head of cattle slaughtered, up from around $150 before the fire and well above the previous record of $308, according to Denver-based livestock marketing advisory service HedgersEdge.com.
The USDA will investigate whether there is evidence of price manipulation, collusion or other unfair practices, according to a statement.
""If any unfair practices are detected, we will take quick enforcement action,"" Perdue said.
Tyson said it would cooperate with the investigation. The company resumed some limited work at the plant this week, but it will take a few months to repair damage to the roof and equipment inside, according to a statement.
Cargill and JBS did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The North American Meat Institute, an industry group that represents meat companies, said packers acted properly after the fire disrupted beef production.
But the USDA's investigation ""demonstrates the government's understanding of the extreme strain placed on the cattle industry by the plant fire,"" said Jennifer Houston, president of the National Cattlemen’s Beef Association.
A small number of large packers dominate the U.S. beef sector, which has fueled complaints among some farmers about the power of the companies over cattle and beef prices.
The USDA is responding to those concerns with its probe, said Derrell Peel, agricultural economist at Oklahoma State University.
""I don't think they have a choice but to launch an investigation given the backlash out in the country,"" he said.
Still, the beef and cattle markets seemed to act appropriately given the sudden disruption from the fire, Peel said. The plant killed about 6,000 cattle a day, or 5% of the total U.S. slaughter, prior to the fire.

""Markets don't like shocks and so when you get a shock like that, markets take very dramatic actions,"" Peel said.

1111,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 28, 2019 05:53PM ET</span>",Retailers howl as U.S. trade agency locks in 15% tariffs on Sept. 1,"By David Lawder and Rajesh Kumar Singh
WASHINGTON/DECATUR, Ill. (Reuters) - The Trump administration on Wednesday made official its extra 5% tariff on $300 billion in Chinese imports and set collection dates of Sept. 1 and Dec. 15, prompting hundreds of U.S. retail, footwear, toy and technology companies to warn of price hikes.
The U.S. Trade Representative's office said in an official notice https://s3.amazonaws.com/public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2019-18838.pdf that collections of a 15% tariff will begin at 12:01 a.m. EDT (0401 GMT) Sunday on a portion of the list covering over $125 billion of targeted goods from China.
This initial tranche includes smartwatches, Bluetooth headphones, flat panel televisions and many types of footwear.
U.S. Customs and Border Protection will also start collecting a 15% tariff on Dec. 15 on the remainder of the $300 billion list, including cellphones, laptop computers, toys and clothing, USTR said in the Federal Register filing.
U.S. President Donald Trump announced the increase to 15% from 10% last Friday on Twitter, escalating the bitter U.S. China trade war after Beijing hit back with retaliatory tariffs on $75 billion worth of U.S. goods, including crude oil.
A USTR spokesman said on Wednesday that the agency would issue a separate Federal Register notice with details of Trump's planned tariff increase to 30% on $250 billion in goods that have already been hit with a 25% tariff, including procedures for collecting public comments on the move. 
While Trump in recent days has reversed his aggressive China trade rhetoric, that has not translated to a retreat from the planned tariff hikes. It remains unclear whether U.S. and Chinese negotiators will resume in-person talks in September as previously suggested by U.S. officials.
Trump, speaking by phone to a farm trade show audience in Decatur, Illinois, said that he could do a ""quick deal"" with China to boost his 2020 re-election prospects.
But he said, ""That will be the wrong deal,"" adding that he preferred to ""do it in a right way."" He said the latter approach requires a tougher stance and longer negotiations.
Trump added that federal aid to farmers was being funded by tariff collections on Chinese goods.
DIRECT HIT ON CONSUMERS
Hundreds of retailers, footwear companies and business groups urged Trump to scrap the proposed tariffs, warning they would jack up consumer prices and trigger job losses.
More than 200 U.S. footwear companies on Wednesday said the added 15% duties on shoes would come on top of tariffs that already average 11% and reach 67% on some shoes, boosting costs for consumers by $4 billion every year.
 ""Imposing tariffs in September on the majority of all footwear products from China - including nearly every type of leather shoe - will make it impossible for hardworking American individuals and families to escape the harm that comes from these tax increases,"" the companies wrote in a letter to Trump.
Over 160 other business groups, including the National Retail Federation, Retail Industry Leaders Association and Association of Equipment Manufacturers, also urged Trump to postpone the tariffs, warning they would hit Americans in the middle of the busy holiday shopping season.
Global markets remain on edge after the latest flurry of tit-for-tat tariffs, and the lack of firm details on the next round of U.S.-China trade talks. 
U.S. stocks took some solace in the relative calm on the trade front to close modestly higher on thin trading volume. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) closed up 1% helped by financial stocks and the energy sector after industry data showed a fall in U.S. crude oil stockpiles.
INCREASING HARM 
The Trump administration has, for two years, been pushing China to eliminate unfair trade practices and make sweeping changes to its policies on intellectual property protection, forced transfers of technology to Chinese firms, industrial subsidies and market access for U.S. companies.
The trade dispute between the world's two largest economies boiled over in July 2018 into tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars' worth of each other's goods and now threatens to engulf all U.S.-China trade, putting global growth at risk.
""China's most recent response of announcing a new tariff increase on U.S. goods has shown that the current action being taken is no longer appropriate,"" USTR said in its notice announcing the higher tariff rates.
USTR accuses China of ""unfair acts, policies and practices,"" including its retaliatory tariffs and ""concrete steps to devalue its currency,"" allegations denied by Beijing.
The U.S. Treasury earlier this month declared China a currency manipulator.

""In short, instead of addressing the underlying problems, China has increased tariffs and adopted or threatened additional retaliation to further protect the unreasonable acts, policies, and practices identified in the investigation, resulting in increased harm to the U.S. economy,"" USTR said in the notice.

1114,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 28, 2019 05:04PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch,"Investing.com - Three things that could rock the markets tomorrow:
1. U.S. GDP Growth on Show Amid Deluge of Data
An updated reading on second-quarter U.S. economic growth, initial jobless claims, trade data and numbers on pending home sales are all on the calendar tomorrow.
The Bureau of Economic Analysis will report its penultimate reading of second-quarter gross domestic product at 8:30 AM ET (12:30 GMT).
Economists, on average, expect that second-quarter growth slowed to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 2.0% from an initial reading of 2.1%, according to forecasts compiled by Investing.com.
The weekly report on initial jobless claims is also due at 8:30 AM ET.
The forecast of economists polled by Investing.com is for an increase to 215,000, up from 209,000 the prior week. 
At the same time, the Commerce Department is expected to report that the July U.S. goods trade deficit narrowed to $74.0 billion from $74.2 billion in June. 
Housing also will garner attention, with the National Association of Realtors expected to report its monthly measure of pending home sales at 10:00 AM ET.
On average, economists expect that homes under contract to be sold slowed to 0.1% in July from 2.8% the previous month.
2. Eurozone Data Keeps Euro in Focus
EUR/USD may emerge as the currency pair to watch in Thursday’s session as top-tier Germany economic data hits the calendar at a time when many are fearful the EU’s most productive economy is on the brink. 
The first reading on German consumer inflation in August is expected to show a 0.1% fall, compared with a 0.5% increase last month. During the 12 months through August, German CPI is expected to slow to a rate of 1.5% from 1.7% previously. 
On the labor-market front, German unemployment is expected to have increased 4,000 in August from 1,000 the previous month, with the unemployment rate unchanged at 5.0%. 
3.  Best Buy , Abercrombie & Fitch Earnings Due
 Best Buy  (NYSE:BBY) is expected to report second-quarter earnings before the market open Thursday, with many fearing the U.S.-China trade war could hurt margins, keeping a lid on growth. 
The electronics retailer is expected to report earnings of 99 cents a share on revenue of $9.55 billion, according to consensus estimates compiled by Investing.com.
Guidance will also be watched as the threat of tariffs looms, according to Wedbush. 
“We expect management to again reiterate its fiscal 2020 guidance for revenue of $42.9 to 43.9 billion, for enterprise comps of 0.5% to 2.5%, and for earnings per share of $5.45 to $5.65, regardless of upside in the quarter given the looming threat of tariffs” Wedbush said. 
Abercrombie & Fitch (NYSE:ANF) also reports second-quarter earnings before the opening bell. 
The apparel retailer is expected to report earnings of 53 cents a share on revenue of $852.3 million.
The retailer’s ability to generate top-line growth will likely depend on the performance of its Hollister brand, which accounts for 58% of total revenue and has been losing the attention of consumers. 
After its first-quarter results, the retailer said it was closing three big stores including the Hollister location in New York and Abercrombie in Milan and Fukuoka, Japan."
1115,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 28, 2019 05:02PM ET</span>",Stocks - Wall Street Enjoys a Pre-Holiday Rally,"Investing.com - Stocks surged Wednesday as investors appeared relieved there was little rhetoric about trade wars and put their recession worries aside ahead of the Labor Day weekend.
The market gains were produced by rising energy, consumer discretionary and industrial stocks. The indexes more than offset losses suffered on Tuesday.
The Dow Jones industrials  pushed higher because of strength in Boeing (NYSE:BA), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:NYSE:GS),   Home Depot   (NYSE:NYSE:HD), UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:NYSE:UNH) and chemical maker Dow Inc. (NYSE:DOW).
The Dow closed up about 1%, while the S&P 500 added 0.66%. The Nasdaq Composite was up a more modest 0.38% because of weakness in such key tech stocks as Microsoft (NASDAQ:NASDAQ:MSFT), Facebook (NASDAQ:NASDAQ:FB) and Adobe Systems (NASDAQ:NASDAQ:ADBE).
The Dow finished at 26,036, its first close above 26,000 since Thursday. Only three Dow components were lower. One was Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), down 0.7%. It had risen Monday and Tuesday despite a federal judge's order that the pharmaceutical giant pay $572 million in its role in the opioid crisis in Oklahoma. 
The other Dow decliners were Travelers (NYSE:TRV) and Microsoft. Dow Inc. was the leader, up 3.3%, perhaps a rebound from several days of losses.
Energy shares moved higher on the Energy Information Administration's report of a big drawdown of U.S. crude oil inventories. West Texas Intermediate crude was up 85 cents to $55.78 a barrel. Brent, the global benchmark crude, climbed 90 cents to $59.93.
Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) and Apache (NYSE:APA) were among the energy leaders. Dow components   Exxon Mobil   (NYSE:XOM) and   Chevron   (NYSE:CVX) were up 0.7% and 0.9%, respectively.
Retailers had a decent day with gains across a wide spectrum, with Tiffany (NYSE:TIF), Macy’s (NYSE:M), Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN), Kohl's (NYSE:KSS) and Dollar Tree (NASDAQ:DLTR) all winners. 
  Cimarex Energy   (NYSE:XEC), cosmetics company Coty (NYSE:COTY), Diamondback Energy (NASDAQ:FANG) and Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) among the S&P 500 leaders.
Autodesk (NASDAQ:ADSK), network security company   Fortinet   (NASDAQ:FTNT), software developer Ansys (NASDAQ:ANSS) and Adobe Systems (NASDAQ:ADBE) were among the S&P 500 laggards.
Gold futures were off slightly at $1,549.10 an ounce.
Interest rates were lower, with the 10-Year yield at 1.471%. But there was still a yield inversion in place with the 10-2 Year Treasury Yield Spread at negative 3.55 basis points. The inversion is a signal of a possible recession ahead.
Another worrying signal: The yield on the 30-Year bond briefly hit a record low of 1.905%.
The market had fallen at the open in part on news that British Prime Minister Boris Johnson won Queen Elizabeth II's approval to suspend Parliament until mid-October. The news pushed the GBP/USD lower against the dollar.
But the averages recovered later in the morning on the energy-share rally.
Even with today's rally, the major averages are still roughly 5% below their late July peaks and 3% to 3.5% below their peaks in the early fall of 2018 before the pre-Christmas slump."

1117,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 28, 2019 04:36PM ET</span>","Third Point, U.S. settle over antitrust filing in DowDuPont stake","By Svea Herbst-Bayliss
BOSTON (Reuters) - Third Point LLC has agreed to pay more than $600,000 to settle allegations the hedge fund failed to properly file for antitrust clearance when it bought DowDuPont stock two years ago, the U.S. Justice Department said on Wednesday.
Third Point, which invests roughly $15 billion in securities around the world and is run by billionaire investor Daniel Loeb, will pay a civil fine of $609,810, the department said.
Two years ago the hedge fund allegedly bought too much DowDuPont stock too quickly, failing to make the required Hart-Scott-Rodino filings or observe a required waiting period.
The hedge fund could have faced much higher penalties but the Justice Department said it reduced the fine because the ""violation was inadvertent.""
Firms are required to make the Hart-Scott-Rodino filings to give the government time to investigate potential antitrust violations.
Third Point declined to comment.
Third Point's alleged misstep revolved around the August 2017 merger of Dow and DuPont (NYSE:DD) when their separate stocks stopped trading on Aug. 31, 2017 and were replaced by DowDuPont shares, which began trading on Sept. 1, 2017.
Earlier this year Dow Inc was formally spun off from DowDuPont Inc.
Third Point received voting securities of DowDuPont in excess of $80.8 million through the merger, the threshold for making the required filing at that time.
While Third Point properly observed the rules when it bought Dow stock long before the merger in 2014, the Justice Department said that because DowDuPont was a different company, the hedge fund was required to make another filing after the merger.
The government also noted that Third Point had previously violated filing requirements in connection with building a stake in Yahoo (NASDAQ:AABA) Inc shares in 2011."

COPENHAGEN (Reuters) -  Pandora  (CO:PNDORA), the world's biggest jeweler maker, will relaunch its brand at an event in Los Angeles later on Wednesday as it tries to attract middle-class shoppers seeking affordable luxury back to its stores.
The Denmark-based company, best known for its customisable silver charm bracelets, will completely revamp the design of its 2,700 shops worldwide, unveil a new logo, increase marketing campaigns featuring celebrities and launch themed collections, including Harry Potter and Walt Disney's Frozen.
Pandora's sales increased more than 10-fold in the decade to 2017 as it found a relatively unoccupied market niche between cheaper accessories found in stores like H&M (ST:HMb) and more expensive jewelry such as that from  Tiffany & Co . (N:TIF)
But a lack of innovation and overstretching itself at both the top and bottom end of the market has kept both shoppers and investors at bay recently.
""Customers tell us they used to think of Pandora as affordable but don't any more. The brand has drifted away from its original position and now we're trying to move it back to what made Pandora,"" Chief Executive Alexander Lacik told Reuters in an interview this week.
""We have to strengthen our position as an affordable jewelry brand big time,"" he said.
Lacik took the helm at Pandora, which sold 280,000 pieces of jewelry per day in 2018, in April after the former CEO was ousted last year after several profit warnings.
Investors have generally welcomed Pandora's new strategy, which was launched at the beginning of the year and focuses on cost savings, improved brand positioning and less promotions.
Pandora's stock has risen 10% since the beginning of the year to 296 Danish crowns ($44.24) a share, still a far cry from a 2016 peak of more than 1,000 crowns.
The firm said it will start using more ""influencers"" and celebrities to entice young shoppers. The use of Colombian pop singer Shakira to promote jewelry in Latin America had been positive, it has said.
The company will showcase a bigger variety of its jewelry in its stores, allowing shoppers to see and touch the products, while also refreshing the online experience on marketplaces like China's Tmall.
""We hope to drive a much more interesting interaction with the shoppers,"" said Lacik."

The retail company has been selling businesses and closing stores over the past few years to focus on luxury department store chain Saks Fifth Avenue and Hudson's Bay in Canada to shore up its finances as shoppers skip brick-and-mortar stores to shop online instead. 
Le Tote will pay Hudson's Bay C$99.5 million ($74.95 million) in cash when the deal closes and another C$33.2 million ($25.01 million) in cash after two years. Hudson's Bay will receive a 25% equity stake in Le Tote and two seats on the company's board.
""It allows us to focus on Saks and its upside potential,"" said Hudson's Bay Chief Executive Helena Foulkes, adding that the company is simplifying and streamlining Hudson's Bay. 
Hudson's Bay's shares rose nearly 2% on the news.
The deal with Le Tote comes months after Hudson's Bay Executive Chairman Richard Baker offered to take the Canadian retailer private in a C$1.74 billion deal.
A special committee of Hudson's Bay's board said Baker's offer for the company was ""inadequate,"" while shareholders, who must approve the deal, have opposed it because it does not provide enough value.
Hudson's Bay's sale of the Lord + Taylor business is the latest of several divestitures. The retailer announced in 2017 it would sell Lord + Taylor's Manhattan flagship to co-working space manager The WeWork Company. 
Earlier this year, Hudson's Bay sold its remaining stake in its German real estate venture for C$1.5 billion.
APPAREL RENTAL
Lord + Taylor has seen its fortunes fall while Saks Fifth Avenue has managed to increase sales.
Under the deal, Le Tote will acquire the Lord + Taylor brand and related intellectual property, while assuming operations of 38 stores, Lord + Taylor's digital channels and the associated inventory.
Le Tote will set up drop-off points for its apparel rental business in the stores, in its first move into bricks and mortar, said Chief Executive Rakesh Tondon.
Le Tote will use its technology to improve product recommendations and personalized shopping experiences at Lord + Taylor, he said.
""We want to keep the Lord & Taylor brand (and) energize it, (but) not change too much too quickly,"" Tondon said. 
Apparel rental is a small but fast-growing part of the struggling clothing sector, with retailers like Bloomingdale's (N:M) and Banana Republic (N:GPS) launching subscription services this month alone.
Le Tote competitor Rent the Runway entered a deal with Nordstrom (N:JWN) in June to install 'drop-off boxes' in Nordstrom stores for customers to return rented clothing.

1120,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 28, 2019 03:48PM ET</span>",Here's Where Capital Flight From Hong Kong Will Show Up First,"(Bloomberg) -- It’s one of the biggest questions hanging over Hong Kong as anti-government protests head into a 13th week: Will investors pull their money out?
So far, there are few signs of a mass exodus. But the risk of capital outflows is undoubtedly rising as Hong Kong’s summer of unrest pushes the economy toward a recession, weighs on asset prices and fuels doubt about the city’s future as a financial hub.
The stakes are high for Hong Kong, which is one of the world’s most open economies, with bank assets equal to about 8.5 times of its GDP and offshore traders accounting for about 40% of volume on the city’s stock market. That means a significant withdrawal of deposits and investors would land a heavy blow to its economy and markets.
While the city has periodically experienced sustained bouts of outflows -- notably during the global financial crisis and the SARS epidemic -- there’s no single indicator that shows how money is moving in and out of the territory. The trends in those periods were evident in stock market and real estate slumps, along with a variety of metrics that, taken together, help tell the whole story.
Here’s what they’re showing today:
Aggregate Balance
Changes in the aggregate balance of interbank liquidity -- bank funds held with the Hong Kong Monetary Authority -- are among the most visible indicators of fund-flow pressures. The balance recently dropped to HK$54 billion ($6.9 billion) from about HK$180 billion after HKMA used funds to defend the currency peg -- a move that Kevin Lai, chief economist for Asia excluding Japan at Daiwa Capital Markets Ltd., said may have had more to do with the period when the U.S. Federal Reserve was raising interest rates.
Foreign Currency Assets
Changes in the level of foreign currency assets held by Hong Kong’s banks are another proxy for capital flows. The city has already seen a decline of more than $45 billion since mid-2017 as the Fed tightened monetary policy, according to Daiwa’s Lai. He estimates Hong Kong has a buffer of nearly $140 billion before it runs into a liquidity crisis that would trigger a surge in banks’ borrowing costs.
Interbank Rates
Another closely watched measure is the local lending rate between Hong Kong’s banks, known as Hibor. If it’s higher than borrowing costs in U.S. dollars for a sustained period (say, more than a month) that would hint at outflows, said Tommy Ong, managing director for treasury and markets at DBS Hong Kong Ltd. As money exits the financial system, liquidity gets tighter and interest rates rise.
Hong Kong dollar interest rates have mostly been lower than U.S. borrowing costs, though they were briefly higher in late June and early July due to seasonal factors.
Deposits
A meaningful decrease in Hong Kong dollar deposits would suggest investors are switching their local assets into other currencies. Bank customers in Hong Kong held HK$13.6 trillion in deposits as of June, HKMA data show, a slight decrease from earlier in the year but still near a record high.
“The risk is contained at the moment,” said Carie Li, an economist at OCBC Wing Hang Bank Ltd. in Hong Kong. “But ongoing protests, the yuan and the trade war are causing concern.”
Stock Links
Hong Kong’s stock-exchange links with mainland China provide a daily look at cross-border capital flows. For now, mainland investors are hunting for bargains as Hong Kong stocks fall: They added a net $8.4 billion to their holdings in the 28 trading sessions through Tuesday.
Hong Kong Dollar
For many economies, a falling currency can be a sign of investors heading for the exits -- think of the British pound’s decline amid Brexit uncertainties. Weakness in the Hong Kong dollar can also reflect capital outflows, but the currency’s usefulness as an indicator is limited because it has been pegged to the U.S. dollar since 1983.
The city’s de-facto central bank says it’s committed to keeping the currency in a tight trading range between HK$7.75 to HK$7.85 against the greenback. If the rate neared the bottom end, expectations of HKMA intervention would likely lead to a spike in borrowing costs, a move that would force traders to quit their short positions and trigger a spike in the exchange rate.
Share Prices
Hong Kong has the world’s fourth-biggest stock market by value, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Share prices in the city have dipped during previous crises as investors have fled, though the city’s bourse was a fraction of its current size.
Though the data don’t show signs of significant outflows, Hong Kong’s political and business leaders have warned of lasting economic damage to the city. That could also mean fleeing money, according to economists at Natixis SA.
“If the negative sentiment continues, the rapidly decelerating economic environment could entice capital outflows,” they wrote in a note published Wednesday."

Sovereign bond prices fell as much as 7%, with euro-denominated notes trading around 40 cents per euro and the dollar-denominated century bonds at the weakest level on record near 43 cents on the dollar. The peso weakened as much as 4.2% before paring losses as officials intervened in the market.
Investors are taking an increasingly dim view of the country just as a team from the IMF visits Buenos Aires to determine whether to disburse the next tranche of its $56 billion credit line. A refusal could spark renewed capital flight and bring about default. An agreement would enable Argentina to live to fight another day. The team’s recommendation should be known within the next few weeks.
“Argentina needs the $5.3 billion disbursement to make debt payments by year-end,” said Carolina Gialdi, a senior fixed-income strategist at BTG Pactual Argentina in Buenos Aires. “If they don’t disburse, the government will need to use international reserves to repay dollar debt.”
Yet reserves are already falling fast as people pull their money out of the country, with the cache down more than $10 billion over the past month to $57.5 billion.
Argentina’s credit default swaps imply an 89% probability of a default within five years, according to CMA data.
Running Mate
The central bank is seeking to limit demand for dollars by telling financial institutions to hold off on peso loans to exporters, who would then buy greenbacks, according to a statement Wednesday.
More drama was inserted into the market Wednesday morning when President Mauricio Macri’s running mate in the October election said the government is considering measures to halt capital flight. Argentina isn’t planning to announce any new economic measures in the short term, according to the Economy Ministry’s press office.
“I am convinced that they are going to take measures that provide stability to the economy and fundamentally to stop dollars flowing out,” Miguel Angel Pichetto told Radio Metro.
Pichetto added that he believed the opposition was lobbying to block the disbursement from the IMF. Opposition candidate Alberto Fernandez criticized the IMF accord yesterday, saying the Fund and Macri were now responsible for getting the country out of the economic crisis.
Central Bank
The central bank is taking increasingly drastic action to defend the peso. It sold $367 on the currency market Wednesday and $302 million the day before, according to a people with knowledge of the matter.
While the markets tumble, Argentines are taking to the streets. Tens of thousands joined protests across the country on Wednesday demanding the government take measures to mitigate the impact of the economic crisis.
The peso has slumped more than 20% since the opposition unexpectedly routed Macri in a primary election on Aug. 11 ahead of the election proper on Oct. 27.
“It appears that the political harmony created by an implicit agreement between Macri and Fernandez is fading fast,”  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) strategists including Dirk Willer and Kenneth Lam wrote on a Wednesday report. “Volatility is going to be high into the election.”

1122,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 28, 2019 03:46PM ET</span>",Apple to Start Online Sales in India After Country Eases Rules,"(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). is poised to start online sales of its devices in India within months, a person familiar with the matter said, benefiting from new rules making the world’s fastest-growing smartphone market more attractive to foreign brands.
On Wednesday, India eased rules that forced companies such as Apple to source 30% of their production locally -- a requirement the iPhone maker has been lobbying against for years -- to include exports as part of the requirement.
That rule posed a problem for electronics brands because most of its devices and components are manufactured in China. The government also allowed so-called single brand retailers to set up online stores before physical shops.
With escalating trade tensions damaging ties between the U.S. and China, New Delhi’s latest investment rules could provide a boost to Apple, allowing it to grow sales in the country and possibly help it reduce its high dependency on China by building out an alternative supply chain in India.
The Cupertino-based device and services company will begin selling its iPhone, iPads and Apple Mac computers online in the coming months. It’s also firming up the Mumbai location of its first company-owned brick & mortar store in India -- likely to open next year -- the person said, asking not to be identified as the details are confidential. Selling online will be a big step forward for Apple in a country where counterfeit products abound in online platforms increasing buyers’ distrust.
Apple didn’t immediately respond to an email seeking comments.
Some of the phone maker’s older devices are assembled by Taiwanese contractor Wistron Corp. in a factory in Bangalore, while the world’s largest contract manufacturer, Foxconn Technology Group, tests assembly of Apple’s latest iPhone X in a factory near Chennai.
Apple has an insignificant share of the India’s booming smartphone market as its high prices and hefty import tariffs of as much as 20% put its products beyond the reach of average Indians. Sales of the iconic iPhones slid dramatically in 2018 and early 2019, forcing the phone maker to offer steep discounts on even its latest models.
India with 1.3 billion people is the last remaining large market for smartphone makers, and the new rules pave the way for Apple to control its own retailing and branding, both online and offline. Currently, it sells through franchisee stores and via online retail platforms such as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) India and Walmart-owned Flipkart Online Services Pvt.
India’s online retail market is surging and smartphones account for a chunk of e-commerce companies’ sales. Over a fifth of the phones sold in the country are through online channels and through direct sales, Apple could win greater customer loyalty and even out the playing field with Chinese brands such as Xiaomi and OnePlus, which have gained popularity in the market on aggressive online selling strategies."
1123,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 28, 2019 03:44PM ET</span>",Bond Income Helps India Central Bank Pay Record Windfall,"(Bloomberg) -- Terms of Trade is a daily newsletter that untangles a world embroiled in trade wars. Sign up here. 
The Reserve Bank of India’s record payout to the government turns the focus back to the central bank’s profits and how it can afford such a massive transfer.
Almost 70% of the 1.76 trillion-rupee ($24.5 billion) disbursement -- which was approved by the RBI on Monday -- is derived from the income the central bank earned on its investments, likely gains from changes to accounting of its foreign exchange policy and the fees it gets from printing notes and minting coins. The rest, about 526 billion rupees, comes from its surplus capital.
The RBI’s annual report for the year ended June 30, due to be released Thursday, will throw more light on how it managed to boost its income. Some analysts say its due to the central bank’s debt strategy, which made it the largest buyer of government securities last year.
“The reason for this is the record open market bond purchases in the financial year to March 2019,” said Pranjul Bhandari, chief India economist at  HSBC Holdings  Plc (LON:HSBA). in Mumbai. “It led to a high interest income.”
Central banks generally buy and sell government bonds as part of normal monetary operations, affecting liquidity in the market by boosting or withdrawing cash into the system. In India, where a shadow banking crisis has caused a cash crunch, the RBI has been purchasing bonds to inject more funds into money markets.
Bhandari estimates the government bought 3 trillion rupees of bonds in the market in the fiscal year through March, making up more than 70% of sovereign bond issuance.
The windfall from the central bank couldn’t have come at a better time for Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who is under pressure to halt a sharp slowdown in the economy. The money gives New Delhi more fiscal options, including possibly lowering its market borrowings or boosting spending to shore up growth.
The RBI payout this year represents two parts: dividends and a capital transfer. The central bank pays dividends to the government every year, based on the profit from its investments and printing of notes and coins. It also holds substantial foreign securities in its investment portfolio, but interest income from that is seen lower than its domestic holdings because local rates are higher compared to those in the U.S., U.K or Japan.
The dividend of 1.23 trillion rupees is double the amount that had been transferred in recent years, and represents the entire net income of the RBI for the year ended June.
The capital transfer of 526.4 billion rupees is based on the recommendations of a panel set up to study how much excess capital the central bank holds.
The panel recommended, among other things, that the RBI’s economic capital -- made up of realized equity and revaluation balances -- should lie within the range of 20% to 24.5% of its balance sheet. It prescribed maintaining the realized equity -- or contingency buffer-- between 5.5% to 6.5%.
The RBI board accepted both the recommendations, which took its payout to a record. But economists warned that future payments might not be as huge.
“The committee has lowered the prospect of a sizable transfer of RBI’s reserves over the next few years, as revaluation stores from the RBI’s balance sheet might be excluded from any excess capital calculation,” Radhika Rao, an economist at DBS Group Holdings Ltd. in Singapore, said in a note."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury debt yields fell on Wednesday, with 30-year yields setting all-time lows, as fears about a recession and trade tensions between China and the United States stoked unrelenting demand for low-risk government debt.
Inversion is spreading across the U.S. yield curve, where short-dated yields are running above long-dated ones, which has also unsettled investors as yield curve inversion often precedes a recession.
""A deeper inversion is sending a stronger statement that a meaningful slowdown is coming,"" said Brian Rehling, co-head of global fixed income strategy at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Investment Institute in St. Louis, Missouri. ""A recession is a possibility in the next 12 to 18 months, but it's not a done deal.""

While some fund managers view Treasuries as expensive, they are hard pressed to make a case to sell them given the uncertain outcome of the trade developments between Beijing and Washington.

1126,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 28, 2019 03:06PM ET</span>",Chilean retailers suffer as Argentine tourist numbers fall,"By Fabian Cambero
SANTIAGO (Reuters) - The sight of Argentine tourists filling entire suitcases with goods in Chilean shopping malls is no longer as common as it once was.
In recent years, Argentines have crossed the Andes in huge numbers to take advantage of a favorable exchange rate and Chile's more open economy to shop for clothing, footwear and technology that often sells for less than half the price than in stores at home.
But with the Argentine peso tumbling and economic crisis at home deepening, visits by Argentines to Chile have fallen sharply. Visits dropped nearly 50 percent in the first half of this year to 887,769 people, compared to 1.63 million in the same period of 2018, official figures from the department of tourism showed.
Tourist numbers dropped 20 percent in July alone, year-on-year.
""The situation in Argentina is impacting the entire region,"" Chile's Tourism Undersecretary Monica Zalaquett told Reuters.
Since many were on ""shopping tourism"" trips, the drop was also reflected in a decline in spending on international credit cards in Chile, which fell by 11.5 percent between January and June 2019, according to government figures.
""We traveled because we had already bought the tickets, but we are trying to spend as little as possible,"" said Silvana Blanco, a Buenos Aires office worker restricting herself to window shopping at Santiago's large Costanera Center last weekend.
Earlier this month, Peronist opposition candidate Alberto Fernandez drubbed incumbent President Mauricio Macri in primary elections ahead of a general election in October.
That led to another tumble in the peso - and more bad news for Santiago store owners. A year ago, one Argentine peso could buy 22 of its Chilean counterparts. This week, it was worth around 13.
Among tourists in Chile, Argentines have traditionally been the biggest spenders, followed by Brazilians.
""The Argentine market represents 40-45 percent of tourist visits to Chile,"" said Lorena Arriagada, general secretary of the Chilean Association of Tourism Companies.
""I think those that felt this most were the shopping centers.""
Santiago's Chamber of Commerce said it hoped Argentine shoppers would still spend $550 million this year - 0.7 percent of retail sales, compared to 1.3 percent in 2016 and 2017.
The drop in cross-Andean visitors had ""obviously affected growth in the sector and complicated the scenario,"" said George Lever, the chamber of commerce's head of studies.
 Cencosud  (SN:CENCOSUD) and  Falabella  (SN:FALABELLA), Chile's largest retail and shopping center operators, declined to comment."

Investing.com – Short-term rates remained higher than long-term rates Wednesday, but investors may be getting over their yield-curve inversion aversion as equities climb.

The most-watched spread between the 10/2-year Treasury yields narrowed very slightly in afternoon trading, but remained firmly in negative territory at negative 4 basis points.

Maybe even more troubling for rate-watchers, 3-month Treasuries are paying more than 30-year Treasuries, with the 30-year bond yield hitting record lows again.
That’s a situation Investing.com Analyst Clement Thibault called “obviously insane.”
But stocks rallied in the afternoon, gaining steam in the absence of any more negative U.S.-China trade headlines and financial stocks bouncing back.

In comparison to bond yields, among the top income payers in the Dow Jones Industrial Average,  Exxon Mobil 's (NYSE:XOM) yield is 5.18%,   IBM   (NYSE:IBM) pays 4.94%, Verizon (NYSE:VZ) pays 4.21% and   Pfizer   (NYSE:PFE) pays 4.19%."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks advanced on Wednesday, as gains in financial and energy shares helped equities recover from initial declines, but investors remained cautious about the potential for another flare-up in U.S.-China trade tensions.
The financial sector (SPSY) was up 1.06%, clawing back some of the losses from the previous session triggered by a deepening of the U.S. Treasury yield curve inversion, which often precedes a recession. 
Gains in the benchmark S&P 500 index (SPX) were also supported by a 1.75% jump in energy (SPNY) stocks after industry data showed a fall in stockpiles of U.S. crude, boosting oil prices. 
The two have been the worst performing of the 11 major S&P sectors in August.
""When you look at both financials and energy being among the worst on a relative strength basis, you could say it is a dead cat bounce,"" said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research in New York. 
Investors took some solace in the lack of new developments on the trade front, although the U.S. Trade Representative's office on Wednesday reaffirmed President Donald Trump's plans to impose an additional 5% tariff on a list of $300 billion of Chinese imports starting on Sept. 1 and Dec. 15.
""As the hangman says, no noose is good noose. We are not really hearing anything from the Chinese or from economic data that could really throw us off balance,"" said Stovall. 
Next week, investors will look towards the monthly jobs report and manufacturing data which could guide expectations on the likelihood of another rate cut from the Federal Reserve at its mid-September meeting. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) rose 220.28 points, or 0.85%, to 25,998.18, the S&P 500 (SPX) gained 16.21 points, or 0.56%, to 2,885.37 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) added 20.77 points, or 0.27%, to 7,847.71.
Another factor potentially proving a lift to stocks was the drop in the 30-year U.S. Treasury yield to below that of the S&P 500 dividend yield, making equities a more attractive income alternative. 
Technology stocks (SPLRCT) dipped 0.12%, pressured by declines in shares of  Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT) and  Autodesk Inc  (O:ADSK). 
Shares of the AutoCAD software maker slid 6.9%, the most on the S&P 500, after the company cut its full-year earnings forecast. 
Shares of Tiffany & Co (N:TIF) rose 3.6% after the luxury jeweler reported quarterly earnings above analysts' estimates.
 Coty Inc  (N:COTY) rose 5.1% after the cosmetics maker raised its full-year revenue forecast, betting on a multi-year turnaround plan that involves increased investments in advertising and cost cuts.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co's (N:HPE) shares added 3.4% after the company beat profit estimates and raised its 2019 adjusted earnings forecast.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 2.66-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.31-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

The S&P 500 posted 7 new 52-week highs and 38 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 21 new highs and 144 new lows.

1131,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 28, 2019 01:46PM ET</span>","Privatize Petrobras? Lofty ambition, higher hurdles","By Jamie McGeever
BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil's influential finance minister has convinced President Jair Bolsonaro to consider the once-unthinkable step of privatizing state-owned oil company Petrobras (SA:PETR4), but stiff political opposition could stifle any effort to sell the country's corporate crown jewel.
Petrobras, or Petroleo Brasileiro SA, was founded in 1953 by former president Getulio Vargas following a nationalist campaign that began in the 1940s with the anthem ""The oil is ours"".
Selling the company would cap off the drive by Economy Minister Paulo Guedes, a Chicago school-trained economist and disciple of Thatcherite economics, to maximize privatization, deregulation and free-market activity.
Guedes, who is influential in Bolsonaro's right-wing administration, has said if it were up to him the state would sell ""everything"". But he needs to build support because unlike other state assets, privatizing Petrobras requires congressional approval.
The Brazilian government's stake in Petrobras, including stock owned by development bank BNDES, is worth 135 billion reais ($33 billion) at current market prices.
It is hard to estimate how much a rival would pay for a controlling premium or how much the government could raise from outright privatization. Still, proceeds from a sale would go a long way toward reducing Brazil's budget deficit.
It would also be the clearest signal yet that the government is serious about shrinking the state's size and influence in business. But it is likely to remain a pipe dream, at least over the remaining 3-1/2 years of Bolsonaro's first term.
Petrobras is already raising cash by selling off non-core assets and the government has a long list of other firms it wants to privatize first. Also, politicians of many stripes oppose selling Petrobras, saying it would violate national sovereignty.
""Petrobras is a successful example of a public company ... so I find it hard to make the case that privatizing it will be more profitable for Brazil,"" said federal deputy Marcelo Ramos of the center-right Liberal Party.
""Personally, I am against it and I don't think there will be appetite for this in Congress,"" he said.
EVERYTHING ON THE TABLE
After a dispute about the sale of Petrobras subsidiaries, Brazil's Supreme Court decided in June that congress must approve any sale of the oil company.
Bolsonaro himself has said in the past that he opposed privatizing Petrobras because of its ""strategic"" nature. Last week, he said the government was ready to discuss a possible sale, and shares of Petrobras briefly jumped.
""Everything is studied, everything is raised, everything is discussed,"" Bolsonaro told reporters on Thursday last week. ""Whether you privatize or not, you have to look at the cost-benefit, what is good for Brazil and what is not,"" he said.
A drive to privatize Petrobras ""will embolden the opposition in Congress, which now has more support for its claim that Brazil is being handed over to businessmen and/or foreigners,"" analysts at Guide Investimentos said in a client note last week.
$70 BILLION DEBT
Currently, the government holds a 43% stake - 28% directly and 15% through BNDES - in what is the world's ninth-largest oil company by market capitalization. That is a controlling stake because it is all voting stock, equivalent to 50.3% of common shares, according to information provided by Petrobras to securities industry regulators.
Petrobras employs nearly 70,000 people and is Brazil's largest company by revenue, operating profit and market value. It has taken steps to reduce its huge debt load in recent years, as it began to move beyond the black eye inflicted by its part in the nationwide graft-and- corruption scandal exposed by ""Operation Car Wash.""
But despite unprecedented moves to sell non-core assets, net debt still stands at around $70 billion.
Shares jumped 6% on Wednesday last week after local media reports that the government wants to push a sale through in Bolsonaro's first term, but have since slumped back along with the broader market.
HISTORY LESSON
Last week, the government added nine companies to the list of state-controlled firms to be sold, including postal service Correios and Codesp, the company managing Latin America's largest port in Santos. The government hopes to raise 1.3 trillion reais ($323 billion).
Brazil has turned over state-controlled behemoths to the private sector before. In 1993 it sold steel giant CSN (SA:CSNA3), in 1997 it unloaded miner Vale (SA:VALE3) and in 1998 telecommunications monopoly Telebras was auctioned off.
The Telebras sale might offer an insight into the potential time frame for Petrobras. A change to the country's constitution was made in 1995 and the company was not privatized for another three years.
Brazil's power monopoly Eletrobras (SA:ELET6) also offers a lesson in playing the long game when privatizing Brazil's crown jewels.
Its share price jumped last week when House Speaker Rodrigo Maia said Congress will renew efforts to privatize the company, almost exactly two years after former President Michel Temer announced his desire to privatize it.
An executive at one of the largest international investors that acquired Petrobras assets recently said he did not expect the company to be privatized during Bolsonaro's term, noting that other state assets are much easier to sell.
""Maybe it's a project for the next president,"" he said, requesting anonymity to avoid upsetting government officials, while analysts at XP Investimentos said Petrobras is ""probably a step too far"" right now."

""The trouble is that Slack hasn’t yet shown that companies are adopting it exclusively. As a merely supplemental platform, its benefits have limits,"" the Journal's Lauren Silva Laughlin wrote. 
""Checking yet another form of communication can cause further disruptions at work and cut even more into productivity,"" she added. 
Slack Technologies (NYSE:WORK) fell 1.8% to $29.37, though it had been trading as low as $28.50.
Slack went public in June to much fanfare as it rallied 50% above its IPO price of $26, prompting some on Wall Street to suggest that the message platform had warranted a premium valuation. 
""With high gross margins and a clearly sticky product, we're quite confident that (Slack) will grow to be a 30%+ (free cash flow) margin business with scale,” Canaccord Genuity said last month.
The move lower in Slack arrives just a week after the company was buoyed by news that Yale University had acquired a stake.
According to a 13-F securities filing for the second quarter, the university purchased 437,667 shares with a holding value of $16.4 million at the time of filing.
Slack has an average price target of $38.92, according to consensus estimates compiled by Investing.com."

1140,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 28, 2019 12:41PM ET</span>",Over 200 U.S. footwear companies urge Trump to scrap proposed tariff hike,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - More than 200 U.S. footwear companies on Wednesday urged U.S. President Donald Trump to cancel proposed higher tariffs on Chinese imports that take effect beginning next month, calling them hidden taxes that will jack up consumer prices.
""Imposing tariffs in September on the majority of all footwear products from China - including nearly every type of leather shoe - will make it impossible for hardworking American individuals and families to escape the harm that comes from these tax increases,"" the companies wrote in a letter to Trump.
While tariffs on some Chinese imports will be delayed until Dec. 15, the majority of footwear lines face an added 15% tariff on Sept. 1, the letter said. That comes on top of tariffs that already average 11% and reach 67% on some shoes, it added.
""This added 15% tax will cost U.S. footwear consumers an additional $4 billion every year,"" the letter said, citing an estimate by the Footwear Distributors & Retailers of America (FDRA) trade group, which spearheaded the letter.
The letter, signed by companies including Adidas (DE:ADSGn) and  Foot Locker  (N:FL), warned that the new tariffs would exacerbate economic uncertainty and could drive up prices in other countries that produce footwear, given limited production capacities.
The U.S. Trade Representative's Office (USTR) on Wednesday reaffirmed Trump's plans to impose an additional 5% tariff on a $300 billion list of Chinese imports starting Sept. 1 and Dec. 15. The Trump administration had previously planned to impose a 10% tariff on these imports.
FDRA Chief Executive Matt Priest warned that the higher tariffs would result in job losses across the industry.
""Brands have already said tariffs will dent job growth and shoe stores are saying it's a job killer,"" Priest said in a statement. ""We hope the president listens to Americans across the country ... and stops this unnecessary trade war.""
The letter also rejected comments from U.S. officials who say China can simply devalue its currency to cover the added costs.
""This is simply not true when it comes to our industry, because import prices are almost always quoted and negotiated in U.S. dollars not RMB (Chinese yuan),"" it said. ""For RMB devaluation alone to offset the 15 percent tariff increase for some shoes, the currency would have to drop by more than 40 percent."""

The stock gained nearly 5% in midday trading.
Coty announced the breakup during its quarterly results and said it plans to sell its 60% stake in the company back to the founders. 
In July the company announced it would take a $3 billion writedown on brands it acquired from Procter & Gamble's (NYSE:PG) beauty business, which it has struggled to sell as consumer demand for drugstore cosmetics falls. 
Losses at the company widened to $2.8 billion, or $3.72 per share, while revenue fell 8% to $2.12 billion, compared to expectations of $2.11 billion. Adjusted earnings per share came in at $0.16, in line with forecasts compiled by Investing.com."

(Reuters) - Cosmetics maker  Coty Inc  (N:COTY) raised its annual revenue forecast on Wednesday, as it embarks on a multi-year turnaround plan that involves cost cuts and increased investment in advertising, sending shares up 5%.
The company said in July it would write down about $3 billion in value of brands acquired from Procter & Gamble Co (N:PG) in 2016, and laid out a restructuring plan to turn around the business hurt by falling sales in its consumer beauty unit.
The plan involves reducing organizational layers and reorganizing the operation into regional units with new business heads. Coty expects to incur restructuring costs of about $300 million during the year.
The consumer beauty unit has suffered in the past, mainly from the poor performance of brands it bought from P&G, including Covergirl and Max Factor, due to integration issues.
Consumers shifting to trendier, Instagram-friendly brands like NYX and Winky Lux has also been hurting the unit.
Coty said it was now pumping money into advertising, while cutting down on promotion and discounts, to boost sales of brands sold under the segment.
""We have been historically overpromoting... We have made the decision to be less dependent on promotion and more dependent upon advertising,"" Chief Executive Officer Pierre Laubies told analysts.
Laubies said revenue projections for the year reflect ""clearly improving trends"" in the segment, and stressed that the unit may not show a growth, but a reduction in decline.
The company expects net revenue, on a comparable basis, to be flat to slightly lower in fiscal 2020, with visible progress in the first quarter. It had earlier estimated a moderating decline in net revenue.
In the fourth quarter, revenue from the consumer beauty segment fell 15.2% to $902.4 million, as it also took a hit from its online Younique brand.
Coty on Wednesday said it ended its partnership with the brand, in which it bought a 60% stake in 2017.
""Management seems to have a handle on the business and is starting building credibility with investors,"" RBC Capital Markets' Nik Modi said.
Coty also forecast earnings to grow by mid-single digits in the current year. Wall Street estimated earnings of 68 cents, or a growth of 5.8%, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Net loss widened to $2.80 billion, in the reported quarter, from $181.3 million, a year earlier, mainly due to the writedown.
Excluding items, Coty earned 16 cents, meeting analysts' estimate. Net revenue slipped 8% to $2.12 billion, slightly above expectations."

1147,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 28, 2019 11:37AM ET</span>","Tiffany profit tops Street estimates, sales fall on tourist spending drop","By Melissa Fares and Uday Sampath Kumar
(Reuters) - Luxury jeweler Tiffany & Co (N:TIF) on Wednesday reported quarterly earnings that beat estimates on increased spending by local customers in mainland China and a cut-back on marketing costs, even as declines in tourist spending in the United States and political unrest in Hong Kong dragged on sales. 
The New York-based company also said it would stick to its full-year forecast of a low-single-digit percentage rise in sales.
A protracted U.S-China trade war, strong dollar and a stricter U.S. visa approval process have contributed to a near 3% drop in Chinese citizens arriving in the United States this year, pressuring American retailers that are reliant on the high-spending tourists. 
Tiffany's shares were up 4.3% at $86.14 in morning trading.
Chief Executive Alessandro Bogliolo told Reuters that while spending outside of China was down and currency headwinds and business disruptions in Hong Kong - Tiffany's fourth largest market - persisted, sales in mainland China were robust.
""There is little we can do on tourist slows around the world so our way to react to this is to continue to be more active locally, domestically in China where customers are,"" Bogliolo said.
Tiffany said expenses fell 5% in the quarter, but that it expects to spend more on marketing in the second half of the year to entice younger shoppers into its stores and continues to renovate its flagship shop in Manhattan. Last quarter, the retailer suspended much of its digital marketing as it revamped its websites.
The jeweler has worked to refresh its collections with more affordable items such as pendants and earrings to appeal to millennials who have been gravitating to lower-priced competitors such as Denmark's  Pandora  A/S (CO:PNDORA) and Signet Jewelers (N:SIG).
Bogliolo acknowledged the company did not launch as many new product assortments in the first half of the year compared with last year when Tiffany unveiled Paper Flowers, its floral jewelry collection made of more affordable platinum and diamonds, but said ""this will be reversed in the second part of the year.""
Tiffany reported ""strong growth"" in mainland China but ""softness"" in Hong Kong and ""mixed performance"" in other markets in the region. 
""We view the macroeconomic noise surrounding Hong Kong protests and lower tourist spending as temporal, and Tiffany is well-positioned to recoup lost profits elsewhere, including mainland China,"" said CFRA Research analyst Camilla Yanushevsky.
The company's quarterly same-store sales, excluding the effects of currency exchange rates, fell 3%. Analysts had expected a 1.3% decrease, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. 
Tiffany's net earnings fell to $136.3 million, or $1.12 per share, in its fiscal second quarter, ended July 31, from $144.7 million, or $1.17 per share, a year earlier.
Analysts had expected earnings of $1.04 per share. 
Net sales fell to $1.05 billion from $1.08 billion, missing Wall Street estimates of $1.06 billion.

Before Wednesday, Tiffany's shares had fallen nearly 12% this month on U.S. President Donald Trump's threats to ratchet up a trade war with Beijing.

1148,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 28, 2019 11:21AM ET</span>",India eases foreign investment rules for several sector to boost growth,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's federal cabinet on Wednesday approved further liberalizing of foreign direct investment (FDI) rules in four sectors, in an effort to get economic growth back on track.
The government approved foreign investment in digital media up to stakes of 26%, allowed 100% foreign investment for coal mining, associated infrastructure and sales of fuel.
Till now, foreign investment was only allowed in coal mines allotted for captive use, meaning for use by the companies themselves.
The new mining investment policy will to open up investment avenues for companies like PeaBody (N:BTU),  Glencore  (L:GLEN) and BHP Group Ltd (AX:BHP).
New Delhi also allowed 100% foreign direct investment in contract manufacturing and eased sourcing norms for single-brand retailers.
The government said single-brand retail firms would be permitted to open online stores before setting up bricks-and-mortar stores, making it easier for firms like Apple Inc (O:AAPL), which do not operate retail stores in the country, to start selling their products online.
Lack of investment was partly responsible for the country's relatively sluggish economic growth of 5.8% in the January-March quarter. Analysts predict a slower growth rate for April-June, data on which is expected to be released on Friday.
Last week, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman proposed a series of measures to help the economy and financial markets, and earlier this week the central bank said it would transfer nearly $21 billion in dividends, 64% more than expected, which could be used to further stimulate the economy.
""Liberalizing foreign direct investment will help in increasing economic growth"" Piyush Goyal, trade and railways minister, told reporters in New Delhi.
Presenting the annual budget for 2019/20 in July, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had said the government would hold discussions with stakeholders to relax FDI rules in the aviation, media, animation and insurance sectors, and ease rules for single-brand retailers.
""The FDI relaxations fulfils long standing reforms sought by many companies that wanted to set up shop in India. Particularly, easing local sourcing norms and contract manufacturing will help us compete with manufacturing hubs in South and south east Asia,"" said Vaibhav Kakkar, partner at a law firm L&L Partners."
1149,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 28, 2019 10:49AM ET</span>",United Airlines moving its Boeing 737 MAX jets to short-term storage in Arizona,"By Tracy Rucinski 
CHICAGO (Reuters) - United Airlines (O:UAL) is starting to move its 14 Boeing 737 MAX jets to short-term storage in Phoenix, Arizona, which has better weather for stored aircraft and where it will be easier to prepare them for commercial flight again, the carrier said on Wednesday.
Boeing Co's (N:BA) 737 MAX fleet was grounded worldwide in March after two fatal crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia that killed a total of 346 people within five months.
The aircraft maker is working on a fix for the software at the center of both crashes and is aiming to get the jet back in the air as soon as October, Boeing Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg told Reuters on Tuesday.
Once the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration approves the new software and pilot training, airlines will have to upload the software changes and run a series of maintenance checks on the jets before flying them again with passengers.
Having all of its MAX planes in one place at Phoenix Goodyear Airport will be more efficient for that process, United said.
The airline has received a ferry permit from the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration for each of the 14 flights to Phoenix from their current locations in Houston, where it cited hurricane threats, and Los Angeles. The permits allow an airline to ferry an aircraft from one place to another.
Airlines that own the MAX have been forced to cancel thousands of flights since the planes were grounded, hitting profits during the busy summer travel season.
Chicago-based United has removed its MAX jets from its flight schedule until Nov. 3, and did not make any changes to that timeline on Wednesday.

Southwest Airlines (N:LUV), the world's largest MAX operator, is scheduling without its 34 jets until early January. Those jets are parked at a facility in Victorville, California, at the southwestern edge of the Mojave Desert.

(Reuters) -  Citigroup  Inc. (N:C) raised its minimum wage to $15 per hour earlier this year following pressure from politicians and similar moves by other big banks.
Data released by U.S. Representative Maxine Waters, chair of the House Financial Services Committee, shows that Citi raised its minimum wage in June following a request by the congresswoman for the third largest bank by assets to commit to increasing the minimum wage to $20 per hour.
Lawmakers grilled Chief Executive Officer Michael Corbat in April over the disparity between executive pay and compensation for the median worker at Citi. Of the top banks, Citi had the largest pay gap with the Corbat earning 486 times the amount of the median worker.
In February, Citi said Corbat would get a 4.35 percent raise, bringing his total compensation for 2018 to $24 million: a base salary of $1.5 million plus cash bonuses of about $6.75 million, equity awards of nearly $7.88 million, and a long-term performance based pay worth $7.88 million.
A number of banks raised their minimum wage after receiving large tax cuts following the enactment of the President Donald Trump's corporate tax cuts. JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) raised its minimum wage to $15 and $18 per hour depending on the local cost of living,  Wells Fargo  & Co (N:WFC) raised its minimum wage to $15 per hour and Bank of America Corp (N:BAC) has pledged to raise its minimum wage to $20 by 2021."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The S&P 500 stock index will see limited gains in the remaining months of 2019 as anxiety over slowing global growth and the U.S.-China trade war weigh against expectations of monetary policy easing, according to a Reuters poll of strategists.
The U.S. benchmark index (SPX) will likely finish 2019 at 2,925, nearly 2% higher than Tuesday's close, based on the median forecast of 47 strategists polled by Reuters in the last two weeks. This would represent an almost 17% jump from the end of 2018.
The targets were little changed from a Reuters poll in May.
Most respondents still viewed global monetary policy easing as a net positive for equities, but a majority said the risk to their market expectations was skewed to the downside.
""You have slow global growth. You've got a yield curve inversion. You've got a lot of uncertainty around trade tariff policy and a Federal Reserve that, by all accounts, is probably behind the curve right now, cutting too slow, based on financial conditions,"" said Darrell Cronk, chief investment officer for  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Wealth and Investment Management in New York.
Cronk expects the current bull market to continue into 2021 as U.S. consumer spending remains strong and corporate earnings grow, albeit at a much slower pace than in 2018.
But the U.S-China trade war looms large as a key risk to bullish targets for the market. Strategists are concerned that higher prices resulting from tariffs could result in slower global trade and a weakening international economy.
""The risk to our rosy view has clearly risen,"" said Hank Smith, chairperson of the investment selection committee at Haverford Trust co in Randor, Pennsylvania, adding, ""Trump may think China-bashing is a winning issue"" for the 2020 U.S. presidential election or that China may not be willing to negotiate due to the possibility that Trump may not get re-elected.
While the S&P's close on Tuesday showed a year-to-date gain of 14.45% and was roughly 5% below its record close on July 26, daily volatility since then has often been attributed to dramatic changes in the tone of U.S. President Donald Trump's comments about the trade war.
""Very much depends on how long disruptive trade policies continue. If they go on much longer, the effects will be longer term and it might be too late to reverse them due to lost trust with trade partners,"" said Bryant Evans, investment advisor at Cozad Asset Management in Champaign, Illinois.
The poll showed the Dow finishing 2019 at 26,007, according to the median forecast of 26 strategists. That's up just 1% from Tuesday's close and an advance of 11.5% from the end of 2018."

Blackstone is offering $19.50 for all outstanding Class A shares, a 36% premium to Tuesday’s close, Tallgrass said in a statement. The take-private proposal is valued at about $3 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Blackstone’s offer is the latest example of financial players trying to privatize the slumping energy companies they control.   Brookfield Business Partners LP   (NYSE:BBU) in May made a take-private offer for   Teekay Offshore Partners LP   (NYSE:TOO), and ArcLight Capital Partners LLC in March agreed to acquire the portion of   American Midstream Partners LP   (NYSE:AMID) it didn’t already own. The offers for these firms, structured as master limited partnerships, have come after the bidders took control of the general partner.
It’s a good sign for other U.S. pipeline companies, said Hinds Howard, a portfolio manager at CBRE Clarion Securities LLC. “Valuations look a bit out of whack for some of these names the market has given up on.”
Earlier this year, Blackstone and its affiliates entered into agreements to acquire Tallgrass’s general partner and a 44% economic interest in the company for $3.3 billion. Tallgrass shares have fallen 40% since that announcement was made Jan. 31. Blackstone declined to comment.
While an eventual take-out was generally expected, the timing of the deal likely surprised investors who expected Blackstone to wait until Tallgrass got new or returning shippers to sign up for space on two of its key pipelines, Tudor Pickering Holt & Co. analysts said in a note to clients.
The shares rose 36% to $19.52 at 9:34 a.m. in New York. Tallgrass’s 5.5% bonds due January 2028 were among top high-yield decliners Wednesday, sinking 2.875 cents on the dollar to 95 cents, according to Trace data. The debt yields 6.3%.
Tallgrass operates Pony Express -- which carries oil from the Niobrara shale basin in Wyoming and Colorado to the U.S. oil hub in Cushing, Oklahoma -- and the Rockies Express gas pipeline that stretches from Colorado to Ohio. It’s also announced plans to build Seahorse oil pipeline, which would bring 800,000 barrels a day from Oklahoma to the Louisiana Gulf Coast.
Tallgrass has been weighed down as competition from rival pipelines has stoked concerns that the company might have to cut its rates on Pony Express or possibly even scrap plans for Seahorse."

1157,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 28, 2019 09:35AM ET</span>",China's Fosun set to save Thomas Cook as key terms agreed,"By Paul Sandle and Alistair Smout
LONDON (Reuters) - British travel operator Thomas Cook Group (L:TCG) said on Wednesday it had agreed the main terms of a rescue package that will see China's Fosun Tourism (HK:1992) take over its tour operations and creditor banks and bondholders acquire its airline.
The world's oldest travel company and pioneer of the package tour, has struggled with intense competition in popular destinations, high debt levels and an unusually hot summer in 2018 which reduced its last-minute bookings.
The debt burden meant the company had to sell 3 million holidays a year just to pay the interest, it said last month. 
Thomas Cook also said in July that it was working to secure new investment from shareholder Fosun Tourism which would see the Chinese group take control of the business, along with Thomas Cook's lenders whose debt would be converted into equity. 
The terms announced on Wednesday will see Fosun - whose Chinese parent owns all-inclusive holiday firm Club Med - contribute 450 million pounds ($552 million) of new money in return for at least 75% of the tour operator business and 25% of the group's airline.
Thomas Cook's lending banks and bondholders will stump up a further 450 million pounds and convert their existing debt to equity, giving them in total about 75% of the airline and up to 25% in the tour operator business, the group said.
The recapitalization plan, which is subject to a legally binding agreement between the parties, will result in a significant dilution in existing Thomas Cook shareholders' interests, the company said, but it had decided it was the best way to secure the future of the group for all its stakeholders. 
Shares in Thomas Cook, which were trading at 150 pence in May 2018, were down 12% at just above 6 pence on Wednesday.
Russ Mould, investment director at broker AJ Bell, said shareholders in the troubled travel company may have to accept that their investment could be worthless.
""Investors are simply trying to cash out and crystallize any value left in their investment before the refinancing, for fear there could be nothing left if they wait,"" he said.
Thomas Cook, founded by its namesake in 1841, said it intended to maintain the company's listing on the London Stock Exchange if possible.
British trade union TSSA welcomed the plan. ""This appears to be good news for our members as Thomas Cook's presence on our high streets looks to have been saved,"" said leader Manuel Cortes.
Earlier this year, Thomas Cook said it was exploring a sale of its airline business, which consists of German carrier Condor and UK, Spanish and Scandinavian operations, but a further profit warning in May left management seeking a more radical solution to save the business.
Analyst Mark Irvine-Fortescue at Stifel said the airline was likely to be put up for sale again in due course, making for an uncertain relationship with the tour operator.
Fosun Tourism's parent Fosun International (HK:0656) was co-founded by billionaire Guo Guangchang and is one of China's biggest conglomerates. It has spent billions of dollars over the past decade on healthcare, tourism and fashion companies in the United States and Europe.
As well as Club Med, Fosun International also owns English Premier League soccer team Wolverhampton Wanderers FC.

Fosun said earlier this year it would adopt an asset-light strategy and run Club Med resorts it plans to launch in China and other countries under management contracts.

Sales of nonalcoholic beverages have been gaining by double-digit percentages, reaching more than 10% of the Danish brewer’s revenue in the land of vodka over the past two years, Lars Lehmann, executive vice president for eastern Europe, said in an interview. Russia, Carlsberg’s second-biggest market, has been raising beer taxes gradually since 2009, which has cut sharply into sales.
Carlsberg recently began Russian production of Barley Bros, a brewed soft drink sold in flavors including lemon with mint and apple with green tea. The company’s Baltika 0 Grapefruit alcohol-free beer, a new variety of its Baltika 0 line, is also picking up sales there, according to Lehmann.
The offering is “for refreshment,” Lehmann said, “not just a beer for those who can’t drink alcohol.”

HONG KONG/ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Tab Food Investments (TFI), the biggest worldwide franchisee of Burger King, has asked  Citigroup  to help to sell a minority stake in the business in China and Turkey, a deal which could fetch at least $200 million, two sources familiar with the matter said.
Istanbul-based TFI, founded by the Kurdoglu family, operates nearly 1,700 Burger King outlets in Turkey and China. TFI began investing in China in 2012 and now has a network of more than 1,000 Burger King restaurants in more than 150 Chinese cities, according to its website.
The company, also a franchisee of fast-food chicken chain Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen and pizza brand Sbarro, last year postponed https://reut.rs/2UaQJGU plans for a $220-million initial public offering in New York amid market jitters.
TFI wants the value of the potential stake sale to imply an enterprise value of about $1 billion, the sources said.
First-round indicative bids will be due by the end of next week, one source, who declined to be named as the information was not public, said.
TFI is seeking new partners to help speed up growth in China through new restaurant openings, food-delivery services and digital transformation, the source said.
The source also said TFI was considering listing its businesses in China and Turkey, or only the China franchise, in Hong Kong as early as next year.
TFI made about $70 million in earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization last year. Its 2019 EBITDA is expected to be about $90 million, one of the sources said.
TFI said its China and Turkey operations continue to attract the attention of potential investors.
""In the current period, there is an increasing investor interest in our company,"" Burcu Bati, TFI's chief financial officer, told Reuters in an emailed statement. ""TFI is always open to evaluate strategic options that would be in the best interest of the company.""
Citigroup (N:C) declined to comment.
Burger King's major rivals include KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell brands in China, for which exclusive licenses are held by Yum China (N:YUMC), a Yum Brands (N:YUM) spin-off.
McDonald's Corp (N:MCD) sold the bulk of its China business https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mcdonalds-china-citic-idUSKBN14T0FH to state-backed conglomerate CITIC Ltd (HK:0267) and private equity giant  Carlyle Group  (NASDAQ:CG) in 2017.
TFI's China business is also part-owned by private equity firm Cartesian Capital Group and Restaurant Brands International (TO:QSR), the owner of Burger King itself.
They own 50%, 22.5% and 27.5% of the China business respectively, according to the IPO prospectus TFI filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission last year."

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Investor optimism is on the rebound in Brazil after the government made progress on a pension reform bill, shifted its focus to tax reform and has cut interest rates to record lows, even as Mexico's outlook deteriorates.
The latest Reuters poll on Brazil's equity market, Latin America's largest, showed its Bovespa index (BVSP) rising an additional 18.22% from current levels by the end of the year to a record 115,000 points, according to the median estimates of 12 strategists and traders.
The estimate is slightly higher than the last Reuters poll in May, but optimism remains below where it was in February, when the government of Jair Bolsonaro had just come into office and investors then expected the Bovespa to rise to 120,000 points.
For Mexico, by contrast, strategists now estimate the S&P/BVM IPC index (MXX) will close at a median of 45,500 points, up about 12% from where it stands now, but still over 5,000 points short of its July 2017 high. That estimate marks the third downward revision in a row.
It is then expected to gain another 2% by end-2020.
In Brazil, strategists expect the Bovespa to rise an extra 13% in 2020, reaching 130,000 points. The Bovespa has doubled since the beginning of 2016, and will have more than tripled in five years if those estimates prove accurate.
Strategists have raised their expectations on Brazil despite macroeconomic signs of a global slowdown and escalating tensions between the United States and China, which have hit the Brazilian real more than almost any other emerging market currency.
The Bovespa has also been affected, falling 10% since mid-July when it reached a record high, and is this week down to 96,000 points. But the pullback could also be an opportunity.
""When it hits 95,000, or 93,000 points, that is the time to buy in,"" said Jose Francisco de Lima Gonçalves, chief economist at Banco Fator.
Strategists broadly agree that in the case of Brazil the market has already priced in a sweeping pension reform bill that received preliminary congressional approval in July.
""Yes, the market has turned the page,"" said Karel Luketic, chief strategist at XP Investmentos, suggesting that final approval would not do much for investors.
Brazil's benchmark interest rate has also fallen to a record low and may not have yet reached its floor, which analysts hope will push Brazilians into equities, despite foreign investors cutting their exposure this year.
""The local investor is more than compensating the exit of foreign investors,"" said André Carvalho, head of macro, strategy and fixed-income research at Bradesco BBI. ""The marginal buyer is Brazilian.""
The optimism about Brazil is almost nonexistent in the case of Mexico, as President Andrés López Obrador's government has struggled to drive growth.
""In Mexico, the economic slowdown has been worse than anticipated,"" said Luis Alfonso Alvarado, an analyst at Banco Base. ""This coincides with continuing uncertainty over what measures will be taken with Petroleos Mexicanos and the effect those could have on public finances."""
1162,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 28, 2019 08:49AM ET</span>",Don’t Discount Costco’s Chances in China,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- China has been a graveyard for many foreign retailers, which frequently arrived with grand hopes only to pull back after years of debilitating struggle.  Carrefour  (PA:CARR) SA sold 80% of its operations in June after more than two decades in the country,  Tesco  (LON:TSCO) Plc folded its business into a joint venture in 2013, and Metro AG is seeking a buyer for its Chinese unit. Costco Wholesale Corp (NASDAQ:COST). has more reason than most to believe it can buck the trend.
It’s an inauspicious time to enter the world’s second-largest economy. Growth has slowed, and the trade war has made the environment less hospitable for overseas companies. China’s plan to set up a corporate social credit system will raise compliance costs and could put some firms out of business, the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China said Wednesday. At the same time, online shopping is increasingly taking market share from bricks-and-mortar retailers. None of that stopped Costco’s first Chinese outlet, in Shanghai, from being mobbed on its opening Tuesday.
It’s probably not a flash in the pan, opening-day discounts notwithstanding. China’s consumer markets are fickle and retail is viciously competitive, with razor-thin margins. Still, Costco looks to have picked its niche carefully. The Shanghai outlet is in a suburban district, aiming to cater to car-driving shoppers willing to load up with bulk items such as 30-pack boxes of cookies or 200-fluid-ounce (6-liter) bottles of detergent. Selling in quantity helps enable the discounts that underpin Costco’s appeal.
Such a model wouldn’t work in the more built-up central areas of Shanghai, where most people live in cramped apartments and take public transport. That needn’t matter to Costco, though, as long as the U.S. retailer can find enough suitable suburban markets. Costco’s outlet in Shanghai’s Minhang district has parking space for 1,200 cars, more than any other of its locations.
Membership is a key element of Costco’s pitch to consumers. Being part of a fee-paying club adds an aura of exclusivity that may play well with Chinese shoppers, particularly when the Shanghai store offers high-end products such as Maine lobsters, bluefin tuna and Birkin bags. Costco was charging an introductory membership fee of 199 yuan ($28) at Tuesday’s opening, which will rise to 299 yuan.
Costco has already shown that it can export its warehouse model, building successful operations in Japan, Taiwan and South Korea. Revenue from international operations more than tripled in the past 10 years.
Sam’s Club, a warehouse membership chain owned by Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc. that’s been in China for more than 20 years, gives cause for optimism on Costco’s entry. Sam’s Club has pushed upmarket by adding services such private dental clinics (for a higher membership fee) and aims to increase outlets in the country to 40 in 2020, from 23 at the start of this year, company executives told the China Daily in January. Chinese consumers have become increasingly willing to pay for better services in the past one to two years, Chen Zhiyu, senior vice president of Sam's Club China, was cited as saying.
Costco positions itself as a higher-end shopping destination than Sam’s Club, and has built a reputation for quality fresh food. That may be the company’s best bulwark against the encroachment of internet operators. Venture capital money has been pouring into online grocers, as my colleague Shuli Ren observed last month. Even so, most shoppers in China still like to touch or at least see their vegetables with their own eyes. Sam's Club drove a 4.7% surge in Walmart’s China sales in its most recent quarter, thanks largely to fresh-food sales.
Costco has had a five-year online partnership with  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd. in China to market its flagship private label Kirkland. That’s helped to build the company’s name in China ahead of its entry to physical retail. A strategy that integrates the two may be critical to flourish in China’s demanding retail landscape. “In many parts of China, same-day delivery really means same-hour delivery,” as Walmart observed in its 2019 annual report. The Sam’s Club owner has a partnership with Chinese e-commerce giant JD.com Inc.
Shares of Costco rose 5% on Tuesday, the most since March. That may overstate the potential from a Chinese expansion that’s likely to be modest and incremental, at least at first. But if Costco can thrive in China’s current conditions, it should be there to stay."

Jalil Rasheed, currently Invesco's CEO of South Asian operations, will join PNB and take over from Abdul Rahman Ahmad whose contract ends on Sep. 30, PNB said in a statement.
It said the appointment was ""in line with the government's wish to make optimal use of Malaysian global talents and consistent with PNB's strategic initiative to diversify its assets globally.""
Abdul Rahman will become non-executive chairman at  Sime Darby Bhd  (KL:SIME), in which PNB owns a 52% stake.
Government-linked funds and firms have seen a number of leadership shake-ups since the unprecedented victory of Mahathir's opposition coalition in May 2018 elections, as he had criticized the management of these firms and promised structural reforms.
In June last year, former central bank governor Zeti Akhtar Aziz was named group chairman at PNB and a month later, sovereign wealth fund Khazanah Nasional's managing director and entire board resigned en masse due to political pressure.
PNB currently has over 300 billion ringgit ($72 billion) in assets under management. The fund was set up in 1978 by the government to enhance wealth among ethnic Malays via participation in the equity market."

MONTREAL (Reuters) - A global shortage of pilots and mechanics is preventing some Canadian aviation service companies from meeting the needs of airlines and other customers scrambling to secure replacements for grounded Boeing (N:BA) 737 MAX jets. 
North American airlines have canceled thousands of flights since the March grounding of the 737 MAX following two fatal crashes involving the model. In an already busy industry, this has stoked demand for replacement aircraft, and several Canadian companies are eager to oblige.
But the industry-wide labor shortage has complicated matters, companies said.
""I have the planes but I don't have enough pilots to do all the flights,"" said Marco Prud'Homme, vice-president of Montreal-area Nolinor Aviation.
The charter company has had to refuse some of the surging number of client requests in the wake of the MAX grounding because of the pilot shortage. 
Globally, many large lessors and aftermarket service providers who do plane maintenance have generally seen muted impact from the grounding because they are already fully booked, analysts and executives say.
The aviation industry has long been wrestling with a shortage of pilots and mechanics. A 2017 report by training company  CAE  (TO:CAE) forecasts the need for an extra 255,000 pilots by 2027 to sustain passenger traffic which is expected to double in the next 20 years.
Stephen Lim, president of ST Engineering Aerospace America, said by email that any longer-term upward pressure on MRO (maintenance, repair and overhaul) pricing could ""come from increasing labor costs, primarily due to an industry-wide shortage of experienced mechanics.""
In Canada, labor concerns have emerged in the province of Quebec, home to most of Canada's aviation industry. 
When the provincial government announced plans to scale back accepted immigrants by 20% this year, as part of a broader system overhaul, employers' groups warned it could make it harder to fill vacancies in multiple sectors.
TIGHT LABOR MARKET
According to an August report from the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, Quebec had a job vacancy rate of 3.2%, one of the highest in the country alongside British Columbia. Canada's overall unemployment rate edged up to 5.7% in July after slipping to 5.4% in May -- its lowest recorded rate since comparable data became available in 1976.
Earl Diamond, chief executive of Avianor, which specializes in aircraft maintenance and cabin integration, said meeting rising demand from clients hinges on staffing and space, which are at a premium in the company's bustling Montreal-area facility.
A recent spate of airline bankruptcies from India to Iceland, combined with the MAX grounding, have thrust privately held Avianor into the center of the scramble for replacement planes. 
The company is removing the purple seat covers and carpets from an A320 formerly operated by now defunct WOW Air of Iceland, and reconfiguring the cabin for Air Canada's (TO:AC) leisure carrier Rouge.
""For them it's getting the planes into their fleets as soon as possible,"" Diamond told Reuters during a recent visit to the company's facility. 
To meet higher-than-usual demand from lessors and airlines, Avianor had to call back some of its workers from vacation this summer, Diamond said. 
Avianor is trying to add another 70 workers, and had already taken on temporary labor from Mexico to supplement its existing staff of 400 employees. 
In Quebec, aviation companies are taking steps to find workers, with Nolinor holding a Sept. 7 career day to attract mechanics. The company has also offered to fund the C$100,000 retraining cost for each of two employees chosen to become pilots, Prud'Homme said. 

""It's one of the biggest problems we have in the industry.""

LONDON (Reuters) - World stocks slipped on Wednesday as a deepening inversion of the U.S. bond yield curve a day earlier reignited worries over the possibility of recession, sending investors towards perceived safe-haven assets from the Japanese yen to gold.
The U.S. yield curve inverted on Tuesday to levels not seen since 2007, stoking a sell-off on Wall Street. An inversion of the yield curve - where yields on shorter-dated debt are above those on longer-dated paper - has historically been a highly accurate predictor of a U.S. recession.
MSCI's world equity index (MIWD00000PUS), which tracks shares in 47 countries, fell 0.1%, dragged down by European shares. The broad Euro STOXX 600 (STOXX) fell 0.6%, with bourses in Paris (FCHI) and Frankfurt (GDAXI) tumbling 0.6% and 0.7% respectively. 
However, UK stocks bucked the trend (FTSE), turning positive to gain 0.3% as sterling dived 1% on Prime Minister Boris Johnson's move to restrict parliamentary time before Britain's planned departure from the European Union. 
Johnson will limit parliament's ability to derail his Brexit plans by unveiling his new legislative agenda on Oct. 14, a government source told Reuters, stoking fears of an economically disruptive no-deal departure from the EU.
The pound, already trading lower on the day, was last down 0.6% at $1.2210. 
Still, Wall Street futures gauges   suggested U.S. stocks would show more resilience, forecasting gains of around 0.2%. 
""It's become very difficult for investors to garner an idea of where we go to next,"" said Michael Hewson, chief market strategist at CMC Markets. ""The weakness in bond yields and the strength in havens speaks to an investor that is becoming increasingly risk-averse."" 
The 10-year Treasury yield (US10YT=RR) had fallen on Tuesday to around 6 basis points below the two-year yield (US2YT=RR), with the 10-year yield close to three-year low touched on Monday. 
Longer-dated bond yields also fell. The U.S. 30-year Treasury yield (US30YT=RR) slumped to a record low of 1.906%, and was last down 6 basis points on the day. 
Some investors said market fears of a looming recession, would further support expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve would cut interest rates further - something they warned is not a foregone conclusion.
Federal funds futures  implied traders saw a 91% chance of a 25 basis point rate cut by the U.S. central bank next month, and a 100 basis point cut within 2020.
""The market is pricing another 100 basis points cut from the Fed by next year, but the Fed seems rather reticent to follow where the market is indicating it should go,"" said Peter Schaffrik, head of European rates strategy at RBC Capital Markets.

The renewed fears of a global economic slowdown bolstered demand for assets perceived as safe havens. 
Gold  turned positive after starting the day in the red, and was last flat at $1,542.91. Silver  gained 1.2%, putting it on course for its fourth straight day of gains. 
In currencies, the Japanese yen kept a grip on its recent gains. The yen, seen as a safe haven in part because of Japan's large trade surplus and a tendency for domestic investors to repatriate money in times of market turbulence, traded at 105.78 per dollar . It held its gains from the previous day, when it advanced 0.35% to a 7-month peak.
The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of currencies, gained 0.1% to 98.094 (DXY). Currencies that tend to perform well when investors buy into riskier assets, such as the Australian  and New Zealand  dollars, fell.

OSLO (Reuters) - Norway's $1 trillion sovereign wealth fund, the world's largest, should have more freedom to invest in unlisted equities, its manager said on Wednesday, a proposal that could help the fund better capture the growth of U.S. tech firms.
The world's largest sovereign wealth fund, which pools Norway's revenues from oil and gas production in stocks, bonds and real estate abroad, is currently only allowed to invest in unlisted equities if a listing is imminent.
The fund's management has complained in the past about being unable to invest in companies early on in their growth, particularly U.S. tech firms, as companies have tended to seek a listing late on in their growth process.
""The (central) Bank is of the opinion that the wording of the current regulation that the board must have expressed 'an intention' to seek a listing should be amended,"" the central bank said in a letter to the finance ministry published on its website on Wednesday.
""To date, we have interpreted this mandate regulation as requiring a concrete board resolution to apply for listing in the near future.
""Our experience is that such resolutions are passed relatively late in the process, and that a number of transactions that might have been relevant to the fund have not therefore been pursued,"" it said.
The letter suggested an alternative could be to allow the fund to be invested in unlisted shares in large companies that are not yet listed, and that a limit of 1 percent of the equity portfolio could be dedicated to them.
This would have corresponded to 63.5 billion crowns ($7.1 billion) at the end of the second quarter, according to a Reuters calculation.
The fund is invested in close to 9,200 companies worldwide, holding on average 1.4% of all the world's listed shares.
It also held some $280 billion in fixed income globally at the end of the second quarter while in real estate, it is a co-owner of London's Regent Street and of properties on the Champs-Elysees in Paris, among others.
Investing in unlisted equities has been a vexed issue for the fund. In 2014 it joined U.S. investors BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) and Waddell & Reed to buy a $1.6 billion stake in motor racing's Formula One as an IPO was planned.
After the investment was made, Formula One canceled plans for the IPO, putting the fund in contravention of its own mandate. The fund came under political and media criticism for the investment and the fund's CEO acknowledged mistakes had been made."

(Reuters) - Russia's stock market is likely to struggle to climb higher by the end of this year, along with its global peers, but a Reuters poll of market experts foresees it gaining again in 2020.
Risks of more Western sanctions against Moscow, particularly on its sovereign debt, have partly materialized without causing a sell-off in the stock market. Now, global economic risks are expected to play a more important role for Russian stocks.
After posting solid gains in the first seven months of 2019, Russian stock indexes slipped in August and are likely to finish this year near current levels, before rising again by the end of 2020, a consensus forecast of around 12 analysts showed.
The rouble-based MOEX index (IMOEX) is forecast to decline more than 2% by the end of this year from 2659.35 on Aug. 27. Forecasts in the poll ranged from 2,400 to 2,900.
""The probability of a significant correction in equity markets this year looks low,"" said Konstantin Bushuev, head of research at Otkritie Brokerage.
The MOEX is seen staying around the year-end level in mid-2020 and then rising to 2,800 by the end of next year, according to the poll, which was conducted in the second half of August.
""Monetary easing is the main supportive factor for equities at the moment besides fiscal stimulus,"" said Iskander Lutsko, chief investment strategist at ITI Capital.
The U.S. Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank are expected to cut interest rates amid threats of an economic slowdown in the United States and Germany.
Risks are skewed more to the downside, as the S&P 500 index (SPX) may fall to 2,400 to 2,500 next year amid stagnation in the United States, said Evgeny Loktyukhov, chief analyst at Promsvyazbank. The S&P 500 index was last at 2876.47.
""We consider our look at the global economy and markets as a conservative one,"" Loktyukhov said.
The Russian central bank, contemplating sluggish economic growth and slowing inflation, is also seen lowering the cost of lending by the end of 2019.
Trade wars, particularly the one between the United States and China, are set to remain the key downside risk for markets and could overshadow easier monetary policy.
""If the Fed doesn't deliver enough, (the) trade war becomes uglier and the recession fears realize, we could see a longer period of 'risk-off' across the globe,"" said Vladimir Miklashevsky, senior economist and trading desk strategist at Danske Bank.
The dollar-based RTS index (IRTS) is forecast to trade at 1,268 points by the end of this year, around 1258.6 on Aug. 27. Forecasts in the poll ranged from 1,110 to 1,450.

""Over the long term we could maybe have a few companies less, rather than more, Chief Executive Antti Makinen told Reuters, adding he felt Solidium's stock portfolio was ""rather big"" in comparison with its Nordic peers.
""With the organization and the capital we have, it makes more sense to concentrate than to diversify our holdings.""
""If we diversified, we would move toward a passive equity fund type of investing,"" he said.
Solidium is a major shareholder in 13 listed Finnish companies, including  Stora Enso  (HE:STERV), Outokumpu (HE:OUT1V) and  Metso  (HE:METSO) and has a 0.1% stake in Nordea Bank (HE:NDAFI).
Makinen declined to comment on which holdings Solidium would consider selling off and said the changes could take time.

Solidium reported on Wednesday a return on its equity holdings of -3.0% in its financial year 2018-2019, which ended at the end of June, burdened in particular by steel maker Outokumpu and mining technology company Outotec (HE:OTE1V).
In recent years Outokumpu has struggled to make its Americas business unit profitable, while also being hit by stainless steel overcapacity in Europe, caused by the U.S-China trade row and tariffs.
But Makinen said Solidium, Outokumpu's largest shareholder with a 21.69% stake, intended to remain a patient owner, saying once overcapacity is reduced, the company had good potential."

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hundreds of protesters took to the streets of Hong Kong on Wednesday to denounce Cathay Pacific Airways (HK:0293) for dismissing crew taking part in or supporting anti-government rallies that have swept the Chinese-ruled city for weeks.
The Hong Kong Confederation of Trade Unions (HKCTU) switched the protest venue, originally planned to be outside the airline's airport headquarters, Cathay City, to the central financial district after police refused permission.
The airport was forced to close two weeks ago after protesters thronged the arrivals hall for days, grounding about 1,000 flights and occasionally clashing with police.
Cathay was targeted for its sacking of 20 pilots and cabin crew and what staff have described as ""white terror"", a phrase used in Hong Kong and elsewhere to describe anonymous acts that create a climate of fear.
""Revoke termination, stop terrorizing CX staff,"" proclaimed a black banner in English at the protest site where at least 2,000 gathered. ""Uphold our freedom of speech.""
CX is airline code for Cathay.
The airline has been caught in the crosswinds between authorities in Beijing and protesters who have staged sometimes violent demonstrations since June that have grown into the biggest challenge for authorities in the former British colony since it returned to Chinese rule in 1997.
China has denounced the protests and accused the United States and Britain of interfering in its affairs in Hong Kong. It has sent a clear warning that forceful intervention is possible.
Rebecca Sy, former head of a flight attendants' association, said she was fired without explanation after managers saw her Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) account.
""We never faced any disciplinary action from the company before. How come now they just terminate me without any valid reason? By simply showing me those printouts of my own private Facebook account?""
'NO GROUND FOR COMPROMISE'
China's aviation regulator demanded Cathay suspend staff from flying over its airspace if they were involved in, or supported, the demonstrations. At least 20 pilots and cabin crew have since been fired, the HKCTU said.
“Earlier this month, the Civil Aviation Administration of China issued a directive with regards to new safety and security measures with which we are required to fully comply,"" Cathay's director for corporate affairs, James Tong, said in a statement.
""We fully support the upholding of the Basic Law and all the rights and freedoms afforded by it. At the same time, we are also required to adhere to all of our regulatory duties, including those prescribed by the authorities in mainland China. The airline must do this; there is no ground for compromise.”
The Basic Law is the mini-constitution under which Hong Kong is ruled.
The protests in the Asian financial hub have posed the biggest challenge for Communist Party rulers in Beijing since President Xi Jinping took power in 2012.
Unrest escalated in mid-June over a now-suspended extradition bill that would have allowed people to be sent to mainland China for trial in Communist Party-controlled courts.
It has since evolved into calls for greater democracy under the ""one country, two systems"" formula under which Hong Kong has been administered since 1997, guaranteeing freedoms that include an independent judiciary.
A mannequin dressed as a Cathay flight attendant held a sign saying ""all five demands must be fulfilled"", referring to the broader protest calls to withdraw the extradition bill, set up an independent inquiry into complaints of police brutality, stop describing the protests as riots, waive charges against those arrested and resume political reform.
Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam has not ruled out the possibility her administration could invoke emergency powers.
More demonstrations are planned across Hong Kong in coming weeks, including a general strike on Monday and a protest against what demonstrators say is sexual violence by police.
It has been dubbed the ""#MeToo"" rally and participants were being encouraged to write ""#ProtestToo"" on their arms with red lipstick.
Police said they respected the privacy and rights of people under detention and were aware of online ""rumors"" that a person had been sexually harassed, which they said were false.
Hong Kong is on the verge of its first recession in a decade, weighed down by the protests and a prolonged U.S.-China trade war."
1171,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 28, 2019 07:10AM ET</span>",Investors Slam on Brakes in Emerging Markets as Risks Escalate,"(Bloomberg) -- Emerging market investors are piling back into safer asset classes as mounting trade tensions spell the end of this year’s clamor for yield.
Fears of global slowdown -- the fallout of Donald Trump’s trade war -- and the collapse of the Argentine market have dealt a blow to junk and local-currency bonds this month, the asset classes of choice for money managers looking to bolster their returns.
After outperforming for most of the year, high-yield dollar debt in emerging markets is poised to lose almost 4% this month, according to Bloomberg  Barclays  (LON:BARC) indexes. By contrast, lower-yielding investment-grade bonds in those same markets are on track for their longest stretch of monthly gains on record.
“Credit quality will matter, and I strongly prefer investment grade over high yield in emerging-market debt,” said Sergey Dergachev, senior portfolio manager at Union Investment in Frankfurt, who favors Indonesia, India, Egypt and Croatia. “I definitely see more volatility to come.”
Below are three charts that capture this pivot in the market, where the prospect of monetary easing to soften the blow of the trade dispute is supercharging demand for duration, driving investors into longer-dated debt sold by higher-quality issuers.
Safety Outperforms
The spread on monthly returns for the Bloomberg Barclays Emerging Markets Investment Grade Index and its high-yield counterpart has widened to more than 6 percentage points in August. That’s the biggest differential since October 2008, one month after the collapse of Lehman Brothers.
Even when adjusting for the blowout in bond spreads in Argentina this month, this measure holds at 5.9 percentage points, still the widest in more than a decade.
Leading the advance are bonds from Panama, Saudi Arabia and Qatar, according to Bloomberg Barclays indexes. Those issued by Argentina, Lebanon and Zambia, all given a CCC assessment by Fitch Ratings, were the hardest hit.
Duration Reigns
The out-performance is being compounded by the prospect for further monetary easing by the U.S. Federal Reserve. Since lower dollar funding costs give long-dated bonds a disproportionate boost, investment-grade issuers who are able to issue long-dated credit have gained the most.
Valuation Buffer
What’s more, by one measure at least, the bid for safety has room to run. The option-adjusted spread on the Bloomberg Barclays index of investment-grade debt in emerging markets -- a measure of yield above U.S. Treasuries -- is still trading within a range that has held over the past year and well above lows seen in early 2018.
In developing nations, “the balance of risks are skewed to the downside in the near-term,” said Patrick Wacker, a fund manager for emerging-market fixed income at UOB Asset Management Ltd. in Singapore. He prefers countries with “strong balance sheets” or improving fundamentals such as Russia, Qatar and Abu Dhabi.

1176,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 28, 2019 05:30AM ET</span>",J&J liable for $572 million in Oklahoma opioid epidemic trial; shares rise,"By Heide Brandes and Nate Raymond
NORMAN, Okla./BOSTON (Reuters) - An Oklahoma judge on Monday ordered Johnson & Johnson (N:JNJ) to pay $572.1 million to the state for its part in fueling an opioid epidemic by deceptively marketing addictive painkillers, a sum that was substantially less than investors had expected, driving up J&J's shares.
The state's attorney general had filed the lawsuit, seeking $17 billion to address the impact of the drug crisis on Oklahoma. It had been considered a bellwether for other litigation nationwide over the opioid epidemic.
""The expectation was this was going to be a $1.5 billion to $2 billion fine,"" said Jared Holz, healthcare strategist for Jefferies & Co. ""$572 million is a much lower number than had been feared.""
J&J said it would appeal the decision.
Shares of J&J were up 2% in extended trading following the decision, after an initial gain of more than 5%. Other drugmakers that sell opioid painkillers and are defending against similar lawsuits also rose after-hours, including Teva Pharmaceutical (NYSE:TEVA) Industries Ltd (TA:TEVA) up 2.6%, and Endo International Plc (O:ENDP), up 1.4% higher.
Opioids were involved in almost 400,000 overdose deaths from 1999 to 2017, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Since 2000, some 6,000 Oklahomans have died from opioid overdoses, according to the state's lawyers.
Roughly 2,500 lawsuits have been brought by states, counties and municipalities nationally seeking to hold drugmakers responsible for opioid abuse nationwide. Oklahoma's case was the first to go to trial. Some drugmakers have chosen to settle cases.
In holding J&J liable after a seven-week, non-jury trial, Judge Thad Balkman of Cleveland County District Court in Norman, Oklahoma, said the state proved that J&J's misleading marketing and promotion of its Duragesic and Nucynta painkillers created a public nuisance.
""The opioid crisis is an imminent danger and menace to Oklahomans,"" Balkman said.
Oklahoma wanted J&J to help it address the epidemic for the next 30 years by funding addiction treatment and prevention programs.
Balkman said in his written ruling that the award covered only one year of addressing the crisis because Oklahoma did not demonstrate the time and costs needed beyond that.
Lance Lang, a 36-year-old recovering user of opioids turned activist in Oklahoma City, said it was “short sighted” for the judge to have only ordered funding for a year. “There’s going to be people struggling with this for years,” he said in an interview.
J&J said it will ask that the award be put on hold during an appeal process that could stretch into 2021. The company also said Oklahoma failed to show that its products and activities had created a public nuisance.
""You can't sue your way out of the opioid abuse crisis,"" Sabrina Strong, a lawyer for J&J, said at a news conference after the verdict. ""Everyone must come together to address this. But J&J did not cause the opioid crisis.""
""ACCOUNTABLE FOR DEATHS AND ADDICTIONS""
The case was brought by Oklahoma Attorney General Mike Hunter, who alleged that J&J's marketing practices helped fuel the opioid epidemic by flooding the market with painkillers.
""Johnson & Johnson will finally be held accountable for thousands of deaths and addictions caused by their actions,"" Hunter said.
The trial came after Oklahoma had resolved claims against OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma LP in March for $270 million and Teva in May for $85 million, leaving J&J as the lone defendant.
The verdict came as two Ohio counties prepare for a scheduled October trial before a federal judge in Cleveland. About 2,000 lawsuits out of some 2,500 filed nationwide are consolidated in the case in Cleveland.
Endo International Plc (O:ENDP) and Allergan Plc (N:AGN) last week agreed to pay $15 million to avoid going to trial in October in a case by two Ohio counties, subject to court approval.
Some plaintiffs' lawyers have compared the opioid cases to litigation by states against the tobacco industry that led to a $246 billion settlement in 1998.
Joe Rice, a lead plaintiff's attorney for municipalities in the federal litigation, said if the Oklahoma award were extrapolated to other states, it could mean an annual abatement cost of around $38 billion.
“It does indicate that if I’m in the pharmaceutical business, I’ve got to think long and hard about annual payments of my share of that,” he said.
The judge overseeing the federal litigation in Ohio has been pushing for a global settlement.
J&J, which is among multiple pharmaceutical companies that are defendants in the federal litigation, said it remains ""open to viable options"" to resolve the Ohio case, including through settlement.
During the Oklahoma trial, lawyers for the state argued that J&J carried out a years-long marketing campaign that minimized the painkillers' addiction risks and promoted their benefits.
The lawyers called J&J an opioid ""kingpin"" and argued that its marketing created a public nuisance as doctors over-prescribed the drugs, leading to a surge in overdose deaths.
J&J countered that its marketing claims had scientific support and its painkillers accounted for a tiny fraction of opioids prescribed in Oklahoma. The company said in a statement that since 2008, its painkillers accounted for less than 1% of the U.S. market, including generics.
Teva said the ruling supported its rationale for settling the case before trial, and said it was preparing to defend itself in the upcoming trial in Ohio.
Purdue, which is also among the defendants in the Ohio litigation, did not immediately respond to a request for comment."

A deep inversion in the U.S. Treasury yield curve once again rattled investors worried about economic growth in the face of a U.S.-China trade war that is now in its second year and is weighing on the global economy.
The euro zone's government bond yields edged toward record lows on Wednesday. The pan-European STOXX 600 index (STOXX) slipped 0.45% by 0800 GMT, with Germany's trade-sensitive DAX (GDAXI) weighing with a 0.52% drop.
The technology sector (SX8P) fell 1.2%, hit by a forecast cut from U.S. software company  Autodesk Inc  (O:ADSK). Software provider SAP SE (DE:SAP), chipmaker Infineon Technologies AG (DE:IFXGn) and payments company Wirecard AG (DE:WDIG) fell between 0.8% and 1.5%.

""Investors cannot rule out another spike in U.S.-China trade tensions coming out of the blue in the near-term, which ensures that markets will remain trepidatious for the time being.""
The trade dispute is putting an increasing strain on the global economy, forcing policy makers to respond with fiscal stimulus to bolster growth.

1179,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 28, 2019 05:26AM ET</span>",StockBeat: BP Positions Itself for Shale Patch Bargain Hunt,"By Geoffrey Smith
Investing.com --   BP   (LON:BP) is bolstering its position for a bargain hunt, and the market approves.
Under a deal announced late on Tuesday,  BP  (LON:BP) will sell its entire Alaskan business, including production assets on the North Slope and its stake in the Trans Alaska Pipeline System, to privately-held Hilcorp Alaska for $5.6 billion.
The deal is big enough to take  BP  (LON:BP) more than halfway to its target of raising $10 billion in asset sales by the end of next year and – assuming the deal clears the standard regulatory hurdles – will significantly strengthen the company’s balance sheet at a time when the outlook for the sector is more than usually clouded by the U.S.-China trade war and the risk of a disruptive Brexit. The company’s share price has fallen by nearly 15% since April, as those twin threats to growth have become ever more material.
All other things being equal, the receipts from the sale would bolster BP's cash pile by around a quarter. That should reduce the volatility of its share price, offering some protection against any further worsening of sentiment in the market at large.
It also leaves  BP  (LON:BP) in an enviable position for future M&A activity, which the company has suggested is likely on more than one occasion. In Tuesday’s statement, CEO Bob Dudley was at pains to stress: “We remain very bullish on the U.S. energy sector. In just the last three years we have invested more than $20 billion in the U.S. and we will continue to look at further investment opportunities here.""
He may not have to wait too long. With crude prices having fallen some 20% from last year’s peaks, many operators in the shale patch are once again running into financial constraints. Baker Hughes’ oil rig count hit its lowest level since the start of 2018 last week, and oil services companies such as Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB) have already briefed investors about the slowdown they see coming in the U.S. upstream sector. 
To take one admittedly hypothetical example, the $5.6 billion from Alaska would have bought  BP  (LON:BP) less than 20% of shale bellwether Continental Resources (NYSE:CLR) last year; today it would buy a majority stake.
By 5 AM ET (0900 GMT),  BP  (LON:BP) was one of the best performers in the U.K. FTSE 100 with a 1.9% gain. The U.K.’s was one of few bourses to rise on Wednesday against a backdrop of continued fears about global growth, with even the 0.4% gain in the FTSE 100 largely a result of sterling’s drop in response to news of the government’s latest maneuver to force through Brexit on Oct. 31.
Other markets were broadly lower, with the Stoxx 600 down 0.4% at 372.22, and the German DAX down 0.5%. Italy’s FTSE MIB outperformed with a decline of only 0.2%, as investors clung to hopes of a new government that would spare the country snap elections in the autumn. A decision on the outcome of talks between the Five Star Movement and Democratic Party isn’t expected until after the market close."

KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysian prosecutors on Wednesday said former prime minister Najib Razak abused his power to cover up the theft of hundreds of millions of dollars from the state fund 1MDB and used the fund for self-gratification.
On the opening day of the biggest trial in the 1MDB financial scandal, prosecutor Gopal Sri Ram said Najib used his position to evade justice, especially after news of the scandal broke in July 2015.
""He interfered with the course of investigation of the case which has come to be known as the 1MDB scandal,"" Gopal told the Kuala Lumpur High Court in his opening statement. ""He took active steps to effect a cover-up of his criminal acts.""
Malaysian and U.S. authorities have alleged that about $4.5 billion was misappropriated from 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB), co-founded by Najib in 2009.
Najib was voted out of power last year amid widespread public anger over the scandal, and has since been charged with 42 criminal offences linked to losses at 1MDB and other state entities. He has denied any wrongdoing and says the charges against him are politically motivated.
In his second trial on Wednesday, Najib faces 21 charges of money laundering and four charges of abuse of power for allegedly receiving illegal transfers of at least 2.3 billion ringgit ($550.8 million) between 2011 and 2014.
The prosecution said Najib used 1MDB as a vehicle ""to obtain gratification for himself"".
MAN IN THE MIRROR
The prosecution argued that Najib had not acted alone, colluding on numerous occasions with fugitive financier Low Taek Jho, better known as Jho Low, to set up and carry out abnormal financial transactions ""with undue haste"".
Low, who faces criminal charges in Malaysia and the United States over his alleged central role in the 1MDB case, has consistently denied wrongdoing and his whereabouts are unknown.
""If you place the accused before a mirror, you will see Jho Low. And if you place Jho Low before a mirror, you will see the accused,"" Gopal said.
Najib's defense team has argued that he was misled by various individuals, particularly Low, in dealings related to 1MDB.
""He (Low) misled the bank, he misled 1MDB...so to say my client is the alter ego, I'd like to see them prove it,"" Najib's lawyer, Shafee Abdullah, told reporters outside the court.
Shafee also contested the prosecution's argument that Najib and Low had fabricated documents to state that $100 million in donations had come from an Arab donor, saying Najib ""believed honestly"" that the money had come from the king of Saudi Arabia.
GOLDMAN SACHS DEALS
Gopal told the court that Najib and Low had colluded to raise more than $5 billion to fund the acquisition of two energy companies, though part of the sum went to accounts linked to Low while Najib was paid more than 90 million ringgit ($21.48 million).
The funds raised include two $1.75-billion bond issuances arranged by Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), which netted the bank a total payout of $302.5 million in arranger's fees.
Goldman earned another $279 million as arranger of a $3-billion loan to fund a ""sham"" joint-venture project between 1MDB and Aabar Investments PJS to build the Tun Razak Exchange tower. Gopal said Najib ultimately received $681 million from the deal.
Goldman has appointed a team of Malaysian lawyers to monitor the trial, which continues on Thursday.
After the shock election loss, Najib and his wife Rosmah Mansor were barred from leaving Malaysia and scrutiny of their luxurious lifestyle uncovered nearly $300 million worth of goods and cash at properties linked to him.
Rosmah, known for her designer handbags and jewelry, has also been charged with corruption. She has pleaded not guilty.
Wednesday's proceedings began a day after the prosecution wrapped up its case in Najib's first trial, where he is accused of illegally receiving $10 million from SRC International, a former 1MDB unit.
Lawyers are expected to submit closing arguments in that case in October, with the judge to rule by Nov. 11.

LONDON (Reuters) - A forgery crisis is quietly roiling the world's gold industry.
Gold bars fraudulently stamped with the logos of major refineries are being inserted into the global market to launder smuggled or illegal gold, refining and banking executives tell Reuters. The fakes are hard to detect, making them an ideal fund-runner for narcotics dealers or warlords.
In the last three years, bars worth at least $50 million stamped with Swiss refinery logos, but not actually produced by those facilities, have been identified by all four of Switzerland's leading gold refiners and found in the vaults of JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM)., one of the major banks at the heart of the market in bullion, said senior executives at gold refineries, banks and other industry sources.
Four of the executives said at least 1,000 of the bars, of a standard size known as a kilobar for their weight, have been found. That is a small share of output from the gold industry, which produces roughly 2 million to 2.5 million such bars each year. But the forgeries are sophisticated, so thousands more may have gone undetected, according to the head of Switzerland's biggest refinery.
""The latest fake bars ... are highly professionally done,"" said Michael Mesaric, the chief executive of refinery Valcambi. He said maybe a couple of thousand have been found, but the likelihood is that there are ""way, way, way more still in circulation. And it still exists, and it still works.""
Fake gold bars - blocks of cheaper metal plated with gold - are relatively common in the gold industry and often easy to detect.
The counterfeits in these cases are subtler: The gold is real, and very high purity, with only the markings faked. Fake-branded bars are a relatively new way to flout global measures to block conflict minerals and prevent money-laundering. Such forgeries pose a problem for international refiners, financiers and regulators as they attempt to purge the world of illicit trade in bullion.
High gold prices have triggered a boom in informal and illegal mining since the mid-2000s. Without the stamp of a prestigious refinery, such gold would be forced into underground networks, or priced at a discount. By pirating Swiss and other major brands, metal that has been mined or processed in places that would not otherwise be legal or acceptable in the West – for example in parts of Africa, Venezuela or North Korea – can be injected into the market, channeling funds to criminals or regimes that are sanctioned.
It is not clear who is making the bars found so far, but executives and bankers told Reuters they think most originate in China, the world's largest gold producer and importer, and have entered the market via dealers and trading houses in Hong Kong, Japan and Thailand. Once accepted by a mainstream gold dealer in these places, they can quickly spread into supply chains worldwide.
Word of the forged bars began to circulate quietly in gold industry circles after the first half of 2017, when J.P. Morgan, one of five banks which finalize trades in the $10 trillion-a-year London gold market, found that its vaults contained at least two gold kilobars stamped with the same identification number, 10 people familiar with the matter told Reuters. Reuters couldn't determine exactly where the vaults were.
J.P. Morgan declined to directly address questions about the fraudulent bullion, or comment on any of the details in this story. ""It's our standard practice to immediately alert the appropriate authorities and refineries should we discover mismarked gold kilobars during routine checks and procedures,"" the bank said in a statement. ""Fortunately, we have yet to have an incident resulting in a loss to the firm or a client."" 
The Shanghai Gold Exchange, which regulates China's gold market, said in a statement it was not aware of counterfeit bars being made in or transported through China. ""The Shanghai Gold Exchange has established a thorough delivery and storage system. The process for gold (material) to enter the warehouse is strictly managed and in compliance with the regulations,"" it said.
When others who store and trade such gold found forged bars, they returned them to the refiner concerned, some of whom have operations in Asia. Bars returned to Switzerland have been reported by refiners to the Swiss authorities who impounded them, refiners said.
Swiss Customs said 655 forged bars were reported in 2017 and 2018 to local prosecutors in Ticino, a region bordering Italy that contains three of Switzerland's four large refineries. ""In all cases the marking of the 1 kg bars were fake,"" a Customs official said by email, without commenting further.
The public prosecutor in Ticino confirmed it had received three reports of gold bars with suspect serial numbers, but said it could not disclose more information. The police in Neuchatel, where Switzerland's other large refinery is located, said neither it nor local prosecutors there had received reports of any forged bars. Switzerland's Attorney General said its office was not concerned with the topic at present.
Refinery executives said forged bars had also been reported in other countries.

HANDY FORMAT
Kilobars are small - around the size and thickness of a cellphone - unlike the roughly 12.5-kilo gold ingots typically stored in the vaults of the world's central banks. Kilobars are the most common form of gold in circulation around the world, passing fluidly between banks, refineries, dealers and individuals. The identifying features stamped onto a bar's surface include the logo of the refinery that made it, its purity, weight, and a unique identification number. Each one is worth around $50,000 at current prices. 
In parts of Southeast Asia, it's not uncommon for individuals to use gold instead of cash for big purchases such as real estate, bankers and analysts said. ""It's the only investment tool that goes from institutional investors like banks to the public and back again,"" said an executive at a Swiss refinery. 
In China, almost all exports of gold are banned as part of the country's strict, longstanding controls on capital movements. That, market analysts say, has spurred demand among well-to-do Chinese who want to send money out of the country to find ways to smuggle it. 
An estimated 400 to 600 tonnes of gold are snuck every year across the border from mainland China to Hong Kong in car boots and delivery vans, most of it in kilobars, said Cameron Alexander, head of precious metals research at consultants GFMS Refinitiv, which conducts detailed studies of global gold flows. Hong Kong Customs said it had received no complaints in the past decade about kilobars with forged trademarks.
Japan also has a long-established problem of gold smuggling in which the forged brands could be put to use, refinery executives said.
Swiss brands are not the only ones to have been pirated, but are the most targeted due to their global reach, executives said. Switzerland's four largest refineries - Valcambi, PAMP, Argor-Heraeus and Metalor - process around 2,000-2,500 tonnes of gold a year, worth around $100 billion. Their trademarks are among the most common and trusted in the industry. PAMP and Metalor declined to comment on the record; Argor said there was always a risk brands would be counterfeited, and recommended people buy bars only from trusted distributors.
For recipients, the pirated bars pose a compliance threat: Anyone who holds such metal - including jewelers, banks and electronics firms - risks inadvertently violating global rules designed to keep metal of unknown or criminal origin out of circulation. The rules aim to staunch gold supplies that fund conflict, terrorism or organized crime, damage the environment or undermine national governments.
Governments in America and Europe are legislating to force banks and manufacturers of items such as jewelry and electronics to take more responsibility for their mineral suppliers. For example, a clause in the Dodd-Frank Act adopted by the United States obliges U.S. companies to disclose whether gold they use has come from countries in central Africa where it could have been mined to fund conflict.
Richard Hayes, chief executive of the Perth Mint in Australia, one of the world's largest refiners, said his company had not encountered fraudulently branded Perth Mint kilobars. But, given the experience of other refiners, he has no doubt they are circulating.
""It's a wonderful way of laundering conflict gold,"" he said. ""The gold is genuine, but it's not ethically sourced ... They look completely genuine, they assay correctly, and they weigh correctly as well."" 
The perfect appearance makes the bars highly effective. ""Because gold is completely fungible,"" Hayes said, ""you can bleed it into genuine production. It's very, very hard to control."" 
J.P. Morgan supplies gold from major refiners for many of the world's biggest banks, jewelers and investors, and the discovery of the forged bars in its vaults triggered a full review of the gold it held, market sources said. One said this sweep unearthed around 50 fraudulently-branded bars. Another said it found several hundred. J.P. Morgan did not comment. 
People in the industry familiar with the matter said the number of forged bars, and their high quality, meant their production must be well organized. An analysis of the bars' movements suggested they had been made in Asia, probably China, they said. But the gold in them could have been melted and re-melted after being mined anywhere. 
J.P. Morgan responded to its discovery by deciding to stop buying any gold in Asia that had not come freshly made from a small clutch of refineries it trusted, five people familiar with the decision said. J.P. Morgan declined to comment.
Other banks have also restricted gold purchases in Asia, 15 people in the industry said. ""Anything that has even the chance of being iffy they are not going to be involved in,"" said Alexander, the analyst at GFMS Refinitiv. 
Reuters approached five large banks that trade gold in Asia, several of which have vaulting facilities. HSBC declined to comment in detail but a spokesman said it only bought bars directly from a small group of refiners accredited, like the Swiss, by the London Bullion Market Association (LBMA). It said it had found no counterfeits. UBS did not comment on counterfeit bars, but said it only sells gold processed by LBMA-accredited refiners.  Standard Chartered  (LON:STAN) declined comment, saying ""this is not an issue that affects us."" ANZ said it buys previously cast bars from ""a select group of counterparties"" and its policy, which had not been changed by the counterfeits, was to re-melt and recast them before selling them on. No one from ICBC Standard was available to comment.
THREE NINES
The number of fake bars being found has dropped since 2017. But refiners say the forgeries are becoming increasingly sophisticated, so the problem may have grown. 
In 2017, Valcambi's Mesaric said, hundreds of bars were found stamped with the same identification number. The bars' markings also had spelling errors, flaws in logo images, or print that was too deep or shallow, other refiners said.
Today, the forgeries are more precisely made, using what appears to be sophisticated machinery, Mesaric said. There can still be giveaways, such as indentations from a robotic gripper or repeated imperfections in a cast mould. But these are easy to miss.
The most reliable way to identify the fakes is to test their purity. Gold is available on world markets in varying levels of purity: For professionally produced kilobars, the most common standard is 99.99% - known in the trade as ""four nines."" An analysis of three counterfeit-branded bars by one Swiss refinery showed that two of them were 99.98% pure, and the third 99.90%.
Though short of legitimate professional standards, even that level of purity is difficult to achieve, and takes advanced equipment to detect.
Swiss Customs said of the 655 bars reported to local prosecutors in Ticino, the purity fell slightly below 99.99% in some cases.
""The level of counterfeit is becoming really good. Even for us it is hard to tell,"" said a Swiss refinery executive who spoke on condition of anonymity. ""They are, however, slightly less pure because the people doing the counterfeits don't have the equipment we have."" 
TAMPER-PROOF INK, MICROSURFACE SCANS
The refineries are responding to the problem with technology. 
Metalor this year began to put spots of tamper-proof ink on its bars. Like the security features on banknotes, these display different features when viewed under certain light or through filters. PAMP and Valcambi perform a microsurface scan of their bars and supply machines or phone apps that can scan each one and verify whether their surfaces match the refinery's records. Argor said its bars had various security features, but declined to elaborate for security reasons.
The LBMA, which accredits global refineries to vouch for the quality of their output, is drawing up standards for security features. It has also proposed a global database containing information about every kilobar produced, as a way of cross-checking the products to add an extra layer of security. ""Any security feature can be duplicated that's on the bar itself,"" said the LBMA's chief executive, Ruth Crowell. 

But most of the refiners' security features have only been introduced recently, and no database is planned until 2020 at the earliest.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's most costly consumer banking scandal could yet have a sting in the tail even after an August 29 compensation deadline, as a 1 billion pound claims industry takes its fight to the courts.
The payment protection insurance (PPI) saga is due to close on Thursday after eight years and 36 billion pounds ($44 billion) of compensation payouts to consumers who were mis-sold policies on a vast scale.
But banks have been warned that PPI has created a burgeoning claims industry and that celebrating the end of the scandal could be premature.
Several claims firms told Reuters they would continue to pursue PPI payouts through the courts, while others re-train staff to seek compensation for mis-selling of other products including investments and high-cost credit.
""People may have thought the deadline would be the end of it, but it may not go away,"" said Ian Bond, a director at law firm Talbots Law who works on PPI claims.
Think tank New City Agenda last week estimated the total bill for PPI would top 50 billion pounds, or five times the cost of the London 2012 Olympics.
It also estimated billions of pounds would likely remain unclaimed, leaving fertile ground for claims firms to exploit.
Britons could scarcely have missed reminders of the PPI claims deadline after being bombarded by adverts fronted by actor-turned-U.S. politician Arnold Schwarzenegger, paid for by watchdog the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).
PPI policies were sold alongside a personal loan or mortgage to cover repayments if borrowers fell ill or lost jobs but most were sold unsuitable policies and would never have been able to claim.
Most people have sought compensation directly with their bank, but a sizeable industry also emerged to handle claims.
Ten of the largest claims firms employ more than 3,000 people between them and have amassed 1.1 billion in revenues over the claims period, according to Companies House documents.
Some banks have been caught out by a late surge in PPI claims, forcing Lloyds (L:LLOY), HSBC (L:HSBA) and the UK arm of Spanish bank Santander (MC:SAN) to set aside an extra 1.1 billion pounds collectively in half-year results.
Others, including Clydesdale Bank (L:CYBG) and  Barclays  (L:BARC), are likely to make further provisions once the full bill is known.
Tony Shields, co-founder of claims firm Crystal Legal Services, is determined to pursue banks through the courts long after the PPI deadline.
He says the number of claims his firm dealt with this month leapt to 70,000, up five-fold on a typical month, with most on behalf of charities or families left money by people who have passed away.
""If you think about the deceased market, the people who have passed in the last 30 years of the scandal ... it's widely recognized that executors should have been checking the estates of those folks for PPI,"" Shields said.
THE NEXT SCANDAL?
The banks have mostly been contrite about their PPI sins but frustrations with claims pushed by middle-men are clear.
Barclays Finance Director Tushar Morzaria said in July that claims firms were ""swamping the bank with vexatious claims.""
The FCA said last week some claims firms were using misleading and unfair advertising practices to win business.
A spokesman for banking trade association UK Finance advised anyone with a complaint to deal directly with their bank.
Claim firms say they have cleaned up their act and some have moved on from PPI to pursuing claims in other areas.
Michael Jordan, development manager at Goodwin Barrett, said customers were becoming increasingly aware of rights to compensation on loss-making investments, particularly if risks were inadequately explained or the client’s judgment was impaired for any reason at the point of sale.
Dr Jasmine Murray and her husband invested 50,000 pounds in an investment portfolio offered by Abbey National - now part of Santander - shortly after relocating from London to Reading in southern England.
Murray had hoped the investment would top up their income as they got older but it lost 6,000 pounds in value, prompting them to withdraw their remaining 44,000 pound investment.
""We were both in shock and the bank didn't give us any good kind of explanation,"" she told Reuters. ""They just said 'No, that's it, you knew what you were getting into'.""
Murray used claims firm Goodwin Barrett, which argued Santander did not adequately explain the risks of the product. Murray obtained a payout of 13,590 pounds, of which 5,708 pounds went to Goodwin Barrett.
A spokesman for Santander said: ""We have apologized to Dr Murray over the advice she received in 2006 and paid appropriate compensation.""
The experience left Murray, who was widowed in 2014, with a deep mistrust of banks.
""I use them because I can't do any better. But I just feel people like me who need a little bit of handholding - they don't look after us."""
1188,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 28, 2019 01:41AM ET</span>","HSBC to cut fees, offer rebates to boost struggling small Hong Kong firms","HONG KONG (Reuters) - HSBC said on Wednesday it will offer rebates and fee reductions for small and medium-sized companies in Hong Kong, as the city's economy struggles.
Hong Kong is on the verge of its first recession in a decade, weighed down by the prolonged U.S.-China trade war and months of anti-government protests that have spread across the territory, disrupting traffic, scaring away tourists and paralyzing shopping areas.
HSBC, the biggest bank operating in Hong Kong, said it would offer a six-month interest rate rebate on loans approved under official financing and loan guarantee schemes for small and medium enterprises (SMEs), fee subsidies for applications for the financing guarantee scheme, and reductions in transaction fees for businesses using HSBC's mobile payment service.
The London-headquartered lender did not quantify how much the measures will cost it. It is the only large lender in Hong Kong to have come up with the measures recently.
While HSBC offered fee subsidies for the financing guarantee scheme last year, its larger support packages for SMEs have come during times of significant economic stress for Hong Kong.
The last time the bank launched a package of SME support measures was in 2009 following the global financial crisis, according to a bank spokeswoman, and the time before that was in 2003 as the city was hard hit by the SARS outbreak.
Hong Kong is HSBC's single biggest market, accounting for 52% of the bank's $12.4 billion in first-half pretax profits this year.
SMEs account for over 98% of local enterprises and around 45% of total employment, Terence Chiu, HSBC's head of commercial banking in Hong Kong, said in a statement on Wednesday.
""We have spent time listening to our customers and have heard their voices at this difficult time,"" Chiu said. The statement did not refer to the political protests directly.
The Hong Kong Retail Management Association, which represents more than 8,000 businesses, urged all landlords last week to halve rents for six months and warned if the situation continued ""many retailers may have to sack staff""."

1190,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 28, 2019 12:15AM ET</span>",Purdue Pharma in discussion on $10 billion-$12 billion offer to settle opioid lawsuits: sources,"By Mike Spector and Jessica DiNapoli
(Reuters) - OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma LP and its owners, the Sackler family, are in discussion to settle more than 2,000 opioid lawsuits against the company for $10 billion to $12 billion, two people familiar with the matter said on Tuesday.
Purdue is among several drugmakers and distributors that have been sued for fueling an opioid addiction crisis in the United States, which claimed 400,000 lives from 1999 to 2017, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The lawsuits have accused the Stamford, Connecticut-based Purdue Pharma of aggressively marketing prescription opioids while misleading prescribers and consumers about risks from their prolonged use. Purdue and the Sacklers have denied the allegations.
Purdue said it was actively working with state attorneys general and other plaintiffs to reach a resolution, without specifying a settlement amount.
There is currently no agreement and the settlement discussions could collapse, the sources said.
Representatives for Purdue and the Sackler family held discussions with cities, counties and states on the contours of the potential multibillion-dollar settlement last week in Cleveland, said a person familiar with the matter.
During the meeting, Purdue outlined a plan to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection as a mechanism for implementing the settlement, which the company hopes will address the lawsuits, the person said.
The Sacklers would cede control of Purdue under the settlement terms discussed last week, the person said.
All the parties face a Friday deadline to update a federal judge on the status of the negotiations, the person said.
The company has said the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved labels for OxyContin that warned about risk and abuse associated with treating pain. The Sacklers have argued they were passive board members who approved routine management requests rather than micromanaging the marketing of OxyContin.
RESTRUCTURING
The settlement offer was first reported by NBC. Paul Hanly, a lead attorney for the plaintiffs, in an email, replied only ""Made up. Ridiculous,"" when asked to confirm NBC's report. Asked to clarify after Reuters confirmed the report, he did not respond.
Representatives for the Sackler family declined to comment and a representative for the state attorneys general did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The plan under discussion envisions Purdue restructuring into a for-profit ""public benefit trust"" that would last for at least a decade, one of the people familiar with the matter said.
Purdue would contribute between $7 billion and $8 billion to the trust, with some of the money coming from the sales of its drugs, including those that combat opioid overdoses, the person said. Additional payments would come from the company's cash and insurance policies, the person said. Three experts would be approved by a bankruptcy judge as trustees who would select board members to run the trust, this person said.
The Sackler family, which has amassed an estimated $13 billion fortune over the years, is also weighing a possible sale of another pharmaceutical firm it owns called Mundipharma, with some of the proceeds potentially going toward the settlement under discussion, the person said. The settlement terms contemplate the Sacklers initially contributing $3 billion.
David Sackler, one of a handful of family members who previously sat on Purdue's board, has taken on a significant role in the recent discussions, which included at least 10 state attorneys general, the person said.
Purdue is set on Oct. 21, along with several other drug manufacturers and distributors, to face the first trial to result from federal court proceedings that have consolidated around 2,000 lawsuits brought largely by local governments accusing the companies of fueling the epidemic.
Other companies set to face trial include drugmakers Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (NYSE:TEVA) Ltd and Johnson & Johnson and drug distributors McKesson Corp (NYSE:MCK),  Cardinal Health  Inc (NYSE:CAH) and AmerisourceBergen (NYSE:ABC) Corp.
U.S. District Judge Dan Polster in Cleveland, Ohio, who oversees the lawsuits, has been pushing for settlements that could ""do something meaningful to abate this crisis.""
Purdue, the Sacklers and the communities involved face high-stakes negotiations and Purdue has been preparing for filing for bankruptcy protection in case it cannot reach an agreement.
Going into Chapter 11 would give Purdue the exclusive right for several months to propose a reorganization plan, which if approved by a U.S. bankruptcy judge could be forced on any local governments that decide to hold out.
Some state attorneys general have said they will resist any attempt by Purdue to use bankruptcy.
New York Attorney General Letitia James subpoenaed Wall Street banks, Purdue corporate entities and family offices in mid-August for records related to the Sackler family's finances, according to court records.
In a letter to a judge and an earlier lawsuit, her office characterized payouts to the Sacklers from Purdue as fraudulent conveyances, a legal designation for clawing back money during bankruptcy proceedings.
""The opioid epidemic has ravaged American communities for over a decade, while a single family has made billions profiting from death and destruction,"" James said in a statement. ""We won’t let up until we have delivered justice.”
A lawyer representing the Sackler family said in a statement that the New York attorney general's ""current claims are without merit and the subpoenas are improper."""
1191,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 27, 2019 10:32PM ET</span>","Hyundai Motor agrees wage deal, avoids strike for first time in eight years","By Hyunjoo Jin
SEOUL (Reuters) -  Hyundai Motor  Co (KS:005380) and its South Korean workers' union have reached a tentative wage deal and averted strike action for the first time in eight years, sending the automaker's shares up by more than 4%.
The union said it took into account ""the uncertain political and economic situation"" stemming from a diplomatic spat with Japan as well as a U.S.-China trade dispute.
Hyundai's unionized workers in South Korea have staged strikes in all but four years since the union was created in 1987. But the union has faced growing public and media criticism for walking out of wage talks despite workers' relatively high pay and at a time of economic slowdown.
""We have focused on escaping social isolation,"" the union said in a statement.
The deal is subject to approval from union members in a vote on Monday.
South Korea has been dropped from Japan's ""white list"" of countries with fast-track trade status, effective Wednesday, deepening a decades-old dispute over the countries' wartime history and dimming South Korea's economic outlook.
The U.S.-China trade war meanwhile is playing havoc with global supply lines and markets vital to South Korea's major exporters including automakers.
Hyundai and the union reached their deal ""to survive in the future"" amid the uncertain business environment and rapidly changing auto industry bent on electrification and autonomous vehicles, the carmaker said in a statement.
'GOOD DEAL'
Under the latest wage agreement, each unionized worker will receive a one-off payment of up to 9 million won ($7,414), an additional payment equivalent to one and a half months' salary, 15 Hyundai Motor shares, and a basic salary increase of 1.74%.
The basic salary increase is the lowest since at least the 2009 global economic downturn.
After the agreement, Hyundai shares rose as much as 4.4% in morning trade as worries eased about any production disruption damping its earnings recovery.
""It is a good deal. It will reduce risks to Hyundai's earnings,"" said analyst Lee Jae-il at Eugene Investment & Securities, adding the rise is less than expected.
""The union staged a strike to get a better wage deal from the company. But as profit is sagging, it's having a reality check,"" Lee said.
After six consecutive years' of profit decline, earnings have been recovering this year as favorable currency exchange and new sport-utility vehicles (SUV) offset a sales slump in China.
A consumer boycott of Japanese cars brought about by the diplomatic spat is also likely to help Hyundai's domestic sales, particularly of its higher-margin premium brand Genesis, analysts said.

The wage agreement will help Hyundai avert production losses as it tries to regain ground in the U.S. market with its new Palisade SUV, shipped from South Korea.

1192,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 27, 2019 09:06PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Financial hit from 737 MAX will not slow appetite for services deals - Boeing CEO,"By Eric M. Johnson
EVERETT, Wash. (Reuters) - Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co's chief executive said on Tuesday that the financial fallout from the grounding of its 737 MAX jetliner would not slow the world's largest planemaker's appetite for deals in the higher-margin aircraft services sector.
""Our ability to do those continues to be strong,"" Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg told Reuters at the company's widebody manufacturing plant north of Seattle, referring to acquisitions it has made to enlarge its two-year-old Global Services division.
""We have the financial capacity to manage the MAX situation and continue to make our investments for the future,"" he said.
Boeing's fastest-selling, single-aisle jet was grounded in March after two deadly crashes. The company is working on a fix for software at the center of both crashes and is aiming to get the jet back in the air as soon as October. It has completed around 560 flights with the new software, Muilenburg said on Tuesday.
""We still anticipate getting the return-to-service early in the fourth quarter,"" Muilenburg said. ""We are making progress on that schedule.""
Meanwhile, Muilenburg aims to expand the services business that includes aircraft parts, maintenance and analytics to $50 billion in revenue in a decade from its 2018 revenue of about $17 billion.
Boeing bought parts distributor KLX Inc last year for $4.25 billion including debt, in its largest deal since merging with McDonnell Douglas in 1997. Boeing and rival Airbus SE are pushing into the market for repairs, maintenance and analytics as airlines consider outsourcing more of such services in an effort to keep a lid on costs.
RAMP-UP AHEAD
Boeing has had to divert resources to the 737 MAX from across the company as it works to win approval from aviation regulators for its software upgrade.
In April, Boeing dropped production to the current rate of 42 aircraft per month after halting deliveries of the MAX to airlines, cutting off a key source of cash and hitting margins. The total cost of the 737 MAX crisis has grown to more than $8 billion and counting.
Reuters reported last week that Boeing told suppliers it will ramp back up to pre-crash production rates of 52 aircraft per month in February and reach a record 57 aircraft per month in June. Investors took that as a sign of optimism that the MAX will fly again commercially as early as October.
""We are also working with our supply chain on future rates,"" Muilenburg said on Tuesday. ""This is all consistent with that October return to service date.""
However, Muilenburg reiterated the timeline for rate increases and the return to service is in the hands of regulators, which will decide when the MAX can fly again commercially.
Although the MAX issue has diverted engineering resources and attention from other aircraft programs, Muilenburg said development work on a potential new middle-of-the-market aircraft, or NMA, ""hasn't been halted.""
""We have major risk reduction activities underway that are helping us protect the entry-into-service target date that we talked about,"" he said, referring to an entry-into-service date of 2025. ""We are still on that same macro path. We will make that decision when we are ready.""
Boeing's plane must enter the market in 2025, when airlines will be retiring Boeing 757s and 767s, with Airbus poised to scoop up new plane orders.
Muilenburg also said on Tuesday that an aircraft order from China could result from any deal to end a yearlong trade war between the U.S and China, the world's two largest economies."

LONDON (Reuters) - Nearly a third of the companies in Britain's FTSE 100 index of blue chip firms have agreed to cut pension payments for executives, the Investment Association said on Wednesday, amid increasing scrutiny of the gap between bosses' and ordinary workers' pensions in Britain.
In February, the Investment Association, which represents big asset managers, said a company would be ""red-topped"" if it did not explicitly state that any new executive director would have pension contributions set in line with the majority of employees.
A red top is the highest level of warning used for companies where shareholders should have the most serious concerns, though the Investment Association has no formal power over how investors vote on company policies.
The aim is to stop pensions being used as a mechanism for increasing total pay.
A total of 30 FTSE 100 companies have made significant changes as a result of the campaign, the Investment Association said.
""Shareholders will continue to focus on bringing executive pensions in line with majority of the workforce over the next 12 months,"" Chris Cummings, the Investment Association's CEO, said in a statement.
""Companies that do not take on board shareholder concerns risk facing yet more shareholder rebellions next year.""
Of the 30 companies that have made changes, 17 have said that any new director will be given a pension contribution that is in line with the one given to the majority of staff, the Investment Association said in a statement.
Three companies have appointed new directors with a pension contribution in line with the majority of employees, six other companies have reduced contributions for existing and future executives and four companies have also reduced pension contribution for incumbent directors immediately, the Investment Association said.
""There is now more transparency than ever around the UK’s biggest companies and these results show that important issues of excessive executive pay and diversity on boards are starting to be taken seriously,"" British Business Secretary Andrea Leadsom said in a statement.
The Investment Association has also said that Britain's top companies will face a red warning if they do not have more than one woman on their board, adding to pressure for more female representation at top levels of management.
Ratings on all aspects of a company's governance are done three weeks before its annual shareholders' meeting."
1194,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 27, 2019 07:11PM ET</span>","After blacklisting, U.S. receives 130-plus license requests to sell to Huawei: sources","By Alexandra Alper and Karen Freifeld
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Commerce Department has received more than 130 applications from companies for licenses to sell U.S. goods to China's Huawei Technologies Co Ltd, three sources said, nearly two months after President Donald Trump said some sales would be allowed.
But the Trump administration has not yet granted any licenses for sales to the blacklisted company, said the people familiar with the process who spoke to Reuters on the condition of anonymity.
The standstill coincides with mixed messages from Trump in the U.S.-China trade war, which have dimmed hopes for prompt decisions on license applications to sell to Huawei, the world's top producer of telecoms equipment.
That has raised the specter of billions of dollars of lost sales for chipmakers, software companies and others in Huawei's U.S. supply chain.
""Nobody in the executive branch knows what (Trump) wants and they're all afraid to make a decision without knowing that,"" said William Reinsch, a former Commerce department official.
Last week, Trump vowed to raise tariffs on $550 billion in Chinese imports, hours after China imposed new levies on $75 billion in U.S. goods. Then he softened his tone toward China at the G7 leaders' meeting over the weekend, saying he thought the world's two largest economies would reach a deal to end the tit-for-tat trade war that has roiled markets and hammered growth.
The current number of license applications, not previously reported, far exceeds the 50 or so that U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross disclosed receiving in July.
A spokesman for the Commerce Department said: ""The interagency process, weighing license requests concerning Huawei and its non-U.S. affiliates, is currently ongoing.""
Huawei did not immediately respond to a request for comment but has called for the United States to remove the company from the so-called entity list and put an end to what it called ""unjust treatment.""
Huawei, the world's no. 2 smartphone maker, was placed on the list because of U.S. national security concerns in May, when trade talks with China broke down. Sales of U.S. goods are mostly banned to companies on the list, unless suppliers obtain special licenses, which must overcome tough scrutiny.
The United States says the company can spy on customers and has sought to convince allies to exclude it from 5G networks. Huawei denies the allegations.
PROMISE
Seeking to lure China back to the negotiating table in late June, Trump promised President Xi Jinping that U.S. companies would be allowed to make some sales to Huawei, a gesture welcomed by U.S. chipmakers and software companies. Huawei spent $11 billion on U.S. components from U.S. firms such as  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC), Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) and Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) last year.
Government officials urged U.S. companies to apply for licenses following Trump's pledge of relief, saying exports to Huawei of non-sensitive items that are readily replaced by foreign competitors would be permitted. Ross and Trump in July promised timely responses.
One of the sources noted that the review process was not delayed, pointing to the complexities of interagency consultation.
But the only relief seen by Huawei thus far was the extension in August of the temporary general license, which gives U.S. companies a small exception to repair and maintain Huawei's existing handsets and networks.
China expert Derek Scissors of the American Enterprise Institute said a breakthrough in U.S.-China trade talks could spur license approvals for Huawei as soon as next month.
The two trade teams are due to meet in September in Washington, but no specific dates have been disclosed.
According to three Commerce department officials, many of the licenses requests have been reviewed by other agencies such as the Departments of State and Defense.
However, no standards have yet been set and no responses have been issued as officials await a green light from Ross and the White House, according to three people familiar with the process.  
The United States has a case pending against Huawei over allegations Huawei violated U.S. sanctions on Iran.
Huawei Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou has been detained in Vancouver since December on U.S. bank fraud charges for misleading banks about the company's Iran business. Trump has at times asserted that Huawei and Meng could be included in a grand U.S.-China trade deal."
1195,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 27, 2019 06:51PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Boeing CEO eyes major aircraft order under any U.S.-China trade deal,"By Eric M. Johnson
EVERETT, Wash. (Reuters) - Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co said on Tuesday that an aircraft order from China could result from any deal to end a yearlong trade war between the world's two largest economies.
Speaking to Reuters at the planemaker's widebody aircraft factory in Everett, Boeing Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg cautioned that it was ""tough to predict"" the timing of a potential trade deal between the United States and China.
""It's been challenging,"" Muilenburg said. ""But I think ultimately they will find a solution because of the mutual interest, and we think our airplane business will be part of that ultimate solution.""
""We are hopeful that if there is a trade solution, it will be beneficial to airplane orders as well,"" he added, saying a healthy aerospace industry benefits both countries.
Chicago-based Boeing calls itself the top U.S. exporter and has delivered more than one out of every four jetliners it made last year to customers in China, where it forecasts demand for 7,700 new airplanes over the next 20 years valued at $1.2 trillion.
But tit-for-tat tariffs between the United States and China, which is poised to overtake the United States as the world's largest aviation market in the next decade, have slowed the global economy and forced Boeing to walk a geopolitical tightrope for more than a year.
On the one hand, Boeing has been increasing its industrial footprint in China as it aims to increase its sales lead over Europe's Airbus SE in Asia. On the other hand, executives have taken pains to avoid clashing with U.S. President Donald Trump who has repeatedly said the United States must take steps to protect American jobs and technology.
Analysts say China has been slow to order planes from both Boeing and Europe's Airbus SE as its economy wavers and it holds off major procurement decisions pending the outcome of the dispute with the United States.
""It's hard to predict whether or not a successful deal will be achieved,"" Muilenburg said. ""China's been not ordering airplanes over the last year, year and a half. That pent-up demand signal is still there. The airplane need is real.""
Reuters reported in March that the prospect of a major potential order for more than 100 jets, worth well over $10 billion at list prices, had increased as Washington and Beijing cited some progress in talks to resolve their months-long trade war.
Boeing's plane orders have also been clouded by the grounding of the planemaker's fast-selling 737 MAX jetliner in the wake of two crashes that killed 346 people.
'BALANCED SOLUTION'
Muilenburg's comments come after China's foreign ministry said on Tuesday it hopes Washington can create conditions for talks, but that it had not heard of any recent telephone call between the United States and China on trade.
Trump on Monday predicted a trade deal with China, citing what he described as increasing economic pressure on Beijing and job losses in China.
His comments calmed global markets that have been roiled by new tariffs. He also appeared to back off of his threat to order U.S. companies out of China.
""We've been advocates for finding a balanced solution,"" Muilenburg said. ""We are going to continue to do that."""
1196,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 27, 2019 06:21PM ET</span>",Philip Morris and Altria in merger talks as Marlboro fades and e-cigs light up,"By Uday Sampath Kumar and Greg Roumeliotis
(Reuters) - Marlboro maker Philip Morris International Inc (N:PM) said on Tuesday it was in talks to reunite in a merger with  Altria Group  Inc (N:MO) following its 2008 spin-off, as the tobacco giants seek to pool resources in the fast growing e-cigarette market.
The merger between the two companies, the biggest ever in the consumer sector and the fourth-largest deal of all time, would create a tobacco giant with a market capitalization of approximately $200 billion.
It would come two years after  British American Tobacco  Plc (L:BATS) bought out Reynolds American Inc (NYSE:RAI) for $49 billion, underscoring how the decline in cigarette smoking globally is pushing tobacco companies to seek scale and pool resources in their development of alternative products. 
Under the terms of the all-stock merger being discussed, Altria shareholders would receive no premium and own between 41% to 42% of the combined company, with Philip Morris shareholders owning the remainder, according to a source familiar with the matter who was not authorized to discuss the details publicly.
The board of the combined company would be split evenly between Philip Morris and Altria directors, the source said. If the deal negotiations prove successful, an agreement could be reached by the end of September, the source added.
The two U.S.-headquartered companies separated 11 years ago to focus on different geographic markets, at a time when tobacco stocks generated steady yields. Since then, the industry has been disrupted by a move away from traditional smoking into e-cigarettes and vaping. 
The two have responded with new offerings. Philip Morris, which operates outside the United States, has developed a heated tobacco product called iQOS. Altria, which operates in the United States and still sells Marlboro in the country, acquired a 35% stake in vaping company Juul Labs Inc last year for $12.8 billion.
Some analysts and investors fretted that the lack of geographic overlap between the two companies could limit the value of operational synergies. Philip Morris and Altria shares ended trading on Tuesday down 7.8% and 4%, respectively, giving the companies market capitalizations of $112 billion and $84.5 billion.
""There currently is no overlap in operations of both companies other than the IQOS licensing agreement in the U.S. As such there would be little in the way of cost synergies other than corporate overheads and better leafbuying power,"" Jefferies analysts said in a research note. 
Philip Morris and Altria see scope in consolidating their manufacturing operations to generate annual synergies of more than $800 million, according to the source.
Industry-wide cigarette sales volumes tumbled 4.5% on an adjusted basis in 2018, according to analysts at Cowen. Global sales of cigarettes were estimated at $714 billion last year, according to Euromonitor International.
GRAPHIC: Market Shares of Tobacco Companies Worldwide - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/PHILIP%20MORRIS-M-A-ALTRIA/0H001QESB82V/index.html
In contrast, the e-cigarette market was worth about $11 billion in 2018 and is expected to grow at more than 8% annually over the next five years, according to research firm Mordor Intelligence.
In April, Philip Morris won approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to sell iQOS in the United States. 
""With disruption facing the world of tobacco, we can see some merit in a re-merger,"" Bernstein analyst Callum Elliott said in a note. ""The combined entity - Philip Morris 2.0 - could present a united front"" on next-generation products such as iQOS, and ""go about a coordinated global brand-building exercise the same way Philip Morris originally built Marlboro."" 
SIMPLIFYING PARTNERSHIP 
Unlike combustible cigarettes, iQOS devices heat tobacco-filled sticks wrapped in paper, generating an aerosol that contains nicotine. They are different from e-cigarettes such as the popular Juul device, which vaporizes a nicotine-filled liquid.
Altria already can market iQOS in the United States under a licensing agreement, which includes royalty payments to Philip Morris. A merger between the two companies would simplify that agreement. The source close to the deal talks said the merger negotiations started as an extension of this partnership.
At the same time, Altria could tap into Philip Morris' global sales force to aid in Juul's international expansion. 
In a note to clients on Tuesday,  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) analyst Bonnie Herzog said a deal would create the leading global nicotine company by improving cash flow and accelerating the worldwide rollout of Juul and iQOS.
Philip Morris has annual revenue of nearly $30 billion, while Altria generated about $20 billion last year. Both companies said there could be no assurance a deal would be reached. 
Any deal would need to be approved by the companies' respective boards and shareholders.

1197,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 27, 2019 05:51PM ET</span>",Navigating the trade war: How to invest during turmoil,"By David Randall
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The start-and-stop progress of negotiations between the United States and China aimed at ending the trade war between the world's two largest economies is souring Wall Street playbooks and increasing market volatility as investors seek to profit during the uncertainty.
Investors are now focused on Sept. 1, when the first stage of U.S. tariffs on $300 billion worth of Chinese goods is scheduled to go into effect. In response, China unveiled tariffs on U.S. products ranging from soybeans to autoparts to small aircraft that are set to go into effect the same day.
Global stock markets rallied Monday after President Donald Trump said he expects to see a trade deal, then fell Tuesday after China's foreign ministry said it had not received any recent phone calls from the United States on trade.
Here are how some on Wall Street are navigating the trade dispute:
1) Phil Orlando, portfolio manager and chief equity market strategist at Federated Investors in New York, said the prospects of drawn-out trade discussions prompted him to lower his equity overweight from 8% to 3% in July.
""To some degree Trump is using Chinese trade issues as a means of trying to extract additional cuts from the Fed to bring interest rates down, believing that at some point in the future he has the ability to sit down with the Chinese and pull a deal together,"" he said.
If that were to occur, Orlando would move into an overweight into sectors like auto parts and agricultural that have been the focus on Chinese tariffs.
2) Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Cresset Capital Management in Chicago, said his firm reduced risk earlier this year.
""We are feeling pretty good about our reduced-risk position, obviously the risk is we have some sort of a market melt-up. But the likelihood of a market melt-up seems small given where valuations are, where yields are and where expectations are.""
3) Mark Haefele, global chief investment officer, global wealth management, at UBS AG, wrote in a research note this week: ""Downside risks are increasing for both the global economy and markets. As a result, we are reducing risk in our portfolios by moving to an underweight in equities to lower our exposure to political uncertainty.""
4) Strategists at JP Morgan say they are ""nearing the time to add back risk"" as they see a chance that the latest tariffs will not be implemented.
""While we have been advocating a consolidation call during August, we continue to expect that the pullback will not extend for longer than the May one did, and still believe that the market will advance into year-end, starting with a September upmove, as originally envisaged.""
Among the positives expected are ""with respect to tariffs, with a chance of the latest ones not being implemented after all.""
5) Derivatives strategists at JP Morgan suggested using equity options as a way to benefit from either an improvement or further deterioration in trade tensions.
""Current weak positioning and sentiment could turn around quickly on positive trade developments, and drive significant market upside,"" strategist Bram Kaplan said in a note on Tuesday.
Kaplan recommended buying S&P 500 options that make money in the event of a market rebound. He also recommended buying call options on stocks and sector exchange traded funds (ETFs) hardest hit by trade escalation to benefit from a possible rebound.
For companies that have so far largely escaped a hit from tariffs but remain vulnerable to a fresh round of tariffs in December, the strategists recommended buying December put options. These companies include  Nike  (N:NKE),  Estee Lauder  (N:EL) and Illinois Tool Works (N:ITW), according to JP Morgan."
1198,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 27, 2019 05:31PM ET</span>",Facebook expands 'Local Alert' tool in bid to help in emergencies,"By Arriana McLymore
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) announced on Tuesday that it was rolling out a tool that aims to provide users with potentially life-saving information in emergencies, as it seeks to improve its public image and play down its reputation as a network that aids the spread of misinformation.
Local Alerts, which it has been testing since last year in 300 cities including Charlotte, St. Louis and Miami and now plans to offer across the United States, is intended to provide reliable information to people caught up in events such as mass shootings and extreme weather, it said in a blog post.
Alongside other social media companies, Facebook has faced a barrage of international criticism for the way its platform has been used to spread conspiracy theories and extremist views and it is keen to focus attention instead on its role as a connector of friends and family.
The world's largest social media network already offers users the ability to let friends know they are safe during emergencies with a feature called Safety Check, but said it wanted to do more.
With Local Alerts, Facebook account holders in local government and among first responders such as the police and fire departments can send out messages that are then spread more widely by Facebook.
It was not immediately clear how useful the service was in its pilot phase. When asked if Local Alerts to date have been deployed quickly enough to make a difference or have been employed in situations where users were in danger, Facebook declined to give examples, citing the privacy of its account holders.
It also said the speed at which alerts were disseminated was dependent on the account holders.
In one example, when a disgruntled student opened fire during the last day of classes at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte in April, the City of Charlotte Government's Facebook page sent a Local Alert notifying nearby residents when it was safe to return.
The alert was posted more than two hours after the shooting, said Ken Brown, Charlotte's Interim Media Relations Manager.
Some local authorities contacted by Reuters said they were using Local Alerts alongside other services to warn citizens of danger. Mt. Juliet Police Department in Tennessee said it uses a combination of Facebook Local Alerts, mobile text messages through the Nixle platform, and posts on local community media service Nextdoor to send emergency notifications.
The local authorities said they had sent alerts over emergencies including road closures, bad weather, and missing people.
""I grew up in Kansas and this is the time of year when we get a lot of tornadoes,"" Jimmy O'Keefe, Facebook's head of Product Marketing for News Publishing, said. ""This tool would have given us a lot of peace of mind if it was around back then."""

1201,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 27, 2019 05:11PM ET</span>",Stocks - Skeptical Investors Push Wall Street Stocks Lower; Bonds Climb,"Investing.com - Stocks drifted lower Tuesday as investors appeared worried about the economic future.
Big growth stocks like UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) slumped, and there was weakness among a wide array of tech stocks.
The S&P 500 fell 0.32%. The Nasdaq Composite was off 0.34%, and the Dow Jones industrials dropped 0.47%, with UnitedHealth (NYSE:UNH) contributing 55 points of a 121-point loss.
The Dow's loss was equal to about 45% of the Dow's 270-point gain on Monday.
In addition, the 10-Year Treasury yield closed at 1.476%, its first close below 1.5% since August 2016, and the bond market produced an inverted yield curve with the 10-2 Year Treasury Yield Spread ending the day at negative 4.47 basis points, or 4.47 one hundredths of a percentage point.
Long-term rates falling below short-term rates has historically been a signal that, while the economy looks stable now, a recession could be ahead.
Much of Tuesday's drift lower was due to concerns about where the U.S.-China trade fight was headed next. The central government was looking for ways to stimulate the domestic Chinese economy. Gold was higher in response. The Trump Administration was relatively quiet, although President Donald Trump did criticize the Federal Reserve for not cutting interest rates fast enough.
The China uncertainty hit shares of a number of chip companies, which manufacture their products in China or sell chips to Chinese customers. These included   Western Digital   (NASDAQ:WDC), Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU), Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Xilinx (NASDAQ:XLNX).
Separately, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Cisco Systems(NASDAQ:CSCO), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) were lower.
A number of pharmaceutical stocks fell in response to an Oklahoma judge's decision Monday to order Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) to pay $572 million for its involvement in the opioid crisis.
Privately held Purdue Pharma reportedly offered $10 billion to $12 billion to settle litigation it faces.
Teva Pharma (NYSE:TEVA),   Mallinckrodt   (NYSE:MNK) and Endo International (NASDAQ:ENDP), all facing litigation over rampant opioid use, were down sharply. Johnson & Johnson was actually up 1.4%. 
 
Elsewhere, oil prices moved higher on expectations that oil-producing countries will be cutting production this fall. West Texas Intermdiate was up $1.29 to $54.93 a barrel. Brent crude for October delivery rose 81 cents to $59.51. The November contract closed at $59.03.

1202,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 27, 2019 05:01PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch,"Investing.com - Here are the top three things that could rock markets tomorrow. 
1. Tiffany Earnings Due
Tiffany & Co (NYSE:TIF) is slated to report second-quarter earnings results on Wednesday, before the opening bell. 
Worldwide spending will be closely watched after revenue in the first quarter got hit by a loss of spending by Chinese tourists amid the ongoing U.S.-China trade war. 
In its first quarter, Tiffany said it anticipated 2019 worldwide net sales increasing by a low single-digit percentage over the prior year and earnings per share growing by a low-to-mid-single-digit percentage.
Tiffany is expected to report earnings of $1.04 per share on revenue of $1.06 billion, according to consensus estimates from Investing.com.
2. Fed Jawboning on the Menu
As uncertainty over whether the U.S. and China will resume trade talks dominates market direction, investors will likely welcome the opportunity to hear from Federal Reserve members for further signs the U.S. central bank will cut its benchmark rate next month. 
Richmond Federal Reserve President Thomas Barkin will speak at 12:20 pm ET (4.20pm GMT). San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly will speak at 5:30 pm ET (9.30pm GMT.)
Expectations for an aggressive Fed rate cut at the central bank’s next meeting were dented by better-than-expected consumer confidence data, suggesting the U.S. economy remains on solid footing. 
While the Fed is still expected to cut rates in a few weeks, a sense that consumers remain largely shielded from the trade war implies a quarter point, rather than a half-point rate cut, BMO said.
3. U.S. Crude Inventories on Tap
The weekly EIA crude inventories data, due Wednesday, is expected to show oil stockpiles fell for a second-straight week, adding to the deeper production decline by major oil producers. 
The Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee of OPEC and non-cartel oil producers (OPEC+) reported today that OPEC+ production limits, in place since the end of last year, reached 159% compliance in July 2019, up 22 percentage points from a month earlier.
WTI futures snapped a four-day losing streak today to settle 2.4% higher at $54.37 a barrel. 
Crude production, which remains close to record highs, will also be in focus as domestic output appears to be tailing off.
""After hitting consistent record-high production levels earlier in the year, the pace of U.S. output has steadily slowed down, and oil could start to see more support as energy markets continue to tighten,” said Edward Moya, a market analyst at Oanda."
1203,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 27, 2019 04:29PM ET</span>",HP Enterprise Boosts Outlook as Q3 Earnings Top Estimates,"Investing.com - Hewlett Packard Enterprise reported better-than-expected earnings for its fiscal third quarter and raised its full-year guidance as an uptick in gross margins offset the impact of lower revenues. 
The company raised its full-year earnings forecast to a range of $1.72 to $1.76 a share from $1.62 to $1.72 previously, topping estimates for earnings of $1.68 a share from S&P Capital IQ. Hewlett Packard Enterprise (NYSE:HPE) was up more than 5% after the report in postmarket trading. 
The company reported earnings of 45 cents a share on revenue of $7.22 billion. That compared with consensus estimates from Investing.com for earnings of 40 cents a share on revenue of $7.29 billion. 
The earnings beat was driven by an increase in margins to 33.9% for the quarter, up 340 basis points from the prior-year period.
The 7% fall in revenues, meanwhile, comes as Hybrid IT revenue, which accounts for the bulk of growth, slipped 9.2% to $5.5 billion for the quarter from a year earlier. 
Its intelligent edge segment reported revenue of $785 million, down 2.9% from a year ago, and financial services revenue fell to $888 million from $928 million a year earlier. 
""In Q3, we improved both gross and operating margins, delivered strong non-GAAP earnings, and generated a record level of year-to-date free cash flow,"" said Antonio Neri, president and CEO of Hewlett Packard Enterprise. ""We also invested in important innovation for our customers and announced strategic acquisitions, including Cray, which we now expect to close by the end of fiscal year 2019, earlier than originally planned."""
1204,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 27, 2019 04:05PM ET</span>",BP to quit Alaska after 60 years with $5.6 billion sale to Hilcorp,"By Ron Bousso and Tanishaa Nadkar
(Reuters) - British oil major  BP  Plc (L:BP) on Tuesday agreed to sell all its Alaskan properties for $5.6 billion to privately held Hilcorp Energy Co, exiting a region where it operated for 60 years.
The deal, which includes interests in the most prolific oil field in U.S. history at Prudhoe Bay, and the 800-mile (1,300-km) Trans Alaska Pipeline, is part of BP's plan to raise $10 billion over the next two years through asset sales to further strengthen its balance sheet, it said.
For years, BP has been reducing its role in Alaska, where oil production for fallen with declines at the Prudhoe Bay field. BP, which began working in Alaska in 1959, is the operator and holds a 26% stake in Prudhoe, where production began in 1977. 
In 2014, BP sold Hilcorp half its share of an Alaskan project. This year, the two were due to decide whether to go ahead with an ambitious $1.5 billion offshore project that requires construction of a manmade island. 
The acquisition fits Hilcorp's historical strategy of acquiring mature fields from major oil companies and slashing costs. The company, founded in 1990 by Texas oilman Jeffery Hildebrand, has operations across the United States. 
A Hilcorp spokesman did not reply to a request for comment.
“This deal vaults Hilcorp to be the second-largest Alaska producer and reserves holder, behind only ConocoPhillips (N:COP),"" said Rowena Gunn, a Wood Mackenzie energy analyst. Hilcorp must show it can maintain output at Prudhoe Bay, where BP has been the operator, she said.
Prudhoe has to date produced over 13 billion barrels of oil and is estimated to have the potential to produce more than one billion further barrels. BP's net oil production from Alaska in 2019 is expected to average almost 74,000 barrels per day. 
The deal calls for a $4 billion initial payment to BP with the remaining $1.6 billion in earnout payments over time. 
""We are steadily reshaping BP and today we have other opportunities, both in the U.S. and around the world, that are more closely aligned with our long-term strategy and more competitive for our investment,"" BP Chief Executive Officer Bob Dudley said. 
The Alaska sale pushes BP closer to its goal of selling $10 billion of properties following the 2018 acquisition of BHP's (AX:BHP) U.S. shale assets, a $10.5 billion deal that catapulted the London-based company into a major Texas shale producer.
BP previously had said that most of the disposals would come from its shale assets, particularly natural gas fields. The sale would help BP reduce its debt, which rose to 31% of its market capitalization by the end of June.
The sale faces regulatory approvals, including by the state of Alaska. 
The divestment comes months after BP agreed to sell its interests in the Gulf of Suez oil concessions in Egypt to Dubai-based Dragon Oil for an undisclosed sum. 

BP also said about 1,600 employees were currently part of its Alaskan business, adding that it was ""committed to providing clarity about their future as soon as possible as part of the transition process with Hilcorp.""

1206,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 27, 2019 03:45PM ET</span>","U.S. yield inversion deepens, stokes recession fears","By Richard Leong
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. yield curve inversion deepened on Tuesday to levels not seen since 2007, rekindling fears of a looming recession that spurred a sell-off on Wall Street and stoked even more safe-haven demand for government bonds.
The intense interest in Treasuries supported demand for $40 billion worth of two-year government debt for sale, part of this week's $113 billion fixed-rate Treasury supply.
The yield curve often inverts prior to a U.S. recession.
""As the curve inverts further, it has inspired more long-end buying,"" said Mike Lorizio, head of Treasuries trading at Manulife Asset Management in Boston.
The Treasury Department sold its latest two-year, fixed-rate note supply at a yield of 1.516%, which was the lowest at an auction of this maturity since September 2017.
The Treasury will sell $41 billion of five-year notes on Wednesday, followed by a $32 billion auction of seven-year debt on Thursday. It will also offer $18 billion in floating-rate notes on Wednesday.
On the open market, 10-year Treasury yields were 1.488%, down 5.60 basis points on the day. They reached a three-year low of 1.443% on Monday.
The yields on two-year notes were 1.531%, down 2.00 basis points. On Monday, they declined to 1.449%, the lowest since September 2017.
The three major Wall Street indexes were lower, wiping out their initial increase.
The spread on three-month T-bill rates over 10-year yields grew as wide as 52 basis points, a level not seen since March 2007, according to Refinitiv data.
The deepening curve inversion reflects investors' nervousness about a recession and uncertainties over the trade conflict between China and the United States.
""It's not a sign of confidence in inflation or a pickup in growth,"" Lorizio said.
GRAPHIC: U.S. yield curve - http://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/4/168/168/U.S.%20Yield%20Curve%20Inversion.png
U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday said he expected a trade deal with China after positive gestures by Beijing following a global stock market rout last week.
China's Foreign Ministry said on Tuesday it had not heard of any recent telephone call between the United States and China on trade. This raised doubts whether the world's two biggest economies can reach a trade deal in the foreseeable future.
A closely followed J.P. Morgan survey suggested blistering demand for Treasuries has tapered a tad as the share of investors who said they were neutral on longer-dated U.S. government debt grew to 54% on Monday, up from 49% a week ago.
On the data front, U.S. consumer confidence weakened a bit in August even though consumers' optimism on their present situation hit its strongest level since late 2000, the Conference Board said.

1208,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 27, 2019 03:10PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Texas storage operator jumps into race to produce low-sulfur marine fuels,"By Collin  Eaton  (NYSE:ETN)
HOUSTON (Reuters) - A U.S. Gulf Coast fuel storage operator is launching its own crude processing facility to make 50,000 barrels per day (bpd) of low-sulfur fuels to comply with new environmental rules beginning in 2020, executives told Reuters on Tuesday. 
Texas International Terminals plans to operate its own crude distillation unit (CDU) at a site in Galveston, Texas, producing bunker and gas oil for affiliate GCC Bunkers, which will supply crude and market the resulting fuels. 
The previously undisclosed refining project, an unusual venture for a storage facility, will compete with big refinery operators such as  BP  Plc (L:BP),  Chevron  Corp (N:CVX) and  Exxon Mobil  Corp (N:XOM), and startups such as Limetree Bay Refining LLC. The plant aims to tap demand for very low-sulfur fuels required beginning Jan. 1 for ocean-going vessels under an International Maritime Organization (IMO) mandate. The IMO 2020 rule limits sulfur content to 0.5%, from 3.5%, to reduce air pollution. 
""We expect most of the bunker demand in the Houston and surrounding markets to shift to the IMO 2020 spec,"" said Mark VandeVoorde, a principal at GCC Bunkers. ""We anticipate there will be strong demand for the product."" 
Todd Sullivan, president of Texas International Terminals, declined to disclose the company's investment in the small-scale refinery and storage-terminal additions. The company expects to acquire low-sulfur Texas crudes for the operation and has already begun construction on the project, expected to be completed early next year.
Refiners' profit margins have already begun to rise as inventory builds in anticipation of sales beginning later this year, said Jan-Jaap Verschoor, director of Oil Analytics Ltd. He forecasts demand initially could outstrip supply by 250,000 bpd. 
The company operates a terminal with bunker storage capacity of 50,000 barrels at the plant site on the Galveston Ship Channel, and plans to add 750,000 barrels of fuel oil storage and 500,000 barrels of gas oil storage at the site, Sullivan said. 
""West Texas barrels can create compliant fuels,"" said John Auers, executive vice president at consultancy Turner, Mason & Co. ""The thing is, the existing refiners are making IMO-compliant fuels, as well. You've got to find a home for it."" 
Expansions to existing refineries since the early 1990s have added about 2.9 million bpd of crude refining capacity along the U.S. Gulf Coast, bringing the region's capacity to 9.8 million bpd, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

1209,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 27, 2019 03:01PM ET</span>",Papa John's hires Arby's head as CEO to drive turnaround,"(Reuters) - Papa John's International Inc on Tuesday named Arby's Restaurant Group Inc President Rob Lynch as its chief executive officer, replacing Steve Ritchie barely 19 months after he took the role, sending shares of the world's third-largest pizza chain up nearly 10%.
A former marketing executive at Yum Brands' Taco Bell and Procter & Gamble Co, Lynch will be tasked with turning around the company's struggling sales as it fights to get past the negative publicity surrounding its founder John Schnatter.
""(Lynch's) proven record transforming organizations and realizing the growth potential of differentiated brands is ideally suited for Papa John's as the company sets forth on its next chapter,"" said the company's chairman and hedge fund Starboard Value LP CEO, Jeff Smith.
Schnatter resigned as CEO in 2017 after he came under fire for criticizing the National Football League's leadership over national anthem protests by players, giving the role to Ritchie.
Starboard too has been pushing for a turnaround in sales after taking a stake in the company, which was worth $200 million in February. Papa John's chose Starboard over a rival offer from Schnatter.
""We believe new leadership will foster menu innovation and ignite faster pace of change at the company,"" BTIG analyst Peter Saleh said in a note.
Schnatter, who is the largest shareholder in the company, according to Refinitiv data, said he was pleased that the company made a change in leadership, adding that Lynch has proven to be an effective marketing leader in previous roles. 
Shares of Papa John's rose 9.7% to $48.06, adding to its 10% gain this year.
In a statement, Inspire Brands, the company that owns Arby's, said the sandwich chain's marketing head Jim Taylor would take over as president.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) said on Tuesday that it fined public accounting firm RSM US LLP $950,000 to settle claims it violated the agency's auditor independence rules.
The SEC said RSM, which says on its website it is the country's fifth-largest accounting firm, provided non-audit services to at least 15 of its audit clients, violating rules that bar audit firms from engaging in certain non-audit relationships while an audit is being conducted.
The non-audit services included corporate secretarial services, payment facilitation, payroll outsourcing and investment adviser services, among others.
RSM also failed to disclose its non-audit relationships in more than 100 audit reports for clients published between 2014 and 2015, violating disclosure rules, the SEC said.
RSM did not admit or deny the regulator's claims.
In addition to the fine, RSM also agreed to employ an independent consultant to evaluate its current quality controls for compliance, the SEC said in a statement.
""The SEC's auditor independence rules specifically prohibit audit firms from providing certain non-audit services,"" said Carolyn M. Welshhans, an official in the SEC's Division of Enforcement. ""Audit firms must put in place procedures, training, and systems that provide a reasonable assurance of independence, and they must monitor for independence on an ongoing basis.""
Terri Andrews, a spokeswomen for RSM US LLP, said the SEC's order ""makes no finding that RSM’s objectivity or impartiality – bedrock elements to auditor independence – were impaired.""
Andrews added that ""RSM supports the efforts by the SEC and accounting profession to review the application and impact of the independence rules in the context of performing non-audit services."""

The S&P 500, off 0.5%, fell for the third time in four sessions after Chinese officials questioned statements by President Donald Trump about trade discussions between the two countries. Banking shares led losses after the United States 10-Year yield fell below 1.50%. Philip Morris International (NYSE:PM) paced the decline after the company confirmed it was in merger talks with   Altria Group   (NYSE:MO). Tech companies also helped pull down indexes, with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) a top loser.
The euro fell following data showing Germany was on the brink of a recession, and the pound gained as opposition politicians stepped up efforts to prevent a no-deal Brexit. West Texas crude pared gains to trade around $54 a barrel.
Trump’s apparent deescalation of trade tensions at the G-7 had helped ease investors nerves before Beijing questioned some of those comments. Adding to that is the underlying caution about the global economy as Germany offered up fresh evidence that protectionism is weighing on global growth. Volatility remains relatively high as traders reflect on previous periods of calm in the trade war that were quickly ended by surprises.
“From Friday to now has been just head-spinning on the trade issue,” said David Donabedian, chief investment officer of CIBC Private Wealth Management. “I think the market rally was not so much because they took the president’s statement literally about China’s desire to get a deal done. I think it’s because they looked at the president’s statement and concluded he’s more anxious to get a deal done.”

1222,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 27, 2019 12:46PM ET</span>","U.S. appeals court revives aluminum antitrust cases vs Goldman, JPMorgan, Glencore","By Jonathan Stempel
NEW YORK (Reuters) - A federal appeals court on Tuesday revived lawsuits by aluminum purchasers that accused Goldman Sachs (N:GS), JPMorgan Chase (N:JPM), mining company  Glencore  (L:GLEN) and other companies of conspiring to drive up prices for the metal by reducing supply.
In a 3-0 decision, the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan said a federal judge erred in dismissing antitrust claims by ""direct"" purchasers of aluminum such as Novelis, and by other purchasers including Eastman Kodak (N:KODK), Fujifilm (T:4901) and Reynolds Consumer Products.
Purchasers accused banks and commodity trading, mining and metals warehousing companies of conspiring to hoard aluminum inventory earlier this decade, after prices had declined because industrial activity fell during the global financial crisis.
The purchasers said the alleged conspiracy led to delays in processing orders and higher storage costs, ultimately inflating the cost to produce cabinets, flashlights, soft drink cans, strollers and other goods containing aluminum.
Lawyers for the defendants did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Writing for the appeals court, Circuit Judge Pierre Leval said the purchasers could sue because they claimed to suffer harm in a market that the defendants allegedly restrained, the market to buy and sell primary aluminum.
He distinguished them from commercial end users and consumer end users, whose own antitrust claims were rejected by the appeals court in an August 2016 decision because their claimed injuries were too far removed from the alleged misconduct.
Leval faulted U.S. District Judge Katherine Forrest, who has since returned to private practice, for relying on that decision to conclude that any manipulation would have occurred in the warehousing market, not the primary aluminum market.
Unlike the end users, ""whose injury was an incidental byproduct of the defendants' alleged violation, these plaintiffs' injuries were a direct result of the defendants' anticompetitive conduct,"" Leval wrote.
The cases were returned to the federal court in Manhattan, where they are now overseen by U.S. District Judge Denise Cote.
""We're pretty excited,"" Patrick Coughlin, a lawyer for the direct purchasers, said in an interview.
""Even if manipulation took place in another market, if it were directed toward our clients' markets and inflated the price of aluminum there, we should be able to bring an antitrust case,"" he added. ""We're ready to go to trial.""
Lawyers for Kodak and Fujifilm, and a lawyer for Reynolds, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The case is Eastman Kodak Co et al v Henry Bath LLC et al, 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, Nos. 16-4230, 16-4233, 16-4235, 16-4243, 16-4305 and 16-4308."

The push comes as China threatens to curb exports to the United States of rare earths, a group of 17 minerals found in fighter jets, tanks and high-tech consumer electronics.
China is the world's largest processor and producer of the minerals. There are no known substitutes.
""We're concerned about any fragility in the supply chain and especially where an adversary controls the supply,"" Ellen Lord, the Pentagon's under secretary of defense for acquisition and sustainment, told reporters at a Washington event on Monday.
Lord said the Pentagon is looking at several options to partner on rare earth processing facilities, adding ""one of the highest potential avenues is to work with Australia.""
The Australian embassy to the United States in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
The Pentagon update came after the United States said earlier this year that it would look to Australia and Canada to develop rare earths reserves around the world to reduce the global reliance on China. The United States has also held talks with rare earths projects across Africa.
Lord said she has held several talks with Australian officials this year about whether such a plant could supply the Pentagon's needs.
U.S. President Donald Trump last month ordered the Pentagon to find better ways to procure a range of magnets made from rare earths, warning that the nation's defense would suffer without adequate stockpiles.
Australia's  Lynas Corp  (AX:LYC) is the world's largest rare earths miner and processor outside of China. It was not immediately clear if the Pentagon would partner with Lynas or another Australian entity.
Rare earth minerals need to be processed after they are extracted from the ground. There is only one operational rare earths mine in the United States, though the country has no processing facilities. 

California's Mountain Pass mine is building a processor and hopes to have it online by next year.

1229,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 27, 2019 11:52AM ET</span>",UK aviation authority questioning BA after cancelations row,"LONDON (Reuters) - The UK Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) is questioning British Airways after it enraged thousands of travelers by telling them their flights had been canceled after its pilots announced they would strike for three days next month.
Last Friday, the BALPA union said it would strike over pay on the 9th, 10th and 27th of September, prompting the airline to tell passengers by email that flights on or around those dates had been canceled.
The emails led to widespread confusion and anger as many people rebooked costly flights unnecessarily.
The CAA is exploring whether British Airways, part of the International Airlines Group (LON:ICAG) (IAG), failed to comply with European rules about airline passengers’ consumer rights.
It said in a statement: “We have been in contact with the airline to determine what has happened and are seeking an explanation to confirm how it complied with its rerouting obligations to consumers.”
It said passengers whose flights have been canceled should be offered the choice of reimbursement for canceled flights, alternate travel arrangements under comparable conditions or a new flight at a later date.
""We also expect airlines to proactively provide passengers with information about their rights when flights are canceled,” it added.
Passengers who were told their plans would be disrupted took to social media to complain.
“Disgraceful service by @British_Airways canceling our holiday, then, after we booked alternative flights, they have now emailed saying the original flight isn’t canceled after all!” said one user.
Some claimed to have waited hours on hold without getting through to a staff member.
In response to the CAA, British Airways said: “Our contact centers are operating 24/7 and we have brought in additional resources, with over 500 colleagues working to support customers during this time.
It added: ""Our teams are providing customers whose flights have been canceled with options to seek a full refund or rebook, including to a different date of travel, or flying with an alternative airline.”"

(Reuters) - J. M. Smucker Co (N:SJM) cut its full-year earnings forecast and reported disappointing quarterly results on Tuesday, as sales of its Nutrish dog food brand were hit by fierce competition, triggering a 10% drop in its shares.
Smucker has been betting on its pet food business by adding brands such as Milk Bone and celebrity chef Rachel Ray's Nutrish through the acquisition of Big Heart Pet Brands and Ainsworth Pet Nutrition.
However, Nutrish came under pressure as top dog food brands wrestled for market share in a red-hot premium pet food industry by rolling out products at competitive prices.
""We did not fully anticipate how aggressive some of the competition would be on pricing, particularly in trial-sized products,"" Chief Executive Officer Mark Smucker told Reuters. 
""We do believe that this pricing that we've seen in markets is at an unsustainable level. We will respond with pricing, in-store merchandising and advertising.""
Sales in its pet food unit, which also makes Meow Mix cat food, fell 7% in the first quarter from the previous quarter. The business is Smucker's biggest, accounting for more than a third of its sales.
The CEO said he expects softness in Nutrish's sales to continue in the second quarter and expects the dog food brand to grow in mid-to-high single digits for the rest of the year.
COFFEE BUSINESS COOLS
Sales of Smucker's coffee and peanut butter were also disappointing, as it lowered prices to boost demand. 
Packaged food companies are facing stiff competition from upstart brands, which are winning more shelf space in supermarkets across the United States as more consumers experiment with new flavors and ingredients.
Sales fell 5% in Smucker's coffee business and 17% in consumer foods business, which includes Jif peanut butter, from a year earlier.

""Argentina is our biggest export market, and it showed signs of recovery in the last two months but it is going to fall again from now on, that is clear,"" said Philipp Schiemer, president of Mercedes Benz for Brazil and Latin America.
The investment is part of a previously announced package that should total 2.4 billion reais ($582.6 million) until 2022.
Schiemer told reporters at the Mercedes Benz factory in Sao Bernardo do Campo, an industrial suburb of Sao Paulo, that exports for Brazil-made trucks and buses now account for less than 30% of its production, while at its peak it accounted for ""almost 50%.""
Brazil has not fully recovered from its worst recession in a century, which hit Latin America's largest economy in 2015. So far this year, Brazil has flirted with a new recession and the consensus of economic analysts is that GDP will grow under 1% in 2019.
""Brail today is poorer than it was in 2012, 2013,"" Schiemer said, speaking of the years when the domestic market was at its peak in terms of vehicle sales. While truck and bus sales are growing, they still significantly lag Brazil's peaks.
Mercedes Benz also said it had sold 500 trucks to beer maker Ambev SA (SA:ABEV3) and 1,600 buses to the city of Sao Paulo, both of which were record sales for the company.
It added that it will start a second shift in its bus production line in order to meet demand."

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - EU regulators are checking Google for Jobs to see if the company unfairly favors its fast-growing tool for searching job listings, Europe's antitrust chief said on Tuesday.
Launched two years ago, the tool has already drawn numerous complaints from rivals alleging anti-competitive behavior. 
Earlier this month, 23 job search websites in Europe urged the European Commission to temporarily order Google to stop such practices while it investigates the issue.
European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager, who has handed out 8.25 billion euros ($9.2 billion) in fines to the tech giant in recent years in three separate cases, voiced concerns about the possibility of similar anti-competitive practices by Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) unit Google in other areas.
""We're looking right now at whether the same thing may have happened with other parts of Google's business – like the job search business known as Google for Jobs,"" Vestager told a conference in Berlin.
Google said it had made changes to the tool following feedback in Europe, including offering direct links to a choice of job sites and linking directly to job offers available only on a single site.
Vestager said the European Commission may adopt rules to rein in tech giants if they do not play fair.
""There's also a broader issue for our societies, of whether we think it's right for companies like Google and others to have such control over the success or failure of other companies, and be free to use that power in any way they like,"" she said.

""If we don't, then we may find that we need regulation, to make sure that these platforms use their power in a way that's fair and doesn't discriminate,"" Vestager said.

Philip Morris International (NYSE:PM) and Altria (NYSE:MO) said on Tuesday they’re in talks to carry out an all-stock merger, a deal that would create a company worth more than $200 billion, 11 years after they split in an attempt to shield shareholders from potentially ruinous litigation in the U.S.
Altria's shares rose over 8% in early trading, while Philip Morris fell 5.5%, reflecting the fact that U.S.-focused Altria still trades at a hefty discount to its international half. At Monday’s closing levels, Altria was worth $80 billion, while PMI was worth $121 billion.
In a press release, the two companies styled the deal as “a merger of equals”, implying that shareholders of Altria could be set for a windfall. But they warned that a deal isn't certain: 
""There can be no assurance that any agreement or transaction will result from these discussions,"" the press release said. ""Additionally, there can be no assurance that if an agreement is reached, that a transaction will be completed.""
A deal would also need the approval of both companies’ boards and shareholders, and regulators. 
The move comes at a time when both companies are struggling with declining sales of their traditional product, cigarettes, and a profound change in habits among a new generation of more health-conscious consumers.
Altria in particular has tried to solve that strategic dilemma with investments in vaping company Juul Labs, in which it now owns a 35% stake, and a $1.8 billion investment in Canadian cannabis stock   Cronos   Group (NASDAQ:CRON).

(Reuters) - Wall Street's main indexes rose for the second straight session on Tuesday, supported by broad-based gains as investors pinned their hopes on a resolution to the protracted U.S.-China trade dispute despite mixed signals from both sides.
U.S. stocks closed up more than 1% on Monday after U.S. President Donald Trump sought to ease tensions by predicting another round of talks with Beijing. China's foreign ministry, however, reiterated on Tuesday that it had not received any recent telephone call from the United States on trade.

1241,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 27, 2019 09:14AM ET</span>",Someone Just Blew a Hole in the Volcker Rule,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Up to now, President Donald Trump’s largely ill-conceived effort to roll back financial regulation had one redeeming feature: a mostly sensible plan to improve the Volcker Rule, a piece of the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act aimed at limiting banks’ ability to take undue risks with taxpayer backing.
Not anymore. A new round of tweaks, which regulators are in the process of approving, threatens not to fix the rule, but to blow a big hole in it.
The impetus for the Volcker Rule arose from the bitter experience of the 2008 financial crisis. With the banking system on the verge of collapse, government officials faced a horrible choice: Let banks fail, with disastrous consequences for the economy, or rescue the system wholesale — including activities, such as speculative trading in securities and derivatives, that had little or nothing to do with providing credit to people and businesses.
The rule, as written in Dodd-Frank, aimed to prevent such a predicament from arising again, by forbidding federally insured banks from speculating through so-called proprietary trading. At the same time, though, the law allowed activities that can be hard to distinguish from speculation — such as market making, which involves buying and selling to satisfy customers’ needs. This posed a problem: How to tell the difference?
Regulators’ first attempt didn’t go well. Under their 2013 version of the rule, all positions held for less than 60 days were assumed to be speculative — unless banks could prove otherwise with metrics meant to show what traders were thinking. Supervisors struggled to make sense of this data, which different agencies interpreted differently. The result was a mess.
Last year, the Trump administration proposed a better approach. Instead of trying to get into traders’ heads, it focused on outcomes. Speculation tends to generate big gains and losses. So if traders stayed within certain limits, they would be presumed to be market making. If they didn’t, they would have to explain themselves. Although a lot would depend on where supervisors require banks to set the limits, bright lines would provide much-needed clarity.
Yet banks pushed back on one element of the new rule: It explicitly covered all the financial instruments that can be traded actively, as opposed to the subset that they designate as “trading” in their regulatory reports. The regulators gave way. They slipped in a provision narrowing the scope of the rule to “trading” positions. According to Martin Gruenberg, a director and former chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., this excludes about a quarter, or more than $600 billion, of the positions that the original rule covered.
Some say the change is no big deal. That’s hard to fathom. The positions in question can be speculative, even if banks don’t label them as “trading.” And they’re concentrated in the federally insured depositary subsidiaries of the largest U.S. bank holding companies.
Granted, the Volcker Rule isn’t the ideal way to stop subsidizing speculation. And to some extent, normal supervision and other regulations — such as capital requirements — help limit the risks that banks can take. But the narrowing of the rule’s scope will encourage speculation to migrate to places where regulators aren’t focused. As Gruenberg put it, this “opens up vast new opportunity … for speculative proprietary trading funded by the public safety net.”
What to do? Three regulators — the Federal Reserve, the Securities and Exchange Commission, and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission — have yet to approve the final rule. They shouldn’t. If they do, advocacy groups should consider challenging the rule in court, on the grounds that officials should have solicited public feedback on what amounts to a significant and previously unannounced change.
Weakening the Volcker Rule is ultimately in nobody’s interest. The spectacle of banks taking undue risks with taxpayer backing — and getting bailed out when they fail — has undermined public support for financial interventions that, at times, can be the only way to protect the economy. Why risk repeating the experience?

Next generation 5G technology, which can provide data speeds at least 20 times faster than 4G, will underpin the great advances of the next era, from self-driving cars and augmented reality to smart cities and artificial intelligence.

LONDON (Reuters) - Lloyds Banking Group (L:LLOY) is launching a specialist economic abuse support team with powers to help liberate thousands of vulnerable customers from financial oppression at the hands of their partners.
After campaigns to improve financial support for customers with cancer and mental ill health, Lloyds is look to people who suffer domestic abuse through the arbitrary control, exploitation or sabotage of household finances and debt.
Britain's biggest mortgage lender is training five staff members to provide a telephone hotline offering advice and guidance to at-risk customers, who will initially be referred to Lloyds by charity partners and victim refuges.
""One in four women and one in six men will be affected by domestic abuse in their lifetimes. When you think we have 25 million customers, and around 67,000 staff, the reason for us to address this is clear,"" Martin King, head of customer vulnerability at Lloyds, told Reuters.
According to a report published in June by Surviving Economic Abuse, one of the bank's charity partners, six in 10 domestic abuse survivors claim their partner had built up debt in their name, forced them to borrow money or make a purchase against their will.
The team, based in Newport, South Wales, will be trained to help customers who have been coerced into taking on personal loans or pressured into signing paperwork for joint debt such as mortgages.
The staff will also advise customers who are struggling financially because cards and documents necessary to access their money have been withheld by the dominant partner.
In the most acute cases, they will also provide critical assistance to customers who have fled abusive homes and who need to rebuild their lives from scratch.
To coincide with the launch of the telephone service, Lloyds is also changing its account terms and conditions to allow a party to be removed from a joint account where one of the account holders has been the victim of financial abuse.
The team will also have the ability to open up bank accounts without any identification or using a post office box address, under special circumstances.
The bank will also refer more complex financial abuse cases - typically where both parties are long-term Lloyds customers or hold a mortgage - to a specialist panel with powers to amend mortgage rates, divide and even cancel some problem debts.
Lloyds is hoping to have a pilot of the economic, financial and domestic abuse hotline up and running by September."
1246,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 27, 2019 08:11AM ET</span>",Pension World Reels From 'Financial Vandalism' of Falling Yields,"(Bloomberg) -- A once-unthinkable collapse in global bond yields is forcing pension funds to buy bonds that offer negative returns -- putting the financial security of future retirees in jeopardy.
U.S. institutions managing trillions of dollars in retirement savings -- including the California Public Employees’ Retirement System -- have been ratcheting down return expectations. Japan’s Government Pension Investment Fund, the world’s largest, has warned that money managers risk losses across asset classes. In Europe, pension funds may be forced to cut benefits in part thanks to the decline in rates.
Investors were already taking on more credit risk to make up for dwindling income elsewhere, with some chasing less liquid markets like private debt. Now, negative yields on over a quarter of investment-grade bonds -- with more monetary easing to come -- are increasing the urgency for portfolio managers to find new sources of returns.
“The true madness is pension funds being forced to invest in assets which will be guaranteed to lose, such as in the case of long dated inflation-linked gilts at real yields of -3%,” said Mark Dowding, chief investment officer at BlueBay Asset Management, which has pension-fund mandates. “It is financial vandalism and the government and central banks need to wake up to this.”
Pension funds invest in a variety of assets, but most including defined-benefit plans use low-risk assets such as government bonds as the benchmark discount rate. While that means they have profited from the fixed-income rally, falling yields have also driven up future liabilities -- in turn threatening their ability to meet oncoming obligations.
Ben Meng, chief investment officer of Calpers said earlier this year that the expected return over the next 10 years would be 6.1%, down from a previous target of 7%. Scott Minerd, chief investment officer of Guggenheim Partners, warns that the Federal Reserve’s policy easing is contributing to a likely government-bond bubble and that very narrow credit spreads have greater potential to widen.
Ten-year yields are negative across higher-rated European government bond markets while Germany’s entire curve fell below zero. Similar rates are also sub-zero in Japan, while they’ve recently hit record lows in Australia and New Zealand. In the U.S., 30-year Treasury rates hit an all-time low of 1.91% this month.
‘Dire’ Situation
Peter Borgdorff at Dutch fund PFZW blamed “that ever-lower interest rate” for its coverage ratio that stood at 94.8% at the end of July.
“The financial situation of PFZW is starting to get dire,” Borgdorff wrote in his blog. “A pension reduction in the year 2021 has been threatening for some time. But if we have a coverage ratio at the end of this year that is lower than around 94%, we should already reduce pensions even next year.”
The plunge in yields risks spawning a vicious circle for the industry. The squeeze on returns tends to widen funding gaps, forcing managers or employers to inject more cash into the plans. That’s money which could have otherwise been used to fuel business or consumption so economic growth may take a hit -- boosting calls for even more monetary easing.
Shrinking Assets
“The overall impact is that lower yields can induce households or companies that act as plan sponsors, to save even more for the future,” said Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, a strategist at JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co, in a recent note. “In our conversations with clients, the experiments of central banks with negative rates are viewed more as a policy mistake rather than stimulus.”
Pension assets dropped 4% in 2018 to $27.6 trillion, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. While gains on stocks have helped plug funding gaps, it’s no secret that income-starved managers have dived into less liquid assets.
Cases are legion. One of the Nordic region’s largest pension funds is reducing its stock of government bonds for alternative assets, which could include real estate and private equity. A scheme for the retired clergy in England is shifting allocations to private credit. A fund for U.K. railworkers, meanwhile, is looking to boost exposure to private debt to as much as 40% within a private-investment strategy totaling 4.5 billion pounds ($5.5 billion) across two funds.
Chris Iggo, chief investment officer for fixed income at AXA Investment Managers, frets over the fallout from this extended era of ultra-low yields.
“In 2008, most people in the markets had no idea about the leveraged web of instruments that were ultimately linked to the housing market in the U.S.,” he wrote in a note, referring to the subprime debt crisis. “We should be worried about lower and lower bond yields...They may cause some, as yet not fully understood, tensions in the financial system with structural implications.”"

KAMPALA (Reuters) - Uganda on Tuesday relaunched its national carrier, Uganda Airlines, hoping to take a slice of the East African aviation business that is dominated by Ethiopian Airlines (UL:ETHA)
The country is banking on its emerging oil industry and the traditional tourism sector to generate international traffic to sustain the airline.
Though air traffic in Africa is forecast to grow 6% a year, twice as quickly as mature markets, over the next two decades, most state-owned flag carriers on the continent are losing money. The notable exception is Ethiopian Airlines, which analysts say has avoided the mistakes of other regional carriers and not fallen prey to political interference.
""We undertake to be a world class airline that will exceed customer expectations through high quality service,"" Ugandan Airlines CEO Ephraim Bagenda said at a ceremony at Entebbe, the country's sole international airport, south of the capital Kampala.
The airline will initially fly to seven regional destinations in Kenya, Tanzania, Somalia, South Sudan, and Burundi, the CEO said ahead of the inaugural flight to Kenya's capital Nairobi.
In November, the airline would launch flights to destinations in south and central Africa, he said.
But Uganda Airlines will face stiff competition not only from Ethiopian Airlines, but also from Rwanda and Tanzania which have also poured cash into their flag carriers in the past few years, though with far less success than Ethiopia. Another rival regional carrier Kenya Airways (NR:KQNA) has also faced challenges in its efforts to expand. It became loss-making in 2014 after buying a number of aircraft which coincided with a slump in tourist and business travel to Kenya blamed on a spate of attacks by Somalia-based Islamist militants.
The airline has not recovered and was renationalized in July in what analysts said was a last-ditch effort to save it.
Uganda Airlines, founded by the country's former dictator Idi Amin in 1976, was liquidated in 2001 during a push to privatize state firms.
Its revival will ""reduce the cost of air transport and ease connectivity to and from Uganda,"" Prime Minister Ruhakana Rugunda said at the ceremony.
Ugandans spend about $450 million annually on foreign travel and the state-owned airline would help keep some of this cash within the national economy, Rugunda said.
Citizens would also benefit from direct flights from their capital over expensive, indirect routes on rival airlines, the prime minister said.
The airline received its first two CRJ900 planes from Canadian aircraft manufacturer Bombardier (TO:BBDb) in April. Two more of those planes are expected next month, according to the airline.
It expects to receive an Airbus (PA:AIR) A330 Neo in late 2020, then a second in early 2021, the CEO told Reuters in July, adding that the two wide-body planes will enable the airline to expand to destinations in the Gulf and China.
Each Bombardier cost around $27 million while the carrier will pay about $110 million for each of the Airbus aircrafts.
The airline is wholly publicly funded and forecasts that it will be self-financing after two years, the CEO told Reuters in July."

OSLO (Reuters) - Norway's $1 trillion sovereign wealth fund should shift billions in investments from European stock markets and instead invest more in the United States and other North American markets to seek higher returns, the fund's manager recommended on Tuesday.
The world's largest sovereign wealth fund has historically given higher weighting to European stocks, focusing on countries that Norway does the most trade with, and a lower weighting to those of North America. 
But the Norwegian central bank, which manages the Government Pension Fund Global, said this was no longer necessary, and it wanted the fund's portfolio to better reflect the available pool of investments.
""We can all see that both return and the common measure of risk has been better in North America in the past years than it has been in the rest of the world,"" Egil Matsen, the deputy central bank governor in charge of the fund, told Reuters.
He declined to say how much of the value of the fund could potentially shift further to North American equities. 
""We are not specific on that, and that is a conscious decision,"" he said, stressing that it would be up to the finance ministry, and parliament, to decide whether to take up the central bank's advice. 
If they do, it would mean potentially billions of euros, pounds and other European currencies of investments would shift from Europe to the United States and other North American markets. 
As it stands, Norway's rainy day fund, which invests the proceeds of the country's oil and gas production, owns more European stocks and fewer U.S. shares than the size of those markets would dictate
But the fund eased the policy of directing investment to Norway's most important trading partners in 2012, the last time it reviewed its regional weighting.
The fund has since reduced its exposure to European shares from 50% of the total equity holdings to about 34% by the end of 2018. Some 43.0% of the fund's investments were in North America at the end of last year and 17% in Asia.
The advice is not based on any particular view on future return in individual markets or regions, the fund added. 
The finance ministry said separately that it would give its assessment next spring. ""Implementation of any changes in the benchmark index will be gradually over time,"" it said.

Videos posted on Chinese social media showed thousands of people crowding the aisles of the store in Shanghai's Minhang district, while signs outside warned incoming shoppers that they might have to wait three hours to park.
One nearby school sent out an advisory to parents warning them about the traffic conditions. ""Please expect the student dismissal this afternoon to be severely delayed due to the grand opening of Costco Supermarket,"" said the message.
The Paper, a media outlet run by the Shanghai government, reported on social media at 2:43 p.m. (0622 GMT) that the store had shut early, citing the local district government.
""Due to the extremely large crowds at the newly opened supermarket, for the safety of the public we urge that residents consume in a rational manner and choose to go shopping at an off-peak time,"" it quoted government officials as saying.
Costco did not immediately respond to a Reuters' request for comment.
Costco announced last month that it would open its first store in China. It first entered the country in 2014 through opening an online store on  Alibaba  Group Holding Ltd's (N:BABA) Tmall online marketplace.

Its busy first day came as other big-name Western retailers such as Amazon (O:AMZN),  Tesco  Plc (L:TSCO) and  Carrefour  (PA:CARR), are retreating from China having struggled to win market share in the face of strong competition from domestic rivals.

The 26-floor building has 400,000 square feet and an occupancy rate of 87%. A significant portion of the building is leased to an international accounting firm, and the remaining areas are mainly leased to technology companies, law firms, accounting firms and service providers.
This is Harel's third office building investment in San Francisco, with the two additional buildings also located in the city's central business district.
Harel is joined in the transaction by a publicly traded U.S. real estate investment trust, with an enterprise value of over $8 billion. Harel did not name the REIT but said the parties have made several joint transactions in the past.
Real estate is a growing investment channel for Harel, as it seeks investments with relatively stable, realistic returns not directly linked to capital market indices, it said."

LONDON (Reuters) - World shares gained on Tuesday as some investors held out hopes for a trade deal between the United States and China, even though they continued to raise tariffs on each other last week.
Shares in Asia gained followed U.S. stocks higher on Monday, after U.S. President Donald Trump predicted a trade deal with China. European shares recovered to trader higher after opening lower.
Automakers and Italian stocks boosted the pan-European STOXX index, which was up 0.3% by midday in London. 
Germany's DAX rose 0.4% and France's CAC 40 gained 0.2%. Italy's FTSE MIB rose over 1% on hopes the country's ruling 5-Star Movement and the opposition Democratic Party would make a deal to form a new Italian government. 
MSCI'S All Country World Index, which tracks shares across 47 countries, was up 0.16% on the day.
Wall Street futures last traded flat.
Trump said on Monday that Chinese officials had contacted their U.S. trade counterparts and offered to resume negotiations, an assertion that China declined to confirm. The comments helped temper losses in global markets after both sides announced new tariffs on Friday. 
""Some of the moves we have seen in the summer are exaggerated because of investors being away,"" said Ugo Lancioni, managing director of global fixed income and currency management at Neuberger Berman. 
""Though we are lightly positioned on risk in our portfolios given the `deal or no deal' situation, whether it is the trade war, Brexit or Italy, we are wary of a snap-back rally in the markets.""
Lancioni added that investors have been looking for safe assets such as gold, the Japanese yen and the Swiss franc in recent months, so some of those assets may be overvalued.
The Japanese yen, which rallies when markets turn risk averse, was up 0.3% to the dollar. 
Gold, another safe haven, was 0.3% higher at $1,529.86 per ounce and just off its gains the day before, which reached its highest in more than six years. [GOL/]
In Asia, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was up 0.35% after dropping 1.3% the previous day. Japan's Nikkei rose 1%.
The Shanghai Composite Index rallied 1.35%, with a boost from data showing China's industrial companies returned to profit in July.
South Korea's KOSPI added 0.4%.
Markets have been quick to rally on any encouraging signs from trade negotiations between the U.S. and China. However, tariffs have only escalated between the two countries since 2018, creating uncertainty and curbing growth.
""Although the continued resilience of consumers keeps us confident in the global economic outlook, we do not see this as the best environment for taking risk on stocks,"" said Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management.
""As a result, we make three changes to our tactical asset allocation. We remove our overweight to global equities versus high grade bonds and initiate an underweight to emerging market stocks versus high grade bonds. Separately, we also adjust our overweight to select higher yielding emerging market currencies.""
The dollar index versus a basket of six major currencies stood at 97.91, falling 0.2%. The euro was 0.1% higher at $1.1109 after losing 0.4% on Monday.

Oil prices rose. Brent crude futures were up 1.14% at $59.38 per barrel after losing 1% the previous day. U.S. crude rose 1.32% to $54.35 per barrel.

The Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 operated by the European Union airline was flying from Greece's Samos island to the Czech capital Prague on Aug. 22 when its left engine stopped over the Aegean Sea.
The plane continued to Prague rather than landing at a closer airport.
""We are shocked, it is unprecedented in our view in terms of the crew behaviour, according to the information available so far,"" said Vitezslav Hezky, spokesman for the Czech Aviation Authority (CAA).
A plane with an engine malfunction is supposed to land at the nearest suitable airport in accordance with instructions from Boeing, CAA said in a statement released on its website.
It said it would make ""all effort to avoid the recurrence of a similar scenario.""
Smartwings said at the weekend that the crew had the flight under control and that they followed safety procedures.
An airline spokeswoman said on Tuesday the company was conducting an internal investigation into the flight and the crew response in line with regulations, and was ready to cooperate with the CAA.
Smartwings, which operates its own fleet and has also taken over the national carrier Czech Airlines, reported a profit of 81.3 million crowns ($3.51 million) in 2018.
It has faced losses from the grounding of the Boeing 737-800 MAX planes which make up part of its fleet.
Another Smartwings airplane was forced to make an emergency landing shortly after takeoff from Budapest on July 11 after its landing gear was damaged."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc (N:BLK) is stepping up opposition to U.S. CEOs who sit on more than one corporate board beside their own, arguing that working as a director takes increasingly more time, a report from the world's largest asset manager showed on Tuesday.
BlackRock cast votes against 94 chief executives running for re-election to corporate boards outside of their own in this year's proxy season, up from 32 last year, according to the report.
The uptick reflects BlackRock's concerns about CEOs over-extending themselves. It also represents a shift in its actions. Under its previous guidelines, the asset manager had considered two external director positions beyond the CEO's own board as manageable. This is the first year the company is more strictly enforcing its new policy by voting against CEOs.
""It sounds fine to sit on multiple boards, but what happens when something goes wrong at a company?"" BlackRock Vice Chairman Barbara Novick said in an interview. ""More and more companies are limiting how many outside boards their CEOs can sit on.""
With $6.8 trillion in assets under management, BlackRock is an influential force in how boards of directors operate, and can swing votes in important corporate elections.
BlackRock also voted this proxy season against directors at 52 companies included in the Russell 1000 index (RUI), because their boards had fewer than two women or no other directors of diverse ethnicity, age or certain other personal characteristics, according to the report. The asset manager says that diverse groups make better decisions.
More than 45 people now work on BlackRock's investment stewardship team around the world that is focused on holding corporate boards accountable to high governance standards, up from 16 a decade ago."

""As in the past, Deutsche Boerse is fully cooperating with the authorities,"" the spokesman said.
Handelsblatt first reported the raids, adding that Clearstream apparently played a key role in the illegal dealings.

The investigation into the scheme began as far back as 2013. Prosecutors have said the practice misled the German government into paying tax refunds that have cost the country billions of euros."

With liquidity taps open and policy rates stuck in a “black hole” they haven’t managed to escape, “we should stop worrying about central bank stimulus,” Jerome Haegeli, Swiss Re’s chief economist, said Tuesday in an interview in Singapore. Rather, he said, policy makers should focus on strengthening an economy’s “resilience” -- the ability to withstand future shocks.
That would require structural reforms and regulatory changes to help private-sector capital support growth, Haegeli said. Massive global debt piles, a proliferation of negative yields and low growth trend are undermining such resilience, he said.
Markets seem to be the big winners in the decade since the financial crisis. While the global economy has grown at less than half the pace of a typical recovery, the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index -- which Haegeli said usually multiplies returns by 1.7 in the decade after a trough -- has seen returns rise four-fold since 2009.
“Everybody believes inflation is dead,” Haegeli said. “It’s not. We have asset-price inflation.”
Here’s more from the interview:
He sees a 35% chance of a U.S. recession. While the Federal Reserve generally has shown prudence in this cycle, the type of “insurance cuts” it undertook in July are ill-advisedThe response to the next global recession will likely require a “marriage” of fiscal and central bank policy“I’m more concerned about central banks being hostage to financial markets” than any political pressures they might be responding to"

After August’s sell-off, the time to buy stocks is approaching, strategists led by Mislav Matejka wrote in a note Tuesday, saying equities will move higher starting with an up trend in September. Benchmarks including the S&P 500 Index, the Stoxx Europe 600 Index and the MSCI Asia Pacific Index are poised for their biggest monthly declines since May.
“While we have been advocating a consolidation call during August, we continue to expect that the pullback will not extend for longer than the May one did, and still believe that the market will advance into year-end,” the JPMorgan strategists wrote.
An escalation in the trade war between the U.S. and China this month has stoked investor concern about the outlook for the global economy, hurting equities worldwide. Major asset managers including Legal & General and Manulife Investment Management have taken profit on their risk assets and entered a wait-and-see mode.
JPMorgan sees a string of positive catalysts that could lift equities out of the doldrums, such as the restart of the European Central Bank’s quantitative easing program, the potential for a second and bigger rate cut by the Federal Reserve, along with signs that activity may have bottomed out and improving technical indicators.
The New York-based firm’s bullish outlook clashes with that of UBS Global Wealth Management, which has gone underweight on equities for the fist time since the euro-area crisis. The Swiss asset manager cut its stock positioning relative to high-grade bonds to reduce its exposure to trade wars and political uncertainty, Global Chief Investment Officer Mark Haefele wrote in an Aug. 25 note to investors.
Positive earnings delivery, JPMorgan stresses, is a key way to ensure that market pullbacks don’t become extended. Consensus profit projections are “rather conservative,” according to the strategists, who noted that an outright earnings contraction was historically experienced only during recessions.
“It is too early to expect the next U.S. recession and one should be constructive on equities,” they wrote."

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian state lender Promsvyazbank (PSB) has stepped up gold purchases in the market, Deputy Finance Minister Alexei Moiseev said on Tuesday.
His comments follow reports by Russia's business daily Kommersant which cited a PSB earnings report last week that the bank's precious metals purchases jumped to 23.9 billion roubles ($362.15 million) from 0.8 billion roubles in the first half of the year.
Based on the central bank's gold purchase prices, the precious metals purchases were the equivalent of more than 8 tonnes of gold, the paper said.
The PSB report, however, was later deleted and the bank republished it without the precious metals report.
Asked about the jump in the precious metals purchases, Moiseev confirmed Kommersant's report that PSB was buying gold but did not comment on specific figures cited by the paper.
""The jump is due to the fact that the bank is looking for niche markets and has started operating in the gold market,"" Moiseev told reporters.
The most active players on the Russian gold markets among the banks are the state-controlled Sberbank (MM:SBER) and VTB (MM:VTBR), who both have special trader teams for conducting such operations.
Moiseev did not specify how PSB was buying gold or why. PSB officials were not immediately available for comment.
Asked why the PSB report which initially showed a jump in the precious metals purchases was adjusted, he said: ""Gold matters are not completely transparent and open, this is why we decided to do so.""
In 2017, the Russian central bank took over PSB, once among Russia's biggest private banks, and turned it into a lender for the country's defense sector.
The move was aimed to shield Sberbank and VTB from potential new U.S. sanctions. The government has also freed PSB from the obligation to disclose financial results and board of director members.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - A unit of Russian conglomerate Rostec said on Tuesday it was ready for an out-of-court settlement with Boeing (N:BA) over its order for 35 Boeing (N:BA) 737 MAX jets, a spokesman for Rostec's subsidiary Avia Capital Service told Reuters.
Boeing MAX 737 jets have been grounded worldwide and airlines are cancelling multimillion contracts following crashes in October and March that killed 346 people.
Earlier on Tuesday, Rostec said its unit had filed a lawsuit in the United States to cancel its order for the 35 MAX jets. The Financial Times, which first reported the move, said Avia Capital Service gave Boeing a cash deposit of $35 million.
A spokesman for Avia Capital Service told Reuters that delivery of the jets was first scheduled for October 2019 but was moved to March 2022. The Rostec unit had paid Boeing a deposit and was suffering losses from non-delivery, he said.
""If Boeing executives show a good will, we are ready to hold talks and find a mutually-beneficial out-of-court settlement for compensation of the losses we have suffered,"" he said.
He added that the jets were ordered for a number of Russian air companies, including domestic low-cost firm Pobeda, a unit of the state carrier Aeroflot (MM:AFLT).
Russia is mainly using Boeing and Airbus (PA:AIR) jets for passenger flights, with a number of domestic airlines also adding Russian-made regional Sukhoi Superjet aircraft to their fleets.
The Rostec subsidiary now wants the deposit to be returned by Boeing with interest, along with $75 million in ""lost profit"" and about $115 million in compensatory damages, plus ""several times the amount"" in punitive damages, the FT said.
Rostec declined to provide further details about the lawsuit."

Investing.com -- Italy’s stock market was again the star performer in Europe on Tuesday as the country’s political parties edged closer to a deal that would end the threat of a direct confrontation with the EU over its budget deficit, at least in the short term.
The 5 Stars Movement and center-left Democratic Party have until Wednesday to decide whether or not to form a new government and banish the risk of snap elections later this year. That would most likely lead to them presenting a budget for 2020 acceptable to the European Commission and its partners in the euro zone.
However, it would also keep Italy in the budgetary straitjacket that has contributed to the rise of populism in the country, and would still leave it without a clear path to reviving growth.

NORMAN, Okla./BOSTON (Reuters) - An Oklahoma judge on Monday ordered Johnson & Johnson (N:JNJ) to pay $572.1 million to the state for its part in fueling an opioid epidemic by deceptively marketing addictive painkillers, a sum that was substantially less than investors had expected, driving up J&J's shares.
The state's attorney general had filed the lawsuit, seeking $17 billion to address the impact of the drug crisis on Oklahoma. It had been considered a bellwether for other litigation nationwide over the opioid epidemic. 
""The expectation was this was going to be a $1.5 billion to $2 billion fine,"" said Jared Holz, healthcare strategist for Jefferies & Co. ""$572 million is a much lower number than had been feared.""
J&J said it would appeal the decision.
Shares of J&J were up 2% in extended trading following the decision, after an initial gain of more than 5%. Other drugmakers that sell opioid painkillers and are defending against similar lawsuits also rose after-hours, including Teva Pharmaceutical (NYSE:TEVA) Industries Ltd (TA:TEVA) up 2.6%, and Endo International Plc (O:ENDP), up 1.4% higher.
Opioids were involved in almost 400,000 overdose deaths from 1999 to 2017, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Since 2000, some 6,000 Oklahomans have died from opioid overdoses, according to the state's lawyers.
Roughly 2,500 lawsuits have been brought by states, counties and municipalities nationally seeking to hold drugmakers responsible for opioid abuse nationwide. Oklahoma's case was the first to go to trial. Some drugmakers have chosen to settle cases.
In holding J&J liable after a seven-week, non-jury trial, Judge Thad Balkman of Cleveland County District Court in Norman, Oklahoma, said the state proved that J&J's misleading marketing and promotion of its Duragesic and Nucynta painkillers created a public nuisance.
""The opioid crisis is an imminent danger and menace to Oklahomans,"" Balkman said.
Oklahoma wanted J&J to help it address the epidemic for the next 30 years by funding addiction treatment and prevention programs.
Balkman said in his written ruling that the award covered only one year of addressing the crisis because Oklahoma did not demonstrate the time and costs needed beyond that.
Lance Lang, a 36-year-old recovering user of opioids turned activist in Oklahoma City, said it was “short sighted” for the judge to have only ordered funding for a year. “There’s going to be people struggling with this for years,” he said in an interview.
J&J said it will ask that the award be put on hold during an appeal process that could stretch into 2021. The company also said Oklahoma failed to show that its products and activities had created a public nuisance.
""You can't sue your way out of the opioid abuse crisis,"" Sabrina Strong, a lawyer for J&J, said at a news conference after the verdict. ""Everyone must come together to address this. But J&J did not cause the opioid crisis.""
""ACCOUNTABLE FOR DEATHS AND ADDICTIONS""
The case was brought by Oklahoma Attorney General Mike Hunter, who alleged that J&J's marketing practices helped fuel the opioid epidemic by flooding the market with painkillers.
""Johnson & Johnson will finally be held accountable for thousands of deaths and addictions caused by their actions,"" Hunter said.
The trial came after Oklahoma had resolved claims against OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma LP in March for $270 million and Teva in May for $85 million, leaving J&J as the lone defendant.
The verdict came as two Ohio counties prepare for a scheduled October trial before a federal judge in Cleveland. About 2,000 lawsuits out of some 2,500 filed nationwide are consolidated in the case in Cleveland.
Endo International Plc (O:ENDP) and Allergan Plc (N:AGN) last week agreed to pay $15 million to avoid going to trial in October in a case by two Ohio counties, subject to court approval.
Some plaintiffs' lawyers have compared the opioid cases to litigation by states against the tobacco industry that led to a $246 billion settlement in 1998.
Joe Rice, a lead plaintiff's attorney for municipalities in the federal litigation, said if the Oklahoma award were extrapolated to other states, it could mean an annual abatement cost of around $38 billion. 
“It does indicate that if I’m in the pharmaceutical business, I’ve got to think long and hard about annual payments of my share of that,” he said.
The judge overseeing the federal litigation in Ohio has been pushing for a global settlement.
J&J, which is among multiple pharmaceutical companies that are defendants in the federal litigation, said it remains ""open to viable options"" to resolve the Ohio case, including through settlement.
During the Oklahoma trial, lawyers for the state argued that J&J carried out a years-long marketing campaign that minimized the painkillers' addiction risks and promoted their benefits.
The lawyers called J&J an opioid ""kingpin"" and argued that its marketing created a public nuisance as doctors over-prescribed the drugs, leading to a surge in overdose deaths.
J&J countered that its marketing claims had scientific support and its painkillers accounted for a tiny fraction of opioids prescribed in Oklahoma. The company said in a statement that since 2008, its painkillers accounted for less than 1% of the U.S. market, including generics.
Teva said the ruling supported its rationale for settling the case before trial, and said it was preparing to defend itself in the upcoming trial in Ohio.

Purdue, which is also among the defendants in the Ohio litigation, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Contract chipmaker GlobalFoundries sued larger rival and Apple supplier TSMC for patent infringement, seeking to stop imports into the United States and Germany of products made with the allegedly infringed technologies. 
In lawsuits filed on Monday in the United States and Germany, GlobalFoundries also sought unspecified ""significant"" damages from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC) (TW:2330) based on the Taiwanese firm's unlawful use of its technology in its ""tens of billions of dollars of sales"".
The complaints alleged that chip manufacturing technologies used by TSMC infringed GlobalFoundries' 16 patents, and sought to prevent imports of customers' products containing chips produced with the infringing technologies, the Santa Clara, California-based firm said in a statement.
It did not elaborate on products affected by the alleged infringement, but listed Apple Inc (O:AAPL),  Qualcomm Inc  (O:QCOM), Alphabet Inc's (O:GOOGL) Google,  Nvidia Corp  (O:NVDA), Lenovo Group (HK:0922) and Taiwan' MediaTek Inc (TW:2454) among TSMC's customers affected by the complaints.
TSMC called the allegations ""baseless"".
""We are disappointed to see a foundry peer resort to meritless lawsuits instead of competing in the marketplace with technology,"" it said in a statement.
It added that it would ""fight vigorously, using any and all
options"" to protect its proprietary technologies.
Nvidia declined to comment. TSMC's other clients were not immediately available for comment.
In a move to highlight its investment in the United States amid an intensifying U.S. trade war with China over Beijing's alleged unfair practices involving technology transfers and intellectual property, GlobalFoundries also said the lawsuits are aimed at protecting its U.S. investment.
""While semiconductor manufacturing has continued to shift to Asia, GlobalFoundries has bucked the trend by investing heavily in the American and European semiconductor industries,"" GlobalFoundries, which is owned by Abu Dhabi's state investment vehicle, said.

""This action is critical ... to safeguard the American and European manufacturing base.""

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - President Donald Trump's aggressive stance and often mixed signals in his trade war with China are taking a toll on the shares of U.S. companies that are most reliant on the world's second largest economy.
U.S. stocks rose more than 1% on Monday after Trump predicted a U.S.-China trade deal following remarks by Vice Premier Liu He, who has been leading the talks with Washington, that China was willing to resolve their dispute through ""calm"" negotiations.
On Friday, the S&P 500 tumbled 2.6% after Trump announced an additional duty on some $550 billion of Chinese goods in retaliation for Beijing's announcement of more tariffs of its own earlier in the day. Trump also sent a tweet demanding U.S. companies seek alternatives to doing business with China, but appeared to back off the threat on Sunday.
Escalating uncertainty related to Trump's intentions regarding the year-old trade conflict is adding to pain on Wall Street, where investors are worried that tariffs could tip the U.S. economy into a recession.

""This trade war is having more plot twists than a Quentin Tarantino movie,"" OANDA senior market analyst Edward Moya wrote in a research note. He added that higher and wider tariffs will punish U.S. consumers and potentially hobble the U.S. economy.

A basket of companies impacted by the trade war, created by  Barclays  (LON:BARC), has sharply underperformed the S&P 500 this month after tracking evenly with the broader market for the three previous months. Barclays' basket includes companies that rely heavily on Chinese imports and are likely to face profit-margin pressure from tariffs, such as Apple (O:AAPL),  Nike  (N:NKE) and Honeywell International (N:HON).

U.S. semiconductor stocks have also underperformed this month. Micron Technology (O:MU), Qualcomm (O:QCOM) and Qorvo (O:QRVO) each get 50% or more of their revenue from China. Consumer electronics and other products made with semiconductors will be included in additional U.S. tariffs, starting on Sept. 1 and Dec. 15, the U.S. government said this month. The Philadelphia Semiconductor index has lost almost 6% in August.

Trump's widening trade war and China's slowing economic expansion have hurt several other U.S. industrial and material companies that in recent years have relied on China to drive their growth.
Detroit automakers General Motors Co (N:GM) and  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) cut their full-year profit forecasts due to escalating tariffs.  Caterpillar  Inc (N:CAT) recently said tariffs on Chinese imports are expected to increase its material costs by up to $200 million in the second half of 2019.

Lynch, the president of Arby's Restaurant Group Inc, will succeed Ritchie, and the management change will be made as early as Tuesday, the report said, citing a person with knowledge of the matter. 
The development comes amid Papa John's struggle due to steep competition and slowing sales, while the pizza chain also reported a 12% decline in 2018 revenue. 
Ritchie took over as chief executive last year after company founder John Schnatter came under fire for criticizing the National Football League's leadership over national anthem protests by players.
Schnatter stepped down from the company's board earlier this year, as part of a settlement resolving a bitter dispute for control of the world's third-largest pizza chain.
The negative publicity, which dented the pizza chain's sales last year, led the Louisville, Kentucky-based company to name former basketball star Shaquille O'Neal as a board member, brand ambassador and investor. 
Activist investment firm Starboard Value LP had pushed for a change at Papa John's in the first quarter.

Both banks face charges relating to allegations that their traders used confidential customer information to gain potential advantage in foreign exchange transactions that took place between 2011 and 2013, the regulator said.
The hearing will be held on Friday at the commission's office in Toronto.
The banks are accused of failing to have sufficient controls in their FX trading business during the three-year period, according to two separate 'statements of allegations' from the Ontario Securities Commission.
The regulator also said the banks' lack of sufficient controls allowed inappropriate sharing of confidential client information by their respective FX traders with traders at other competitor firms.

SAO PAULO/RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Brazil's planned privatization of eight Petroleo Brasileiro SA (SA:PETR4) refineries has lured several of the world's largest trading and oil companies as prospective bidders, two sources with knowledge of the matter said.
Around 20 companies have signed non-disclosure agreements granting them access to the refineries' data and signaling that they are considering a bid, the sources added, speaking on condition of anonymity to disclose private details of the sale.
The first round of non-binding offers for four of the eight refineries Petrobras put on the block is due on Oct. 11, the sources said. The eight refineries have total capacity of 1.1 million barrels per day.
Among the potential bidders are trading firms Vitol SA,  Glencore  PLC (L:GLEN) and Trafigura AG. Local companies Ultrapar Participações SA (SA:UGPA3) and Raizen, a joint venture of Brazil's Cosan SA (SA:CSAN3) and Royal Dutch Shell (L:RDSa), also signed non-disclosure agreements.
Other companies interested, according to the sources, include PetroChina Co (SS:601857) and Sinopec (SS:600688), which already has a Brazilian joint venture with Spain's Repsol (MC:REP). Oil behemoth Saudi Aramco, which is planning one of the world's largest initial public offerings, is also looking at the refining units' numbers.
The request to access the data room is just the first step of companies interested in the deal, and does not mean they will deliver bids on Oct. 11.
Petrobras, PetroChina, Ultrapar, Sinopec and Vitol did not immediately comment on the matter. Raizen, Trafigura, Saudi Aramco and Glencore declined to comment.
TRANSFORMATIVE DEALS
The deal, to be one of Petrobras' largest divestitures ever, would transform Brazil's oil industry and may raise around $18 billion, bankers working on the deal say. Refining has traditionally been state-owned in Brazil, triggering occasional calls for government price controls.
At least partial privatization is widely seen as one of the best possible ways to bring real competition to the Brazilian oil industry.
Antitrust watchdog CADE has already forced Petrobras to change its refinery sale process to boost competition, demanding the separate sale of each of the eight refineries. A single buyer will be barred from buying two of the largest refineries in the same area, whether it be the northeast, the south or the southeast.
Petrobras is also carving out logistics assets, such as oil pipelines and terminals, to sell along with the refineries, one of the sources said.
Most of the bidding groups are expected to include private pipeline operators, possibly including France's Engie (PA:ENGIE) and Canada's Brookfield (TO:BAMa), one of the sources said, explaining that oil companies are reaching out to them. Both companies recently acquired Petrobras assets."

The instruments would give creditors the rights to receive proceeds of the asset sales and future profits of the companies controlled by the conglomerate. 
The plan, which the statement said Odebrecht filed with the court late on Monday, has no explicit discount on the 51 billion reais ($12.4 billion) debt that is being restructured. But it is unclear how much creditors could receive of the debt or within what time frame they could receive even a fraction of the debt.
Creditors will be able to receive proceeds of sales of assets owned by the conglomerate or one of its 21 subsidiaries that filed for bankruptcy, which include companies that own power as well as infrastructure assets and real estate.
Creditors could also receive potential future profits of the companies. As the conglomerate has no recurring revenue, the instruments similar to equity were the only solution devised by the restructuring advisors, two people with knowledge of the matter said.

1273,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 26, 2019 08:32PM ET</span>","Ferdinand Piech, architect of VW's global expansion, dies aged 82: Bild","By Edward Taylor
FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Ferdinand Piech, Volkswagen AG's (DE:VOWG_p) former chairman and chief executive, who transformed the German company from a struggling midsized carmaker into a global automotive powerhouse, has died, German tabloid Bild said on Monday.
Piech, 82, died on Sunday in Rosenheim, Bavaria, the German tabloid said, without citing sources. 
A representative for the Piech and  Porsche  families, who still control a majority stake in Volkswagen through their family holding company Porsche SE, had no immediate comment.
Volkswagen could not be reached for comment.
Piech was a grandson of Ferdinand Porsche, the father of the iconic Volkswagen Beetle. 
A brilliant engineer, Piech turned around VW after betting on a modular construction technique which allowed Audi, Skoda and VW brands to share up to 65% common parts, helping Volkswagen Group to attain greater economies of scale. 
Under Piech's leadership, VW emphasized engineering brilliance ahead of profits, and went on an expansion spree, adding high-margin luxury marques Bentley, Bugatti and Lamborghini in a single year.
""First and foremost I always saw myself as a product person, and relied on gut instinct for market demand. Business and politics never distracted me from the core of our mission: to develop and make attractive cars,"" Piech wrote in his autobiography.
While working as a 31-year-old development chief at Porsche in 1968, he invested two thirds of Porsche's annual racing budget to build 25 Porsche 917 race cars with an untested radical 600 horsepower air-cooled 12-cylinder engine design.
Family members accused Piech of being an irresponsible manager after risking the company's budget, but the Porsche 917 went on to become one of the most successful race cars in history, cementing his status as a visionary engineer. 
During his nine-year tenure as CEO, Piech turned a loss equivalent of 1 billion euros into a 2.6 billion euro profit while spearheading VW's' expansion into a 12-brand empire which includes the Seat, Skoda, Bentley, Audi, Porsche and Ducati brands in addition to the MAN and Scania truck brands.
Piech was known for his ability to outmaneuver competitors by stoking internal rivalries to his own advantage, even if it resulted in backing labor leaders to the detriment of his own managers including Bernd Pischetsrieder and Wolfgang Bernhard.
Some of Piech's top lieutenants were prosecuted for securing support for radical restructuring plans by sponsoring lavish business trips for labor leaders, including sex with prostitutes. 
""It is not possible to take a company to the top by focusing on the highest level of harmony,"" Piech said in his book.
WINNER TAKES ALL
Governance at Porsche and VW was for decades marked by encouraging a winner-takes-all culture which was later blamed for causing VW managers to lie about illegal emissions, rather than admitting that their cars could not meet clean air rules.
The scandal, which Piech was not associated with, has cost Volkswagen more than 30 billion euros in lawsuits and fines. 
Piech became Volkswagen's chief executive in 1993 and chairman in 2002, reviving the VW brand by introducing sophisticated technologies into even small cheap cars, relying on the company's procurement prowess to raise profits. 
VW was accused of stealing procurement know-how from General Motors (NYSE:GM) under Piech's watch but he was never charged with a crime.
He also cultivated unconditional loyalty from his top engineers, even while sometimes keeping them in the dark. 
While working as development chief at Audi, Piech decided to hide the aerodynamic qualities of the Audi 100 from his top staff by using wind tunnels in Hamburg, Stuttgart, Wolfsburg and Turin to develop the vehicle.
He wanted to take the brand upmarket by touting its aerodynamic qualities, but was fearful that an engineer could defect to a rival with crucial know-how. 
""I was in the middle of it all, putting together the pieces of the puzzle,"" Piech said in his autobiography.
Piech introduced quattro four-wheel drive technology to Audi, and transformed it into a credible competitor to Mercedes-Benz and BMW.
Max Warburton, an analyst at Bernstein Research, described Piech as the architect of VW’s global success. 
""His stewardship of VW has been indisputably successful. Piech will go down in history as an automotive legend, in the same class as Gottlieb Daimler, Henry Ford and Kiichiro Toyoda,"" Warburton said in a 2012 note.
Piech, resigned as Volkswagen chairman in April 2015 after falling out with his chief executive Martin Winterkorn. The emissions cheating scandal would erupt only months later. 

The fourth generation of the Porsche and Piech families now sit on the board of directors of Porsche Automobil Holding SE (DE:PSHG_p), which controls a 52.2 percent stake in Volkswagen, the world's largest carmaker.

1274,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 26, 2019 07:46PM ET</span>",Australia plans more action against big banks on money laundering,"MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Australia's big banks will face potential penalties within the next six months for breaching money laundering laws, Australia's financial intelligence agency head said on Tuesday.
AUSTRAC Chief Executive Nicole Rose said banks have stepped up self-reporting of breaches to the agency by 70% since it launched civil action against Commonwealth Bank of Australia (AX:CBA) two years ago.
""I can say that we will have more enforcement action in the next six months - warnings all the way through to civil penalty - because of the increased intelligence that we've been receiving. There will be appropriate action,"" Rose said in an interview on Australian Broadcasting Corp radio.
Rose did not name any of the targeted banks.
CBA was lumped with an additional A$1 billion capital requirement in 2018 after it was accused of thousands of breaches, mostly for late filing of transaction reports. The rest of Australia's Big Four - Westpac Banking Corp (AX:WBC), Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd (AX:ANZ) and National Australia Bank Ltd (AX:NAB) - were required to set aside an additional A$500 million each the following year.
Rose said there had been ""very little evidence"" to date of any deliberate breaches of anti-money laundering laws.
Australia's casinos have also been in the frame for some time for potential breaches of anti-money laundering and countering terrorism financing laws, with AUSTRAC looking since last year at the risks around casino junkets, she said.
Those probes were not specifically related to recent media reports claiming that  Crown  Resorts (AX:CWN) hired travel agents with ties to drug traffickers to bring Chinese gamblers into Australia and knowingly laundered money at its casinos, Rose said. Crown has denied the allegations.
""The big casinos are very good at complying with our anti-money laundering/countering terrorism financing laws and they put a great deal of effort into ensuring that they do,"" Rose said."

What's not clear is if Monday's rally was simply a rebound from Friday's savage downturn or something more meaningful.
That will take time to sort out. The S&P 500 rose 1.1% thanks to late buying. The Dow Jones industrials , up 1% on the day, or 271 points, had been up as much 312 points, or 1.2% right after the open. 
The Nasdaq Composite, with many tech companies directly affected by the ongoing U.S. trade fight, was up 1.3%. And we'll note the Nasdaq 100 Index was up 1.47%, thanks to the late surge. Its leader was Jd.Com (NASDAQ:JD), up 3.4%. It is an online retailer in China.
Interest rates rose modestly.
The rally's catalyst was President Donald Trump. First, he said China was willing to make a trade deal and he said he'd be willing to meet with Iran's president, if the conditions were right.
That was good news for traders and the algorithms that govern many markets. All 30 Dow stocks were higher, along with 94 Nasdaq-100 stocks. The Dow leaders included   Nike   (NYSE:NKE), Walt   Disney   (NYSE:DIS) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). All three have huge stakes in China and Disney is getting a boost as it nears launching its steaming video service in November.
Hasbro (NASDAQ:HAS) jumped about 3%, fourth among Nasdaq 100 stocks, because many of the toys it sells are made in China.
Celgene (NASDAQ:CELG) and Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN) were second and third among Nasdaq 100 stocks, rising more than 3%. Amgen will buy Celgene's psoriasis drug Otezla for $13.5 billion in cash. And Celgene is a step closer to merging with Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY) in a $74 billion deal.
After the close, Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) was up more than 5.2% after a federal judge in Oklahoma found the company responsible for fueling the opioid crisis in that state. He ordered the company to pay $572 million in damages in a case where the state had asked drug companies to pay up to $17 billion in damages. Two other companies settled out of court. Some 2,000 cases are awaiting trial against drug companies.
Johnson & Johnson had been up 0.8% in regular trading but down slightly on the year before the decision was announced.
While retailers such as Macy’s (NYSE:M) and Gap (NYSE:GPS) were weak,   Foot Locker   (NYSE:FL) led the S&P 500, followed by oil and chemical company TechnipFMC (NYSE:FTI),   DISH Network   (NASDAQ:DISH) and telecommunications company   CenturyLink   (NYSE:CTL). The S&P 500 laggards included Philip Morris International (NYSE:PM), women's apparel company L Brands (NYSE:LB), Gap and Alexion Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:ALXN).
 
 
The 10-year Treasury yield rose to 1.537% from Friday's 1.527%, but it is still off 42% this year. 
Oil prices fell because of the possibilities of a thaw in U.S.-Iranian relations. West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark U.S. crude, fell 53 cents to $53.64 a barrel. The November contract for Brent, the global crude benchmark, was off 68 cents to $58.12. Gold futures were down slightly at $1,537.20 an ounce in New York."

The quick-service restaurant will roll out its vegan menu items nationally based on the customer feedback from the Atlanta test, Yum said.
Yum is the latest big-chain restaurant jumping on the vegan bandwagon, a growing market as more fast-food chains tweak their menus to add new options for vegans and 'flexitarians'.

1280,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 26, 2019 04:29PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch,"Investing.com -- Here's the top three things that could rock markets tomorrow. 
1. Consumer Confidence Expected to Slow
Traders will look to consumer confidence numbers from the Conference Board on Tuesday for signs the U.S. economy remains on solid footing despite a slowdown in global growth.
Confidence is expected to ease to 129.5 in August from an 8-month high of 135.7 in July. 
The consumer is underpinning U.S. economic growth, but if sentiment and labor markets deteriorate, a recession could emerge as early as the beginning of next year, JPMorgan said.
“We continue to see significant risk of a recession beginning within a year if sentiment and labor markets deteriorate further but still believe it is too soon to conclude that a recession is the most likely outcome,JPMorgan added.
2. API Crude Inventories
The American Petroleum Institute on Tuesday releases a fresh batch of inventory data amid new concerns that a potential U.S.-Iran meeting could lead to supply and demand imbalance.
Crude oil futures erased gains to settle 1% lower at $53.64 a barrel on fears a fresh wave of supply could hit the market after President Donald Trump said he is open to meeting Iran's President Hassan Rouhani “under the right circumstances.”
The American Petroleum Institute last week reported crude oil stockpiles fell by 3.5 million barrels.
3. Hewlett Packard, AutoDesk Earnings Due
Hewlett Packard Enterprise (NYSE:HPE) reports earnings after the closing bell on Tuesday. 
The company is expected to report third-quarter earnings of 40 cents per share, on revenues of $7.29 billion, down 0.4% year over year.
Its efforts to ramp up its software and data businesses are expected to ease the softness in hardware sales, mainly PCs and printers, amid the ongoing slowdown in China.
Autodesk (NASDAQ:ADSK) also reports quarterly results after the closing bell. The software maker is expected to report earnings of 61 cents a share on revenue of about $787 million. 
The software maker's earnings missed expectations on both the top and bottom lines, though some on Wall Street highlighted the company’s’ free cash flow generation and its efforts to accelerate construction digitization as positives.
In the previous earnings report, Autodesk (NASDAQ:ADSK) said it expected earnings per share of 59 cents to 63 cents in the second quarter, on $782 million to $792 million in revenue. "
1281,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 26, 2019 04:19PM ET</span>",Wall Street bounces as trade temperature cools,"By Chuck Mikolajczak
NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks rose on Monday, following a sharp sell-off in the prior session, after U.S. President Donald Trump predicted a trade deal with China, cooling investor concerns after a ramp-up in rhetoric derailed markets last week.
Following the G7 summit of world leaders in Biarritz, France, Trump said he believed China was sincere about the desire to reach a deal, citing what he described as increasing economic pressure on Beijing and job losses there.
Shares of tariff-sensitive companies rose in response. Apple Inc's (O:AAPL) 1.90% gain provided the biggest boost to each of the major indexes. 
Chipmakers, which are heavily reliant upon China for revenue, also rose. The Philadelphia Semiconductor index (SOX) added 0.86% after slumping more than 4% on Friday.
Still, market participants said the rebound paled in comparison to last week's decline, and they expected recent volatility to continue. 
""The markets are telling us something very important with this pricing action today. We are seeing some gains across the board for the Nasdaq S&P and Dow, but we are also seeing a very significant downtick in volume,"" said Peter Kenny, founder of Kenny’s Commentary LLC and Strategic Board Solutions LLC in New York. 
""This is not a healthy bounce and it is across virtually all the major indexes. So it is an indication the momentum for U.S. equities remains biased to the downside,"" Kenny said.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) rose 269.93 points, or 1.05%, to 25,898.83, the S&P 500 (SPX) gained 31.27 points, or 1.10%, to 2,878.38, and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) added 101.97 points, or 1.32%, to 7,853.74. 
Commerce Department data showed new orders for key U.S.-made capital goods rose modestly in July, while shipments fell by the most in nearly three years. The data could provide the Federal Reserve with more fuel to cut interest rates again when policymakers meet next month.
Concerns about the global economy slipping into recession and uncertainty over the pace of U.S. interest rate cuts have created some anxiety about how long the current U.S. expansion will last. The S&P 500 is off more than 5% from the record high hit in late July after suffering its longest run of weekly declines since May.
Even with Monday's broad gains, with each of the major S&P 500 sectors rising, Wall Street's fear gauge, the CBOE Volatility index (VIX), hit its highest level in more than a week earlier in the session.
Among other stocks,  Celgene Corp  (O:CELG) rose 3.20% after  Amgen Inc  (O:AMGN) said it would buy the company's psoriasis drug Otezla, clearing the way for Bristol-Myers Squibb Co (N:BMY) to go ahead with its $74 billion deal for Celgene. Shares of Bristol-Myers rose 3.28% 
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.66-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.74-to-1 ratio favored advancers.
The S&P 500 posted four new 52-week highs and 17 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 17 new highs and 134 new lows. 

About 5.71 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges, compared with the 7.57 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions.

Read the developments in real time.

G-7 Statement on Trade, Iran, Libya, Ukraine, HK (6:19 p.m.)
Instead of the usual detailed communique, Macron released a one-page statement that he said he’d written himself, drafting language after each session and checking with his fellow leaders.
On trade, it endorses fair and open global trade, and calls for reforms of the WTO to boost intellectual property protection and tackle unfair trading practices more quickly.
On Iran, which became one of the key issues of the summit, leaders agreed Iran shouldn’t obtain nuclear weapons and they should support regional stability.
On Ukraine, France and Germany will organize talks with Kiev and Russia in the coming weeks.
On Libya, the G-7 called for a lasting cease-fire and a peace conference.
And on Hong Kong, leaders underlined the importance of the 1984 joint declaration between China and the U.K. That statement set out the basis for how Hong Kong should be governed following its return to China, including its distinct rights and freedoms from the rest of China. The Beijing government in 2017 said that agreement no longer has any bearing.
Macron Says He’s Worried About Global Growth (6:03 p.m.)
The French president, in his closing press conference, highlighted risks to the global economy. He said G-7 leaders agreed that they need to modernize the global trading system and make the WTO more efficient.
Trump Eases Rhetoric on EU With Auto Tariffs (5:41 p.m.)
Trump said he thinks he’ll be able to reach a new settlement with the EU on the terms of trade without having to impose tariffs on European cars.
""We are very close to doing a deal with the EU,"" he said.
""They don’t want tariffs, it’s very simple,"" he added. ""I think I’m going to make a deal with the EU without having to go that route.""
Trump Says Russia Better Inside the G-7 (5:24 p.m.)
Trump says he is not alone in wanting to have Russia ushered back into the fold of the G-7: ""Having them in the room is better than having them outside the room"" and ""a lot of people say having Russia inside the room is better than having them outside.""
In conclusion: ""My inclination is to say yes they should be in.""
Whether Putin accepts is another matter: ""He’s a proud person. I would certainly invite him. Whether or not he could come psychologically that’s a tough thing to do.""
Macron Lays Thinking About Zarif Surprise Visit (5:06 p.m.)
The French president said that he never spoke on behalf of other countries and that he only tried and tested other solutions. Before making the call to fly the Iranian top diplomat into Biarritz, ""I informed trump, not to involve the U.S. not to talk on behalf of the U.S., but to inform. So I did it on my own, I informed Trump, he was informed at each minute.”
Trump Says Circumstances Must be Right (5:01 p.m.)
After Macron raised the stakes with his prediction that a Trump meeting with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani could lead to a new agreement, Trump he would meet Rouhani ""if the circumstances were correct.""
He said Iran is not the same country it was two and a half years ago. ""Iran is a country of tremendous potential,"" he said. ""We are not looking for leadership change.""
Iran has been one of the key issues of this summit after Trump and Macron scuffled over the French president’s mandate to handle communication with Tehran. Trump ultimately acquiesced in Macron’s plan to bring the Iranian foreign minister to Biarritz after he was tipped off by the French leader.
At a certain point there needs to be a meeting between Trump and Rouhani, Macron said. The real change, for Macron, was that Rouhani this morning said he would ready for that meeting.
Trump Says China Really Wants a Trade Deal ’Badly’ (4:48 p.m.)
Asked if he thought China was stringing the U.S. along and that the negotiations were stuck, Trump disagree: ""I think they want to make a deal very badly.""
Trump gave his rationale: ""I think they’re very smart and I think president Xi is a great leader... He can’t lose 3 million jobs in a very short period of time” so ""maybe they want to (do a deal) or maybe they don’t but not not sure they have a choice.”
France, U.S. Reach Deal on Internet Taxes (4:44 p.m.)
Macron says he’s reached an agreement on France’s digital tax that will avert potential U.S. tariffs on French wine. France agrees to adhere to whatever proposal the OECD comes up with and Macron forecasts that this should be agreed next year. ""This deal is good for both sides,"" he says.
Macron Wants to Bring Trump Rouhani Together (4:39 p.m.)
It is clear that Macron’s big plan is to bring together Trump and the Iranian President Hassan Rouhani. He disclosed the idea next to Trump, during the joint press conference. Now what will Trump say, when asked?
He had warm words for the lunch he and Trump shared, where many key decisions were made, including get on the same page on Iran: ""Our lunch together was productive and dynamic. We agree that Iran must respect its nuclear obligations.”
Macron Discusses Decision to Bring Zarif to Biarritz (4:37 p.m.)
The president said he realizes that the situation in Iran is still fragile.
Macron Points to a One-Page Statement (4:34 p.m.)
Macron points to a one-page statement that displaces the old format. He wanted to have a joint press conference to pass the baton to Trump, to show continuity. He said neither of them like to waste time.
Merkel Wants to Start on Trade Talks With U.S. (1:35 p.m.)
The chancellor said she wants to the EU and the U.S. to start trade negotiations using the bloc’s existing mandate -- which excludes agriculture, a key French demand. But she also signaled that she would be open to broadening the mandate further down the line.
""Most important would be that these talks begin,"" Merkel told reporters at her final press conference. ""I’ve lobbied for that here, even if one assumes that this cannot be the complete agenda yet. I hope that the talks will begin on the basis of the existing mandate which the EU has got from the member states.""
Merkel Welcomes Progress on Iran (12:53 p.m.)
Iran has been one of the big focuses of attention at this summit and Merkel was upbeat about what’s been achieved. In a nutshell, Trump gave his blessing to French efforts to lead the outreach even though the U.S. isn’t ready to get involved.
“There is an atmosphere at this summit in which talks are welcome, talks of Europe with Iran and especially of France with Iran,” she said. “This happens in coordination with the U.S. and that’s already a lot.”
“What will come out of this we cannot say today,” she went on. “But the firm will to talk is already a big step forward.”
G-7 in Miami? (11:47 a.m.)
Trump is already thinking that next year’s G-7 summit in the United States should be in Miami -- and perhaps more specifically centered around his own property at Trump Doral golf resort.
“We haven’t found anything that could even come close to competing” with Doral, Trump said, stressing the no final decisions have been made.
Trump cited the advantages of a global summit in Miami, telling German Chancellor Angela Merkel ahead of their meeting this morning that she would be just a three-minute helicopter ride from the airport to the site.
Trump has already run afoul of ethics experts and faced multiple lawsuits over his continued involvement with some of his private business, such as the Trump International Hotel in Washington. Located a global summit on one of his properties would open him up to a slew of new allegations that he’s mixing his private financial gain with his public position as commander in chief.
Doral is definitely built more for play than work, and its website boasts that it’s only eight miles for the Miami airport. It’s 800 acres, boasts four golf courses and 643 rooms, plus more than 100,000 square feet of event space -- including the Donald J. Trump Grand Ballroom.
Trump and Merkel Make Nice Ahead of Bilateral (11:37 a.m.)
The president and the chancellor looked more comfortable than they often have in the past, swapping jokes and laughing together in front of reporters before heading into private talks.
There was policy substance too. Both said there has been progress on Iran and agreed they have to prevent Iran obtaining nuclear weapons.
Trump said the G-7 has found “great unity” on Iran. Merkel said there is movement on the issue but there’s still a long way to go.
France, U.S. Draft Deal on Internet Tax (9:40 a.m.)
On the sidelines of the leaders’ negotiations in Biarritz, French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire has been holding meetings with his U.S. counterpart Steven Mnuchin and other members of Trump’s economic policy team.
They’ve agreed a draft deal to prevent an escalation of the tensions over a new French tax on internet giants that had riled the U.S. administration, a French finance minister official said.
Under the terms of the deal, France will pledge to respect any policy agreed at the OECD and refund internet companies the difference if the tax is lower than the one France has already introduced. The U.S., in return, won’t impose retaliatory tariffs on French wines.
Now Trump and Macron have to decide whether they will accept the deal. They have a joint press conference at 3:30 p.m.
Trump Knew of Zarif Visit, Supported Invitation (9:20 a.m.)
One of the biggest questions hanging over Sunday’s surprise visit of Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif was when Trump was told. He answered the question himself this morning.
“He spoke to me, he asked me, I said if you want to do that, that’s OK,” Trump said at a morning meeting Egypt’s Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi. “I don’t consider that disrespectful at all, especially when he asks me for approval.”
China Wants to Talk Trade (9:01 a.m.)
Trump told reporters that the Chinese government called his team in Washington Sunday in a bid to restart talks on trade. The two countries both raised tariffs last week as their trade war escalated.
“China called last night our trade people and said let’s get back to the table,” Trump said. “They understand how life works.”
The president said the U.S. would accept the Chinese invitation and return to the negotiations."
1284,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 26, 2019 03:41PM ET</span>",Amgen to buy Celgene psoriasis drug Otezla for $13.4 billion,"By Michael Erman and Manas Mishra
(Reuters) -  Amgen Inc  (NASDAQ:AMGN) will buy Celgene (NASDAQ:CELG) Corp's psoriasis drug Otezla for $13.4 billion in cash, clearing the way for Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY) to go ahead with its $74 billion deal for Celgene by the end of the year.
Amgen, which announced the deal on Monday, is paying a hefty price for the drug, according to analysts and investors. Still, Otezla, which brought in sales of $1.61 billion last year, will deliver growth for Amgen right away, and its shares rose around 3 percent in afternoon trading.
Bristol-Myers and Celgene's shares were both also up around 3 percent.
New York-based Bristol-Myers said in June that it would sell Otezla to allay concerns raised by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission because of a competing treatment that it is developing. Analysts said at the time that they were expecting Otezla to sell for around $8 billion to $10 billion.
Bristol-Myers said in a statement that there was significant interest from multiple potential buyers from early on in the process.
Thousand Oaks, California-based Amgen said that it expects Otezla's sales to grow at least in the low-double digits over the next five years. It also said it expects the drug's patents to protect its exclusivity in the United States until 2028.

Jeff Jonas, healthcare portfolio manager at Gabelli funds, said that a number of Amgen's current drugs face loss of patent protection and competition from biosimilar drugs, so the growth from Otezla would be welcome.
""This is an attractive product for them that fits more or less with their current portfolio,"" Jonas said. ""It's an approved product with a good safety profile, so there's not a lot of risk.""
Still, Jonas expressed some skepticism about Amgen's growth forecast for the drug, noting that new competitors, including Bristol-Myers' drug in development, are likely to eat into its market share.
Amgen said it expects the deal to produce tax benefits with a present cash value of $2.2 billion, reducing the actual deal total to $11.2 billion.
With respect to possible antitrust concerns about the purchase, Amgen said on a conference call that it feels very confident that it will be able to close the deal.
Bristol-Myers said most of the proceeds from the sale will go to pay down debt from the deal with Summit, New Jersey-based Celgene. It also increased a previously planned $5 billion accelerated share buyback to $7 billion.

1285,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 26, 2019 03:17PM ET</span>","StockBeat - Beyond Meat Hits Menu at KFC, Shares Surge","Investing.com – Beyond Meat climbed on Monday after Yum! Brands (NYSE:YUM) confirmed that it would launch a trial of the company’s plant-based chicken in an Atalanta restaurant. 
Beyond Fried Chicken will be available in nuggets for between $1.99 and $8.49 and boneless wings for between $6 and $12, both based on the number of pieces, at the Cobb Parkway KFC in Atlanta in a limited test, KFC said in a statement. 
Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND) surged 5% and Yum! Brands (NYSE:YUM) climbed 1.6%.
""KFC Beyond Fried Chicken is so delicious, our customers will find it difficult to tell that it's plant based,"" said Kevin Hochman, president and chief concept officer at KFC U.S. ""I think we've all heard 'it tastes like chicken.' Well, our customers are going to be amazed and say, 'it tastes like Kentucky Fried Chicken!'""
Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND) is known for making its name in the beef business, but chicken is where it all started for the company. 
The company launched its chicken-free mock chicken products in Whole Foods supermarkets across the U.S. in April 2013. In 2014, it launched a beef product.
Its foray into chicken did not prove successful at first, with the company pulling its Beyond Chicken Strips product from grocery-store shelves earlier this year.
But now, with its product hitting the menu at a KFC restaurant, Beyond Meat is seemingly fulfilling some of its promise outlined by JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in a recent note. 
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) raised its rating on the stock to overweight from neutral and lifted its target price to $189 a share from $188 a share last week. The bank outlined an attractive valuation on continued signs of rising dollar takeaway growth (a measure of performance in the food sector) and the potential to acquire new food-service customers as supportive factors.
Shares are up more than 500% since the company went public at $25 on May 1. It has a consensus price target of $165.43 among analysts' forecasts compiled by Investing.com."

Basilio had been Heinz's finance chief when it merged with Kraft in 2015 and remained in the role in the unified company until October 2017, when Kraft Heinz's second largest shareholder 3G Capital persuaded the board to embark on changes centering around heavy cost-cutting. 
Under 31-year old Knopf, who would return to his role as a partner at 3G Capital, Kraft Heinz has this year written down $15.4 billion in the value of two marquee brands, slashed dividends and withdrawn its financial outlook.
The change is the first big move by new CEO Miguel Patricio since the Portuguese marketing veteran was brought in from  Anheuser-Busch InBev  (BR:ABI) in April with the aim of rebooting Kraft Heinz.
The packaged food company, which counts billionaire Warren Buffett as its largest investor, has been battered by competition from private-label brands, changing consumer tastes and lower investment in its brands.
An internal investigation into the company's accounting issues in May required adjustments of about $208 million related to the costs of products sold, while saying that there had been no misconduct from any member of Kraft Heinz's senior management.
Shares of the company, which have lost nearly half of their value since February, were up nearly 1% in morning trading.

Allan Hillgrove, head of pharmaceuticals and biopharma and a company veteran of 37 years, will retire at the end of the year and will be replaced by Carine Brouillon, who joined unlisted Boehringer from Johnson & Johnson (N:JNJ) in 2018.

1304,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 26, 2019 09:50AM ET</span>","For Baffled Wall Street, Trump Markets Are ‘Weirder’ Than the 2008 Crisis","(Bloomberg) -- Donald Trump’s trying to win a trade war, so don’t talk to him about 600 points in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. But for traders coping with the price impact of his tirades, it’s all they want to talk about.
Days like Friday are creating stress in the trenches. A decade ago, Max Gokhman was a 24-year-old at the center of the storm, buying and selling toxifying credit contracts at a hedge fund he founded. Now head of asset allocation at Pacific Life Fund Advisors, he says those days barely compare when it comes to the unpredictability he’s facing daily.
“I used to tell people trading credit derivatives through 2008 was crazy, but this is way weirder,” said Gokhman. Back then, “the liquidity is what made it challenging to put on or take off your positions. Now every part of the market has its own idiosyncrasy, and at the top you have Trump, who can wreak havoc in really creative ways nobody’s thought of before.”
While the stakes were higher in the financial crisis, with global economies on the brink of a depression, for people in markets it was mostly a one-way trade. The number of parts moving now presents a unique challenge, says Gokhman, with the Federal Reserve inciting hair-trigger swings in banks, bond yields and currency while earnings season knocks stocks like  Target  Corp. (NYSE:TGT) and Macy’s Inc. up and down 10% or 20% a day.
Maybe that would be fine if it weren’t for the president, whose Twitter blowups have gotten harder to navigate -- somehow -- as the summer dragged on. August is often a rough month for traders but this one has already seen the S&P swing at least 1% in nine out of 17 trading sessions, a record of volatility not seen since equities were crashing in December.
Turbulence showed no sign of abating Monday. After plunging at the open, S&P 500 futures reversed course and rallied after Trump said prospects for a deal with China are better now than at any time since negotiations began. About half the gain was pared after a top state-media editor in Beijing questioned his version of events.
Anticipation made it anything a restful weekend for Donald Selkin, chief market strategist at Newbridge Securities Corp.
“I’ve been waiting all day. You anticipate these things. You had the feeling that things would go down because of the announcement of the latest increase in tariffs,” Selkin said. “All weekend long, you figured that they’d go lower -- the question was how much.”
Friday’s gyrations were a new chapter for many veterans, proof that no blueprint exists. After watching index futures get felled by China’s $75 billion tariff counter-punch, bulls were relieved to see Powell push them back to green with a needle-threading speech at Jackson Hole. Trump summarily lambasted the Fed for doing “NOTHING!,” compared Powell with Xi Jinping and said he’d get back to everyone with a response. Wall Street had no recourse but to sit there as stocks slid almost 3% in the ensuing vacuum.
“If I tell you ‘I’m going to punch you,’ that’s not as bad as me telling you, ‘I’m going to hurt you in a way that I’m not even going to tell you about,”’ Steve Chiavarone, a fund manager with Federated Investors, said in an interview. “Hey, something bad’s coming, hold on.”
These aren’t people who oppose everything Trump is doing. “We did need to resolve outstanding issues with China,” says Gokhman, though a coordinated approach with other countries that focused on intellectual property theft would’ve been preferable to a “sporadic” one that risks stymieing capital investment.
To Chiavarone, 35, it’s “absolutely a battle worth fighting.” A technological revolution is going on, “and the country that controls the intellectual capital that’s driving that revolution will very likely be the world’s preeminent power,” he said. Still, tactics matter, “and undoubtedly the ratcheting up of tariffs has a negative impact on earnings, sentiment and financial markets.”
In remarks to reporters Friday, Trump played down his impact on markets this month, pointing to the rally in stocks since he took office -- 49% in the Dow average on a total-return basis. “We’re at 25,000, so don’t tell me about 600 points,” he said. He reiterated the point in a tweet Sunday night, saying, “Had my opponent won, CRASH!”
Equities are smartly up in 2019 and despite swings that lifted the Cboe Volatility Index average 40% in August versus July, the S&P 500 has fallen just 5.9% from its July 26 record. On the other hand, with Friday’s drop, it’s down four straight weeks and has slipped below the highest level of January 2018, meaning anyone who bought stocks during that month’s surge is nursing losses.
“Sentiment is sentiment and it can become a bit of a self fulfilling prophecy if it goes on long enough,” said Nathan Thooft, Manulife Asset Management’s head of global asset allocation. “Investors -- retail and professionals -- run the risk of getting whipsawed. And it certainly appears that they have been based on the quick back and forth moves of the market.”

The stakebuilding by KKR in concert with with Friede Springer, the widow of the company's founder, and CEO Mathias Doepfner is aimed at taking the publisher private by the end of the year or in the first quarter of 2020.
KKR achieved a 42.5% stake with its tender to buy out minority shareholders and bought a further 1.04% on the market, putting it ahead of Friede Springer's 42.6% and Doepfner's 2.8%.
The buyout offer, at 63 euros per share, valued the business at 6.8 billion euros, representing a 40% premium to the share price preceding the June 12 offer.

1307,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 26, 2019 08:37AM ET</span>",Global stocks edge higher as Trump acts to ease China trade tensions,"By Tommy Wilkes and Dhara Ranasinghe
LONDON (Reuters) - Stock markets clawed themselves off their lows on Monday but sentiment remained fragile after the latest flare-up in the U.S.-China trade war sent investors scrambling into government bonds and battered emerging market currencies.
European equity markets had looked set to follow Asian markets deep into the red but recovered when U.S. President Donald Trump moved to ease tensions with China after more tariffs - abruptly announced on Friday - deepened concerns about the impact of the conflict on global growth. 
Speaking on the sidelines of a summit of major industrialized nations in France, Trump hailed Chinese President Xi Jinping as a great leader and said he welcomed his desire for a trade deal and for calm - soothing investors' nerves. Beijing called for calm.
Wall Street futures rallied, with S&P 500 e-minis up 0.5% ahead of the open. 
European stock markets were mixed, with the pan-European Eurostoxx down marginally on the day. Germany's DAX rose 0.29% while France's managed a 0.5% rise. London markets were closed for a holiday.
Stocks had fallen sharply in Asia before Trump spoke as investors panicked that the latest tit-for-tat tariffs would damage global growth. On Friday, Trump announced an additional duty on some $550 billion of targeted Chinese goods, hours after China unveiled retaliatory tariffs on $75 billion worth of U.S. goods.
The MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, remained 0.3% lower by 1205 GMT. 
""Trump is clearly potentially exposed to a slower U.S. economy impacting his capability to be re-elected. He is aware of this and so reacts to market volatility with some kinder words,"" said Chris Bailey, European strategist at Raymond James.
""The Chinese have seen him blink and have filed this away for use later. Shorter-term I think this is the basis of some tentative deal,"" he added.
Despite the more positive tone in stock markets, assets deemed safe havens remained well supported. The 10-year U.S. Treasury bond yield hit a new 3-year low at 1.449% before rising to 1.518% - still a touch lower on the day.
It is down some 50 basis points so far this month.
The price of gold, which has risen sharply in recent months as nervous investors flocked to the precious metal, touched its highest since April 2013 and was last up 0.3% at $1,531.
Germany Bund yields did reverse their earlier falls. The 10-year bond rose 1 basis point to -0.664%, having earlier dropped to as low as -0.70%. 
YUAN HITS 11-YEAR LOW
Emerging market currencies were among the biggest casualties of the latest trade war-induced volatility. 
China's yuan plunged to an 11-year low in the onshore market and hit a record low in offshore trading . It later recovered somewhat in the offshore market but remained 0.3% lower at 7.1552 yuan per dollar.
Turkey's lira dropped more than 1% to more than 5.8 against the dollar on Monday after briefly sliding to 6.47 in what market watchers described as a ""flash crash"" as Japanese investors slashed their exposure to riskier assets.
The lira was last down 0.8% at 5.8130. 
Elsewhere in currency markets, the safe-haven Japanese yen rallied to a new seven-month high of 104.46 yen per dollar before reversing those gains to trade down 0.5% at 105.86 as calm returned to markets.
The dollar rose broadly and was up 0.2% versus the euro at $1.1117.
As investors try to navigate the year-long trade conflict between the world's two biggest economies, some are choosing to cut their exposure to stocks believing the battle is taking its toll on global growth.
""Downside risks are increasing for both the global economy and markets,"" said Mark Haefele, global chief investment officer at UBS. ""As a result, we are reducing risk in our portfolios by moving to an underweight in equities to lower our exposure to political uncertainty.""
German business sentiment deteriorated more than expected in August to hit its lowest since November 2012, a survey by Germany's Ifo Institute showed on Monday.
The latest trade escalation overshadowed a pledge by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell last week to ""act as appropriate"" to keep the U.S. economy healthy, although he stopped short of committing to rapid-fire rate cuts.
Markets are now fully priced for at least a quarter-point cut from the Fed in September and more than 120 basis points of easing by the end of 2020.
Oil prices, which had earlier fallen on concerns the tariff dispute would crimp world demand, recovered in European trading. 
Brent crude futures rose 0.67% to $59.74 per barrel, while U.S. crude gained 1.02% to $54.72 a barrel.

1308,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 26, 2019 07:39AM ET</span>",Treasury Rally Cools as Trump Signals China Trade Talks Back On,"(Bloomberg) -- Terms of Trade is a daily newsletter that untangles a world embroiled in trade wars. Sign up here. 
A rally in Treasuries slowed to take 10-year yields off a three-year low after U.S. President Donald Trump said that China had asked to restart trade talks.
Benchmark U.S. yields steadied in New York after sliding to their lowest since July 2016 at 1.44% during Asian trading. Signs that talks could resume drew investors out of haven assets as weekend concerns faded that a bruising trade war will hamper global growth. German bonds slipped along with the yen and Swiss franc.
Trump said U.S. officials received two “very productive” calls from Chinese officials, hours after Beijing’s top negotiator publicly called for calm in response to tit-for-tat tariff increases. Still, overnight index swaps are pricing in at least two rate cuts by the Federal Reserve by the end of the year, after Chairman Jerome Powell warned Friday that the U.S. economy faces “significant risks.”
“This trade war is having more plot twists than a Quentin Tarantino movie,” Edward Moya, a senior market analyst at Oanda Corp. in New York, said in a note. “While President Trump appears determined to assert a dominant negotiation position as we were expecting to enter the possible final rounds of talks, he may have overplayed his hand.”
The latest comments emerging from the Group-of-Seven meeting on Monday in Biarritz, France are a turnaround from Friday’s escalation in the trade conflict, when China threatened to impose additional tariffs on $75 billion of American goods. That prompted Trump to say he’ll hike existing duties on about $250 billion in Chinese goods, while a new round of tariffs on $300 billion of goods will be taxed at 15%, up from 10%.
China also sought to bring a measure of calm back to markets on Monday, with Caixin reporting that Vice Premier Liu He said the two sides should seek to resolve the dispute through talks. While his comments helped to reverse yen gains, their impact will be limited unless the trade frictions between the U.S. and China are resolved, said Tadashi Matsukawa, head of fixed-income investment at PineBridge Investments Japan.
U.S. 10-year yields were down two basis points at 1.51% by 12 p.m. in London and German bund yields gained one basis points to minus 0.66%. The Swiss franc fell 0.6% against the dollar, while the yen slipped 0.4% after rallying to the strongest in almost three years versus the dollar.
 Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). warned the worst might not be over for markets.
“Escalation of the trade war could extend the bond rally further, with increased probability that U.S. 10s revisit all-time yield lows set in 2016,” wrote a team of strategists at Goldman Sachs including Praveen Korapaty. “Cross-border flows into U.S. dollar fixed income, driven by a surge in negative yielding debt, may not moderate without broad improvement in data.”
Globally, the pile of negative-yielding debt has surged to roughly $16 trillion as major central banks increasingly turn dovish amid slowing growth. Treasuries have gained 8.4%, leaving them on track for their best annual performance since 2011, according to the Bloomberg  Barclays  (LON:BARC) U.S. Treasury Index.
Trump’s renewed criticism of Powell on Friday, coupled with his call to U.S. companies operating in China to consider leaving, had pummeled markets going into the G-7 weekend. This backdrop also sent a key slice of the yield curve, which is closely watched as a gauge of an impending recession, further into inversion as traders’ viewed the growth outlook as more dire and ramp up bets the Fed cuts.
The gap between three-month rates and yields on 10-year Treasury notes fell Monday to a low of minus 53 basis points, the most inverted since March 2007.
“The market expects substantial rate cuts but the Fed isn’t moving along that line,” said Naokazu Koshimizu, senior rates strategist at Nomura Securities Co. in Tokyo. “Short-dated yields are struggling to fall even amid concern over a deterioration in the U.S. economy, leaving the yield curve prone to inversion."

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Tencent Holdings (HK:0700) on Monday unveiled a version of its popular social media app WeChat tailor-made for drivers with state-backed Chinese carmaker China Chang'an Automobile Group, marking a further foray into transportation solutions. 
China's most popular messenger, with more than 1.1 billion users, will be embedded in new car models coming to the market later this year, the two companies said at the annual Smart China Expo in Chongqing. 
While the mobile app offers services such as payment and entertainment, the car version will have limited functions based on voice control and a button on the wheel, allowing the driver to send or receive messages and make calls while driving, and integrate Tencent Map's navigation service, Tencent said. 
Tencent, which is trying to transform itself from a consumer-oriented social and gaming firm to an enterprise service provider, said in a statement it had secured partnership agreements with 21 automakers including BMW, Mercedes-Benz and Audi to roll out solutions for connected cars on 45 models.

China's state-run news agency Xinhua said on Monday 530 deals worth 817 billion yuan ($115.2 billion) had been signed at the Smart China Expo.

UBS Global Wealth Management, which oversees more than $2.48 trillion in invested assets, has gone underweight on equities for the first time since the euro-zone crisis.
The Swiss asset manager cut its stock positioning relative to high-grade bonds to reduce its exposure to trade wars and political uncertainty, Global Chief Investment Officer Mark Haefele wrote in a note to investors.
“Risks to the global economy and markets have increased, following a renewed escalation in U.S.-China trade tensions,” said Haefele, who had so far resisted turning bearish on stocks since the world’s two biggest economies began their trade feud last year. U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision last Friday to increase tariffs on $250 billion of Chinese goods to 30% from 25% prompted the downgrade.
The change factors in a new underweight position in emerging market stocks, which “are more exposed to heightened market volatility, a slowing global economy, and heightened trade tensions,” Haefele wrote. Earlier this month, the bank more than halved its 2019 earnings forecast for Asia to 2.8% from 6.3%, and said Taiwan and Korea will likely bear the brunt of the slowdown due to their reliance on trade and technology.
Haefele cautioned “against large equity underweights” and maintained his view that the U.S. can avoid a recession in 2020. And not everyone is ready to throw in the towel on stocks yet.
Paul Sandhu, head of multi-assets quant solutions and client advisory at  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) Asset Management, said he expects fund flows to return to Asia if the U.S.-China trade situation “comes together.” He said that investors can take advantage of a potentially weaker U.S. dollar, and that a decline in flows to the region will soon reach an “inflection point such that asset allocation decisions are going to have to be made in favor of those markets.”
While U.S. stock-index futures rose in the European morning after Trump said Beijing was willing to resume trade talks, they pared some of the gain after China appeared to contradict that statement.
Earlier on Monday, renewed tensions from last week left a sea of red in Asian stock markets, with the MSCI Asia Pacific index down as much as 1.8%. Nomura cut its rating on the MSCI Hong Kong Index to underweight from overweight, citing concerns over the impact of a weaker yuan on H.K. dollar-priced stocks.

“This is the first time I’ve seen them where they really do want to make a deal, and I think that’s a very positive step,” Trump said.
The Chinese Foreign Ministry said it was not aware of any phone calls between the two nations but Vice Premier Liu He said he wanted to solve their trade differences as calmly as possible. Tensions escalated on Friday after both the U.S. and China announced new tariff measures and Trump appeared to threaten to use emergency powers to force U.S. companies to stop making goods in China.

Investing.com -- Europe’s stock markets were mixed on Monday under the impact of another dramatic escalation of the U.S.-China trade war over the weekend.
Markets appeared deeply unsettled by comments by President Donald Trump over the weekend suggesting that he would invoke emergency powers to impose an effective boycott on China, and losses would have been steeper had it not been for yet more comments by Trump on Monday morning. 
Trump claimed at a press conference on the sidelines of the G7 summit in Biarritz, France, that he had received two calls from China over the weekend, asking to resume trade talks. A Chinese foreign ministry spokesman was reported as saying that he wasn’t aware of any such request, but Trump’s comments came only hours after China’s top trade official, Liu He, was quoted in a speech as calling for “calm” in resolving the trade dispute.
Markets had ended last week on a negative note after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell had indicated central banks would struggle to offset the negative impacts of disruptive trade policies.
By 5 AM ET (0900 GMT), the benchmark Euro Stoxx 600 was down less than 0.1% at 371.20, having recovered from a two-week low of 369.08 at the opening.
Germany’s DAX was up 0.2% despite signs of a further deterioration in business confidence in August. The Ifo business climate index fell to a new seven-year low, with businesses becoming gloomier both about current conditions and the outlook. 
“Major concern next to industrial crisis mood a la 2009, is the marked deterioration in the service sector,” Katharina Utermoehl, a senior economist with Allianz (DE:ALVG), said via Twitter.
The figures came a day after German central bank president Jens Weidmann said he didn’t think the time was ripe for a large-scale fiscal stimulus package.
Elsewhere, the Italian FTSE MIB was the standout performer, up 0.6%, on reports that the center-left Democratic Party is edging towards an agreement on forming a new coalition with the 5 Stars Movement, having allegedly dropped its opposition to Giuseppe Conte remaining Prime Minister.

1314,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 26, 2019 05:06AM ET</span>",Berlin city rent cap plans hit real estate shares,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Shares in German property companies fell on Monday after media reported the Berlin city government plans a tougher-than-expected cap on rents, below what is currently charged in prime locations.
Shares in Deutsche Wohnen -- the German capital's biggest landlord -- were down 3.6% at 0756 GMT while those of DAX-listed Vonovia shed 2%. Other real estate stocks were down as well.
""Leaked details for the Berlin rent freeze draft law show that this might end up rather as a rent cut than a rent freeze,"" analysts with Jefferies said in a note.
Local daily Tagesspiegel at the weekend published details of a bill drafted by the city administration's housing department.
Berlin monthly rents for apartments built up to 2013 would be capped at 7.97 euros per square meter -- regardless of their location in the city, the report said.
This would be lower than current rents for many apartments in prime locations.
Landlords could charge a maximum of 0.57 euros more per square meter if they made improvements including installing modern heating systems, Tagesspiegel reported.
The draft is still subject to discussions and could still change, the paper added.
The local Berlin government was not immediately available to comment.
Berlin's city government -- made up of center-left Social Democrats, the far-left Linke and the Greens -- decided in June to freeze rents for five years, heeding complaints from residents that their once affordable city was pricing them out.
Analysts have said the rent freeze could worsen Germany's housing crisis as it would scare off real estate investors eager to build in urban centers.
Though rents have risen in the city with a population of 3.6 million, they are still low compared with London or Paris.
Vonovia on Monday repeated its criticism. ""We remain convinced that the rent freeze law planned by the Berlin State Government is unconstitutional,"" it said.
The company stuck to its 2019 guidance but said that if the reported plans for the rent ceiling were to become part of the final law, it may see a one-off rental income reduction for its Berlin portfolio of about 20 million to 25 million euros.
""With regards to the valuation of our Berlin portfolio it will not be possible to estimate the impact, if any, until there is sufficient transaction evidence,"" Vonovia said.
Deutsche Wohnen is Berlin's biggest landlord with more than 115,000 apartments in the German capital while Vonovia owns more than 42,000."

(Reuters) - Technology stocks pushed European equities to a one-week low on Monday as investors fled from riskier assets after another exchange of blows between the United States and China over trade at the end of last week.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday hit back at a new round of Chinese tariffs by heaping an additional 5% duty on some $550 billion in targeted Chinese goods and demanded that U.S. companies move their operations out of China.
Losses in Europe were not as dramatic as those in Asia overnight, after Trump on Monday said China had contacted U.S. trade officials overnight to say they wanted to return to the negotiating table.
But after falling half a percent at opening to hit its lowest level since Aug 16, the pan-European STOXX 600 index (STOXX) was down 0.33% by 0755 GMT.
""It's exactly according to our base case scenario which is that trade war will continue to escalate, that's also the reason why we don't put too much value to the latest comments,"" said Teeuwe Mevissen, a senior market economist at Rabobank.
""We don't see a solution in the short term.""
Trading volumes were thinned out by a UK holiday (FTSE), but the declines were broad-based, with the technology index (SX8P), the most exposed to tariffs, the biggest loser with a 0.59% fall.
European stocks have been volatile throughout August and worries the U.S.-China conflict will force the economy into recession currently have the STOXX on course to lose around 4%. On the other hand, investors continue to expect major central banks to step in to counter the impact.
Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Friday pledged to ""act as appropriate"" to keep the U.S. economy healthy, although he stopped short of committing to rapid-fire rate cuts.
In other corporate-relevant newsflow, German real estate stocks came under pressure after a report that Berlin's city government planned to cap rents. Deutsche Wohnen (DE:DWNG) slid 3.3%, while Vonovia (DE:VNAn) fell 2%.

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - U.S. electric vehicle maker Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) will raise prices in China on Friday, earlier than planned, and is considering increasing prices again in December should Chinese tariffs on U.S.-made cars take effect, people familiar with the matter said.
The people declined to be identified as the plan has not been made public. A Tesla representative did not immediately respond to Reuters' request for comment on Monday.
The company is among many impacted by Sino-U.S. trade friction. It currently imports all the cars it sells in China and has had to adjust prices multiple times over the past year due to tariff changes. 
Reuters reported this month that Tesla was considering to lift prices in China from September after the yuan weakened significantly against the U.S. dollar. One person told Reuters on Monday that the automaker was bringing forward these plans to Aug. 30.
Both people said the automaker is now also mulling another price hike in December after China's commerce ministry last week announced it would reinstitute tariffs of 25% on vehicles and 5% on auto parts which it suspended in December, in the latest tit-for-tat escalation of the trade war.

""Tesla will also try to ship more cars to China before December, before the tariff hikes,"" said one of the people.

Price hikes that were originally planned for September will now take place this Friday, said a Tesla sales representative in Shanghai on Monday, without disclosing details. A spokesperson for the U.S.-based electric-car maker declined to comment.
Tesla is among automakers most affected by the U.S.-China trade tensions, because it has no local production yet and therefore gets directly hit by any increases in tariffs. China threatened last week to increase duties on U.S.-made cars to as high as 50% in retaliation for President Donald Trump’s latest planned levies on Chinese goods.
A decline in the yuan, meanwhile, reduces the value of the earnings that Tesla brings back from China and converts to dollars.
Tesla is constructing a plant in China, an increasingly important market for the loss-making company as incentives for EVs in the U.S. wane. Tesla plans to start producing cars at the factory near Shanghai by the end of 2019.

1322,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 26, 2019 01:51AM ET</span>",Japan's Tepco may mothball reactors at world's biggest nuke plant,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Tokyo Electric Power (T:9501) said on Monday it may start to decommission at least one nuclear reactor at its Kashiwazaki-Kariwa power plant, the world's biggest nuclear plant by capacity, within five years of restarting two of the reactors at the site.
Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco) President Tomoaki Kobayakawa made the decommissioning comments in a statement outlining its response to a request for plans on the station's future by the government of the city of Kashiwazaki in Niigata prefecture, where the plant is located.
In 2017, Tepco received initial regulatory approval from the Japanese government to restart the No. 6 and No. 7 reactors at Kashiwazaki-Kariwa, each with a capacity of 1,356 megawatts (MW). The plant site has seven reactors with a total capacity of 8,212 MW, equal to 20% of Japan's nuclear capacity.
The facility is Tepco's last remaining nuclear plant after it announced plans to shut its Fukushima Daini station, nearby the Fukushima Daichi station where a massive earthquake and tsunami caused the meltdown of three of the site's reactors in 2011.
Kashiwazaki's Mayor Masahiro Sakurai demanded in 2017 that Tepco submit plans to shut at least one of the No. 1 to No. 5 reactors in return for approval of the restart of reactors No. 6 and No. 7, a city official told Reuters by phone on Monday.
The Kashiwazaki Mayor will take about month to evaluate Tepco's plan, the official said.
Tepco said on Friday that Kobayakawa would brief local officials on Monday about its answers to the city's request.
Tepco may take steps to decommission more than one of the No. 1 to No. 5 reactors within 5 years after the restart of the No.6 and No.7 reactors if its is confident it can secure enough non-fossil fuel energy sources, according to the statement.
A Tepco official said on Monday the company is targeting having renewable and nuclear power produce 44% of total generation by 2030.
Tepco has been trying to convince local authorities near Kashiwazaki-Kariwa, who have sign-off rights on nuclear restarts, that it has overcome operational failings revealed at Fukushima."

The  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd.-backed startup tripled revenue to 949 million yuan ($133 million) in the first half. It generated more than 73% of those sales from AI services for major clients like government agencies, hospitals and real estate developers, the company said in a filing to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.
Seven-year-old Megvii is said to be angling to raise as much as $1 billion in its initial public offering, becoming the first of China’s fast-rising AI stars to debut and beating Sensetime Group Ltd. to the punch. Its share sale however will run up against a host of uncertainties from violent pro-democracy protests that’ve gripped Hong Kong to the Trump administration’s increasingly aggressive campaign to contain China’s tech champions.
Megvii is moving forward even as other companies pump the brakes on their Hong Kong listing ambitions, wary of the turmoil. Its fundraising will further Beijing’s effort to lead the sector by 2030. That’s in turn prompting the Trump administration to sound the alarm about investment into Chinese technology.
Megvii generates the bulk of its revenue from products that combine software and sensors to help government agencies and other clients enhance public safety and optimize traffic management. Sales from that business, which it labeled “city IoT solutions,” jumped 270% to 694.8 million yuan in 2019’s first six months. Megvii said it served 112 cities in China, 38% of the country’s total, as of June. It posted 5.2 billion yuan in losses for the first half, while adjusted profit reached 32.7 million yuan.
‘IPOs‘ have been pretty disappointing in the past few months, but since AI is a hot category at the moment it could gain more traction,” said Mark Tanner, founder of Shanghai-based research and marketing company China Skinny.

The filing kicked off the formal process for an IPO, though it could be months before Megvii’s actual debut. The offering faces particular challenges. Washington has upped its rhetoric about inspection of investment into Chinese technology, which may erode the interest of U.S. money managers in the country’s AI startups.
In a list of risk factors, Megvii warned of possible economic and trade restrictions similar to curbs imposed on Huawei Technologies Co. Should that happen, it would prevent the company from procuring technology, and impair its ability to develop solutions. The company stressed that it’s made sure it’s compliant with relevant restrictions, while making contingency plans to minimize the negative impact of potential curbs.

Megvii also warned that sanctions on sales of American technology to Huawei may roil industries from consumer electronics to telecommunications. “Prolonged restrictions against Huawei could cause a turmoil to all such industries, which may in turn materially and adversely affect our business,” it said.
Megvii also sells face-scanning systems to companies from iPhone-maker Foxconn Technology Group to Lenovo Group Ltd. and Ant Financial, the payments affiliate that supports Alibaba’s e-commerce business. The company generated 207.2 million yuan from the segment it dubs “personal IoT solutions,” or 21.8% of its revenue. Its third major business line, solutions for logistics that deploy AI-empowered robots and sensors, made up some 5% of revenue.
Megvii counts Alibaba and its financial affiliate Ant Financial, Lenovo Group Ltd. and China Mobile Ltd. as strategic investors. Alibaba indirectly held 14.3% of its shares, while Ant Financial indirectly held 15.1%.

Dealmakers representing advisory firms from around the world will from Tuesday travel to Saudi Aramco’s headquarters in Dhahran in the kingdom’s Eastern Province to compete for a role on the offering that’s planned for as early as 2020, the people said, asking not to be identified as the information is private.
Aramco, which posted a profit of $46.9 billion in the first six months, has revived its much anticipated share sale after shelving plans to focus on its acquisition of a 70% stake in Saudi Basic Industries Corp. Lazard Ltd. and Moelis & Co. have restarted preparatory work and are expected to play a key role in the listing, including in the selection of underwriters and venues.
Global Invitation
The company has invited more than 20 advisory firms from the U.S., Europe and Asia to compete, including some of the world’s biggest underwriters as well as a number of smaller banks, a person familiar with the matter said last week.
A spokesman for Aramco didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. The company recently said it “continues to engage in IPO readiness activities” and is ready for a share sale that will take place “at a time of the shareholder’s choosing.”
While Aramco has yet to make a decision on a listing destination, top officials from the exchanges in London, New York and and Hong Kong have been actively pitching the oil giant in recent weeks.
The IPO project was first announced in 2016 as the cornerstone of the kingdom’s Vision 2030 plan to modernize its economy, with a target of listing in the second half of 2018. The oil producer was originally working with Evercore Inc. and Moelis, as well as  HSBC Holdings  Plc (LON:HSBA), JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co. and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS)."

Beijing-based Megvii, widely known for facial recognition platform Face++, may raise as much as $1 billion in the initial public offering, said one of the people, who expect the share sale in the fourth quarter of the year.
The filing comes as companies postpone or slow down listing plans in a recession-bound city blighted with nearly three months of anti-government protests, and where the benchmark Hang Seng share price index fell to seven-month lows this month.
Reuters reported last week that China's biggest e-commerce firm, Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, had delayed its up to $15 billion Hong Kong listing.
Megvii has decided to press ahead with its IPO plans because it has little business in Hong Kong and expects the unrest to ease later this year, said a third person.
Megvii declined to comment. The people who had direct knowledge of the matter declined to be identified as the information was not public yet.
AI LEADER
Megvii, founded in 2011 by Chief Executive Officer Yin Qi and two friends from Tsinghua University, would become the first Chinese artificial intelligence firm to go public in Hong Kong.
Its filing comes amid government plans for China to become an international leader in AI, a technology that is becoming increasingly central in various sectors.
Once the preserve of researchers, AI has grabbed the attention of businesses as varied as healthcare and financial services looking to use algorithms to comb through troves of data to recognize patterns and solve problems.
In May, Megvii raised $750 million from investors including Bank of China Group Investment Ltd (BOCGI) Ltd and Australia's Macquarie Group Ltd at a valuation of slightly over $4 billion.
The company, also backed by Ant Financial [ANTFIN.UL], provides facial recognition and other AI technology to governments and companies including Alibaba, Ant Financial, Lenovo Group Ltd and Huawei Technologies Co Ltd [HWT.UL].
It booked a loss of 3.35 billion yuan ($472 million) on revenue of 1.43 billion yuan last year, widening the loss from 759 million yuan a year earlier. Its adjusted operating profit, which excludes one-off items such as share-based compensation payments, reached 75.7 million yuan last year, showed its draft prospectus.
It will use IPO proceeds primarily for research and development, marketing and sales plus global expansion and strategic investments opportunities, the prospectus showed.
 Citigroup  (NYSE:C), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) are joint sponsors of the IPO."

Anti-government demonstrations in the city escalated over the weekend with protesters hurling Molotov cocktails at security forces who responded with water cannon and tear gas, as protests entered their third month.
""We are concerned that the ongoing political tensions in HK are now affecting the key pillars of the economy (such as retail sales, tourism, property prices) and thus the outlook of corporate earnings,"" Nomura said in a research note on Monday.
Nomura has cut its rating on MSCI's basket of Hong Kong companies to ""underweight"" from ""overweight"".
Hong Kong is bracing for its first recession since the financial crisis.
The protracted U.S.-China tariff war is also piling pressure on the trade-reliant territory, with yuan depreciation hurting the valuation of Chinese companies listed in the financial center, said Nomura.
Over the weekend, the United States added tariffs on some $550 billion of Chinese goods, hours after China unveiled retaliatory tariffs on $75 billion worth of U.S. goods.
The Chinese currency has lost 3.7% so far this month as the trade war escalated. It was down 0.6% as of midday local time."

BEIJING (Reuters) - Nissan Motor Co's (T:7201) premium brand Infiniti said it has named Taisuke Nakamura as its new design chief, replacing Karim Habib who resigned from the post.
Canadian designer Habib, who spent only about two years in the role, is the latest non-Japanese senior executive to have left Nissan in the wake of the ouster of its powerful chairman Carlos Ghosn.
Nakamura was tapped internally from Yokohama-based Nissan, whom he joined in 1993. He is currently program design director for Infiniti and has contributed to the brand’s design since 2018.
His appointment is effective September 1, according to an Infiniti statement viewed by Reuters ahead of its release. 
Nakamura is expected to report to Nissan’s global design chief, Alfonso Albaisa.
It was not immediately clear why Habib resigned. He started as Infiniti’s global design chief in July 2017, joining Nissan from BMW for which he was a global design chief.
Aside from Habib, top non-Japanese Nissan executives such as Daniele Schillaci, Jose Munoz and Trevor Mann have left the Japanese automaker in the recent past.
Ghosn, who faces charges of fraud and misconduct, is awaiting trial in Japan over charges including enriching himself at a cost of $5 million to Nissan, Japan's No. 2 automaker. 

Ghosn has denied any wrongdoing, saying he is the victim of a boardroom coup.

China’s Shanghai Composite and the Shenzhen Component were down 1.3% and 1.4% by 10:45 PM ET (02:45 GMT). 
 
Sino-U.S. trade war escalated during the weekend. On Friday, U.S. President Donald Trump announced his decision to raise existing tariffs on $250 billion worth of Chinese goods to 30% from 25% as of October. 
 
In addition, a new round of tariffs on $300 billion in goods will be taxed at 15%, up from the current 10%, he added. 
 
The move came following China’s decision to impose retaliatory tariffs on another $75 billion of U.S. goods and vowed to fight the trade war to the end.
 
Separately, two top White House officials said Trump has the authority to force American companies to leave China, while the president himself said he could declare the trade war with China as a national emergency.
 
“In many ways this is an emergency,” Trump said at the G-7 leaders meeting.
 
“I could declare a national emergency, I think when they steal and take out and intellectual property theft anywhere from $300 billion to $500 billion a year and when we have a total lost of almost a trillion dollars a year for many years,” Trump said.
 
“Actually we are getting along very well with China right now, we are talking. I think they want to make a deal much more than I do. I’m getting a lot of money in tariffs its coming in by the billions. We’ve never gotten 10 cents from China, so we will see what happens.”
 
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index plunged 3.1% as tensions flared again in the city.
 
The Hong Kong police fired a shot in the sky on Sunday night amid violent protests. The police later said it was “the best option” to disperse hundreds of protesters. Six officers had their guns drawn.
 
“Our officer’s life was in great danger,” Yolanda Yu, a police senior superintendent, said at a briefing early Monday morning. “The use of force was indeed necessary and reasonable - it was to protect any person, including the officer himself, from death or serious bodily injury.”
 
In a sign that Beijing may be losing patience, state-owned media Xinhua said Hong Kong’s protests have turned into a “Color Revolution” aimed at overturning the Special Administrative Region’s constitutional institutions
 
“It’s not only China central government’s authority but also its responsibility to intervene when riots take place in Hong Kong,” the state-run Xinhua News Agency said Sunday in a commentary.
 
Japan’s Nikkei 225 fell 1.9% even after the U.S. and Japan agreed on Sunday a trade deal under which Japan will slash tariffs on U.S. beef, pork and other agricultural products.
 
South Korea’s KOSPI and Australia’s ASX 200 were both down 1.3%. 
 
On the data front, the U.S. will releases data on GDP and durable goods this week, while China will report China industrial profits. Hong Kong retail sales and trade data are due later in the week.

1329,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 25, 2019 09:16PM ET</span>",Turnaround may prove tricky for new Virgin Australia CEO Scurrah,"By Jamie Freed
SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Shareholders will press  Virgin Australia  Holdings' new CEO Paul Scurrah to present a robust strategic plan on Wednesday, when the airline is expected to report its seventh consecutive annual loss, on top of $1.2 billion worth of red ink over the previous six years.
With shares trading near all-time lows, Scurrah's options include cutting costs, restructuring management, rebranding its underperforming budget carrier Tigerair Australia, ending loss-making flights to Hong Kong and tightening control over the loyalty division, seven current and former managers told Reuters on condition of anonymity.
But they say that because of decisions by his long-serving predecessor, John Borghetti, Scurrah may lack room to maneuver amid a weakening domestic market.
Borghetti transformed the former budget airline into a more serious rival to his former employer, Qantas Airways Ltd (AX:QAN), for lucrative corporate traffic, but in doing so he sometimes made hasty decisions that proved costly for Virgin (AX:VAH) in the long term, five of the people said.
His legacy at Australia's No. 2 carrier includes rising costs, expensive fleet and airport contracts, the sale of part of its frequent flyer business, a looming U.S. dollar debt refinancing and a complex share register and boardroom, the sources said.
""I think there were lots of decisions made that were good news up front and the cost to the business came years down the track,"" one of the sources said.
When contacted by Reuters, Borghetti declined to comment.
Major Virgin shareholders Singapore Airlines, Etihad Airways, HNA Group, Nanshan Group and Richard Branson's Virgin Group have baulked at providing more capital, the sources said, and Scurrah has told staff the airline cannot rely on shareholder financing.
Singapore Airlines, Etihad, HNA and Virgin Group declined to comment; Nanshan did not respond to a request for comment.
Virgin referred to a statement by Scurrah that airline needed to be in a position where it could better withstand financial pressures and declined to comment further.
Some strategic changes are likely to be announced on Wednesday, with others later in the year, one of the sources said.
""There is a huge amount of work going on behind the scenes at the moment in terms of looking at the entire strategy of the company,"" the source said.
Virgin declined to comment further, citing a blackout period ahead of the release of its results.
FRESH START
Scurrah, who worked in aviation early in his career but had most recently run port operator DP World's Australian business, took on the top job in late March.
Since then he has issued a profit downgrade, pushed back the delivery of  Boeing Co  (N:BA) 737 MAX planes by nearly two years to conserve capital, cut some underperforming domestic and New Zealand routes and improved staff travel benefits in an attempt to boost morale.
He has also said the airline would restructure its management team and hire a chief commercial officer and chief operating officer.
Virgin has forecast it will report an annual underlying loss on Wednesday because of weaker demand, a big turnaround from the strong half-year underlying profit Borghetti reported in February.
Under Borghetti, the airline was obsessed with reacting to Qantas rather than developing its own strategy, and divisions paid little regard to how decisions would affect one another, the current and former employees said.
Tony Webber, a former Qantas chief economist who runs an aviation research company, said Borghetti's strategy of moving upmarket to match Qantas had added too many costs relative to the revenue gains.
""The big thing is to take some costs out of the business, get them as lean as possible without massively reducing their product and go from there,"" he said of Virgin.
For Scurrah, looming decisions include whether to rebrand poorly performing budget carrier Tigerair Australia, which has struggled to recover its reputation since regulators grounded it in 2011, before it was owned by Virgin.
""It has too much baggage; that name, it has too much bad history,"" said Rico Merkert, a professor of transport at the University of Sydney Business School.
Scurrah also must decide whether to axe flights to Hong Kong launched after HNA invested in the airline. They were not lucrative even before recent anti-government protests hurt travel demand to the city, according to the sources.
CASH DRAIN
Virgin has had negative free cash flow for the last 11 financial years, according to Refinitiv data, which has led it to rely heavily on funding from equity, debt and asset sales. It has a non-investment grade credit rating because of its high debt levels.
That contrasts with Qantas, which has an investment-grade credit rating and reported A$1.24 billion of free cash flow in its annual results last week and has been regularly issuing dividends and buying back shares.
Qantas shares have risen 73% over the last three years, while Virgin shares have fallen 30% over the same period.
Virgin has a $400 million bond maturing in November. The weak Australian dollar - now at $0.67 versus $0.87 in 2014, when the debt was issued, makes for a tougher refinancing task, although it raised A$250 million in February to help prepare for the maturity. Virgin said it could not comment on refinancing plans ahead of its results.
Virgin owns 65% of its Velocity frequent flyer program but could cut that to 51% to raise cash alongside co-owner Affinity Equity Partners, which is planning to exit through an IPO or trade sale.
But the unit produces cash even when the airline business is not doing well. The current and former employees said Virgin would prefer to own all of Velocity, but it cannot easily afford to buy back Affinity's stake, which analysts estimate could be worth up to twice as much as the original A$335 million sale price.
Virgin declined to comment."

White House spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham sought on Sunday to clarify comments from Trump, saying the president wished he had raised tariffs on Chinese goods even higher last week, even as Trump signaled he did not plan to follow through with a demand he tweeted on Friday that U.S. firms find ways to close operations in China.
In early trading, the benchmark S&P 500's emini futures contract was down 1.23%. Futures tracking the Nasdaq Composite Index and Dow Jones Industrial Average were also down.

Disney said in a statement that the ""shop-in-shop"" would feature an array of more than 450 items from the company, including more than 100 products previously only available at its locations.
Disney stores will launch inside Target in major cities such as Philadelphia, Denver and Chicago. The company has stand-alone stores, but has closed its locations in West Virginia and Florida this year.
Target, in a separate announcement on Sunday, said it would open a store at Flamingo Crossings Town Center in Florida at the western entrance of the Walt Disney World Resort in 2021.
""We believe the combination of Disney's unmatched entertainment and storytelling with our omni-channel retail platform will create inspiring and unique experiences for our guests,"" Brian Cornell, chairman and chief executive officer at Target, said in a statement.
""This collaboration reflects the strength of our platforms and assets to create value for guests and growth for both companies beyond the traditional retail model,"" he added.
Guests can browse and purchase Disney store specialty merchandise from Disney, Pixar, Marvel and Star Wars, at select Target locations, the Target statement said.
The Disney store at Target will operated by the latter, with the ""shop-in-shop"" layout having an average of 750 square feet, located inside Target stores adjacent to children's clothing and toys.
The Target announcement came after the company beat expectations for earnings and raised its full-year outlook, as its investments in same-day delivery and pickup services increased traffic to its website and stores.
Led since 2014 by retail-industry veteran Cornell, Target has bounced back from a slide three years ago that saw its margins drop, prompting a rethink that has seen it remodel hundreds of stores each year.
Disney reported a steeper earnings decline than Wall Street expected, as the company poured money into its ambitious plunge into streaming media and began folding in assets purchased from Twenty-First Century Fox."
1332,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 25, 2019 04:34PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Third Point builds stake in Ray-Ban maker EssilorLuxottica - sources,"By Svea Herbst-Bayliss and Claudia Cristoferi
(Reuters) - Third Point LLC, the U.S. hedge fund that has pushed for changes at companies ranging from Nestle SA (S:NESN) to  Campbell Soup  Co (N:CPB), has amassed a stake in Ray-Ban maker EssilorLuxottica SA (PA:ESLX), people familiar with the matter said on Sunday. 
Third Point, run by billionaire investor Daniel Loeb, is targeting EssilorLuxottica amid a power struggle inside the world's largest lenses and glasses manufacturer, following its formation last year through a 48 billion euro ($53 billion) merger of France's Essilor and Italy's Luxottica.
Billed as a merger of equals, it degenerated into a battle over control between Luxottica's founder Leonardo Del Vecchio and Essilor's chief Hubert Sagnieres. The two sides announced a truce in May, but the company still faces uncertainty as it searches for a CEO that can deliver on the merger's promised annual savings of 600 million euros.
Third Point has met with Del Vecchio, who is now EssilorLuxottica's executive chairman and owns about a third of the company, according to two of the sources. Details of the meeting and on Third Point's exact stake could not be learned. 
Third Point has a track record of calling on operational improvements at companies where their stock could be buoyed by a different strategy, although is not clear what stance the New York-based hedge fund will adopt on how EssilorLuxottica should be run. Third Point is still in the process of buying EssilorLuxottica shares, one of the sources said. 
The sources requested anonymity because Third Point's investment in EssilorLuxottica is confidential. EssilorLuxottica, which has a market capitalization of 57 billion euros, and Third Point declined to comment.
A representative for Delfin, Del Vecchio's holding company, also declined to comment.
The Essilor and Luxottica camps were supposed to have equal weighting in the combined company's leadership under an agreement which expires in 2021.
Tensions surfaced last November, when Del Vecchio appeared to tap his right-hand man and Luxottica Chief Executive Francesco Milleri as the next CEO. 
The dispute came to a head in March, when Del Vecchio's Delfin said it would seek arbitration in the International Chamber of Commerce, prompting Essilor to ask a Paris court to nominate an outside mediator.
Investors, including Baillie Gifford, Comgest, Edmond de Rothschild Asset Management, Fidelity International, Guardcap, and Phitrust et Sycomore Asset Management, argued that the corporate integration was being undermined by a ""major crisis of governance."" Their effort to install independent directors on EssilorLuxottica's board failed in a shareholder vote.
In May, the two sides agreed to end their legal feud. Del Vecchio and Sagnieres made Milleri and Laurent Vacherot, EssilorLuxottica's current CEO, jointly responsible for overseeing the integration process and define strategy.
They set a deadline of finding a new CEO by the end of 2020. Milleri and Vacherot agreed not to put forward themselves for the job.
In a sign that the two camps have put some of their differences aside, EssilorLuxottica said last month it would acquire Dutch opticians group GrandVision NV (AS:GVNV) for up to 7.2 billion euros in cash. 
GrandVision, whose chains include Vision Express in Britain and For Eyes in the United States, would give EssilorLuxottica control of more than 7,000 outlets across the world where it already sells brands including Varilux lenses and Ray-Ban sunglasses. Other EssilorLuxottica brands include Oakley, Persol and Oliver Peoples.
The deal is likely to face intense scrutiny by competition regulators. The European Union only approved the merger of Essilor and Luxottica after a long study.
CHALLENGING CONGLOMERATES
Third Point, which has $15 billion in assets under management, has spent this year taking on some of the world's largest conglomerates, and has told investors that it plans to make more activist investments where it feels it has an edge. 
In June, it called on Sony Corp (T:6758) to spin off its semiconductor business and sell off stakes in Sony Financial and other units, in order to position itself as a leading global entertainment company. 
It also urged United Technologies Corp (N:UTX) to cancel its aerospace merger with U.S. defense contractor  Raytheon Co  (N:RTN), calling the deal ""ill conceived."" Earlier this month, the fund disclosed it trimmed its stake in United Technologies. 

In the first half of 2019, Third Point's flagship fund earned a 13.1% return, fueled by gains at many of its activist positions ranging from Nestle to Sony.

1337,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 25, 2019 07:46AM ET</span>",No ready spark seen for lagging U.S. energy shares,"By Lewis Krauskopf
NEW YORK (Reuters) - There may be little relief on the horizon for investors in U.S. energy companies, whose shares moved from darlings to dismal performers during Wall Street's record bull run and now face a shaky global economy, doubts about fossil fuel investments and general market skepticism.
Energy has been the worst performing of the 11 S&P 500 sectors this year, the worst performer since U.S. President Donald Trump's 2016 election and the worst performer since the U.S. bull stock market began more than a decade ago.
As a result, the S&P 500 energy sector has its lowest weight in the overall S&P 500 (SPX) since at least 1995, according to Refinitiv Datastream data. It represents under 5% of the benchmark index, down from over 15% in mid 2008, when oil prices reached historic highs at over $140 a barrel, nearly three times current levels.
But this year, the energy sector has even failed to keep pace with oil prices, despite their traditional tendency to move in the same direction.
The poor returns raised some hope that the sector will soon find a floor that would allow it to rebound, especially those stocks with appealing dividends, but that remains to be seen. 
“The view of the sector in general has gotten to a point where it's a very difficult space for institutional investors to embrace because it's been such a chronic underperformer,” said Walter Todd, chief investment officer at Greenwood Capital in South Carolina.
Since the current bull run began on March 2009, the S&P 500, which many investors view as a proxy for the stock market, has soared well over 300%, while the energy sector has climbed 32%. 
Graphic: S&P 500 vs energy sector in bull market - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/12/5168/5125/Pasted%20Image.jpg
Oil prices are up relatively little over the course of the bull market, which has largely overlapped with a U.S. economic expansion characterized by modest growth and with a boom in shale exploration that helped make the country the world's top oil producer.
This year, however, U.S. crude prices have climbed over 18% to about $54 a barrel against a 3% drop for the energy sector, although there is a wide disparity in performance among the 28 S&P 500 energy stocks. 
Graphic: Energy stock winners and losers in 2019 - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/USA-ENERGY-STOCKS/0H001QERT81D/eikon.png
“If you look over the last 18 to 24 months, the reason why this space is so frustrating is because when oil rallies, they rally but not nearly to the degree you think that they should,"" Todd said. ""But then when oil comes in, they get crushed.”
Investors have become wary of energy companies in the past out-spending their cash flows and of drilling wells without adequate returns, said Pearce Hammond, managing director at Simmons Energy in Houston.
""Basically, they were destroying capital,"" Hammond said. ""It seems like this year has been the year when investors said: 'Stop.' ""
Trump has sought to cut regulations involving energy and other natural resources companies, but the sector has still struggled during his administration.
“If you remove regulation, you are inviting more drilling which then adds supply which means lower prices,"" said Christian Ledoux, chief investment officer at South Texas Money Management in San Antonio.
Trump's tariff battle against China is raising concerns about the economy. Indeed, falling long-dated yields in the U.S. Treasury market have inverted the yield curve, a warning sign that a recession could be looming. This could particularly hit energy stocks.
“It’s an economically sensitive space and they are probably one of the largest victims of any trade war concerns,” said Burns McKinney, portfolio manager with Allianz (DE:ALVG) Global Investors in Dallas.
Energy shares underperformed on Friday as trade tensions escalated and China threatened to impose tariffs on U.S. crude oil imports for the first time.
Some investors avoid the fossil fuel industry as they worry about the companies' impact on climate change. 
""The oil and gas companies, for a lot of investors, have become a bit of a pariah,"" Hammond said.

To be sure, the energy stocks have lagged so much that some strategists and investors say they are becoming appealing.
 Citigroup  (NYSE:C) equity strategist Tobias Levkovich rates the sector ""overweight,"" noting it is at its most attractive valuation relative to the S&P 500 since 2002. But in a recent report, Levkovich conceded: ""We along with others struggle to perceive which catalysts encourage the Street to step back in to the sector, short of a major supply disruption.""
Some investors say energy shares could benefit simply from a catch-up trade with oil. 
Another factor: High dividend payout rates among some companies as U.S. Treasury yields have tumbled.  Exxon Mobil  Corp's (N:XOM) dividend yields 5%, while Occidental Petroleum Corp (N:OXY) yields 7%, compared to just a 1.54% yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note.
“If you stick to investment-grade rated companies, there’s a pretty small list of energy companies to invest in, and if you did that you’d probably be OK,” said Ledoux, whose firm's holdings include  Chevron  Corp (N:CVX).
However, Robert Pavlik, chief investment strategist at SlateStone Wealth, who is slightly underweight the sector, said he could sell energy holdings should the stocks rise to lock in profits.

""I don’t think that there is that much upside,"" Pavlik said. ""Where is oil going to go if the whole industry continues to shift (to alternative energy) as it is and we are looking at a slowdown in the economy?""

1339,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 24, 2019 06:49AM ET</span>",3 Things Under the Radar This Week,"Investing.com - Here’s a look at three things that were under the radar this week.
1. Falling RV Sales Signaling Economy About to Hit Reverse?
With doubts growing over whether the current inversions in the Treasury yield curve signal an impending recession, some have wheeled out an alternative indicator that is flashing recession: falling recreational vehicle sales.
Domestic shipments of RVs to dealers have slumped 20% in 2019, compared to the same period last year, after dropping 4% in 2018, according to the Recreational Vehicle Industry Association.
When it comes to flagging recessions, RV sales may not be the first indictor many turn to. But the measure has played a key role in helping economists gauge a key driver of the economy - the U.S. consumer.
Cyclical products like RVs tend to benefit from a favorable economic backdrop, but are usually among the first to be abandoned when economic growth is under threat. The little-known recession indictor also has history on its side.
The last three U.S. recessions have been preceded by a sharp decline in shipments, according to Michael Hicks, a Ball State University economist who tracks the industry. Manufacturing nearly two-thirds of RVs in the U.S. and shipping to dealers across the country, Elkhart, Indiana, is where economists look when gauging demand. And the impact of a slowing RV market is starting to show in Elkhart, with unemployment rising to 3% in June, up from 2.1% in April.
Like most of the current bumps in the global economy, the U.S.-China trade war has been blamed for the weakness in RV demand, pushing up vehicle prices. RV manufacturers like Thor Industries have underscored the weakness in the broader market. Its sales dropped 23% in its fiscal third quarter, with CEO Demiris Jahmal Williams describing the downturn as “the worst ever.” Retail sales of RVs this year and the next could be down mid-to-high single digits, Baird analyst Craig Kennison estimated.
2. Just a Correction?
Yield curve inversions have spooked the stock market, but investors shouldn’t look to abandon ship just yet, JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) said this week.
While it still expects a correction to stocks in August, that correction won’t be as long as the one seen this past May and tactical buyers could look for shares to pick up in September, JPMorgan said.
The bank is taking the inversion of the 10-year and 2-year Treasury yield curve into account for its equity strategy, but noted the inversion wasn’t a guaranteed signal of a recession.
“There is typically a significant lead-lag between the curve inversion and the actual market peak/ recession,” it said. “Looking at the past 6 episodes, yield curve inversion preceded recessions by as much as 17 months, on average, and the peaks of the equity market for the cycle by around 11 months.”
“Furthermore, if one were to look at what were the forward equity returns from the shape of the curve which is perfectly flat, such as current, the next 12 months’ equity performance was historically outright positive, averaging around 10%,” JPMorgan added.
3. It May Be Time for Income Stocks
After three years of Wall Street riding high-growth stocks up, particularly in the tech sector, investors may want to think about moving into income, according to Franklin Templeton.
“(D)uring recent bouts of market volatility, we’ve seen signs that many growth-focused investors may be starting to view things a bit differently,” analysts said in a note. “As U.S.-China trade frictions continue and global economic growth shows signs of slowing, the market seems to be more interested in stable companies with a proven track record of consistent dividend growth.”
They suggested three criteria for picking income stocks.
First, look for long-term performers with rising dividends, rather than high-yielding dividend stocks.
Second, find dividend growers that are leaders in their respective markets.
Third, cast a wider net, as banks have resumed paying dividends since the financial crisis and tech companies are paying income as well."

(Reuters) - Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc won a partial stay against the enforcement of a sweeping antitrust ruling in a lawsuit brought by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC), according to a court filing on Friday.
The company on May 21 lost in an antitrust lawsuit and has been fighting to have the ruling put on hold while it pursued an appeal.
The San Diego-based company argued that letting the ruling stand could upend its talks with phone makers over chips for 5G, the next generation of wireless data networks.
In the ruling issued on Friday, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals put on hold the provisions of the earlier ruling that required Qualcomm to grant patent licenses to rival chip suppliers and end its practice of requiring its chip customers to sign a patent license before purchasing chips.
The earlier ruling would have required Qualcomm to renegotiate all of its existing chip and patent deals, as well as make new deals conform to the requirements. The stay granted Friday puts on hold the effect of parts of the ruling while the appeals process, which could take a year or more, plays out.
The Qualcomm antitrust case was unique in that different parts of the U.S. government weighed in with differing views. The Department of Justice - the other primary antitrust regulator in the United States - said during the initial trial that it disagreed with the FTC's legal theory. And after the trial judge handed down a decision, the Pentagon and the Department of Energy both made filings saying that enforcing the decision would harm national security.
""The government itself is divided about the propriety of the judgment and its impact on the public interest,"" the appeals court wrote in its ruling. 
Shares rose briefly after the news but then dropped 3.7% to $74.29 in afternoon trading on the Nasdaq. Shares have been volatile this year, rising from the mid-$50 range to above $85 after Qualcomm settled a major lawsuit with Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), but then dropping to the mid-$60 range after its loss of the case brought by the FTC.
The company has not formally filed its appeal in the FTC lawsuit. After Qualcomm files its arguments, the appeal will take place in January.

In a statement, Qualcomm general counsel Don Rosenberg said the company believes ""the district court decision will be overturned once the merits of our appeal have been considered.”

1341,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 23, 2019 06:41PM ET</span>","U.S. Steel to idle Indiana plant, 150 jobs at risk","CHICAGO (Reuters) - U.S. Steel said on Friday it will idle a plant in Indiana by mid-November as part of the consolidation of its till mill operations in the United States, a move which could result in lay-offs for nearly 150 employees.
The news comes days after the Pittsburgh-based company revealed its plans to let go of up to 200 workers at its Great Lakes facility in Michigan.
The steelmaker blamed high levels of low-priced imports for its decision to consolidate work at East Chicago Tin facility into the ones at Gary Works and the Midwest Plant in Northwest Indiana.
The East Chicago facility currently employs 297 workers. A U.S. Steel spokeswoman said the company expects to offer half of the employees positions at the two Northwest Indiana plants.
""Decisions around employee impacts have not been finalized,"" Meghan Cox, the company's spokeswoman, told Reuters. ""Our goal is to place as many East Chicago Tin employees as possible at other nearby U. S. Steel facilities.""
U.S. Steel's shares closed down 5.3% at $11.17 on Friday. Its stock price has plunged 76% since March 1, 2018, when President Donald Trump announced his decision to impose 25% tariffs on foreign steel imports to help revive U.S. steelmakers."
1342,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 23, 2019 06:14PM ET</span>",Wall Street Weekahead: Investors look at dollar stores as U.S. recession fears increase,"By David Randall
NEW YORK (Reuters) - More investors are watching the shares of discount retailers like  Dollar General Corp  (N:DG) and  Dollar Tree Inc  (O:DLTR), which perform better during economic downturns, in the hopes of gauging changes in consumer behavior, though higher tariffs may erode the companies' ability to act as economic bellwethers.
Fund managers and analysts say that they are looking for signs of a so-called ""trade-down trade"", in which consumers forgo shopping at higher-end department stores or supermarkets in favor of the more limited selection but lower prices at deep discounters. Between December 2008 and December 2011, for instance, shares of Dollar Tree soared nearly 200% as consumers pinched pennies during the Great Recession, while the benchmark S&P 500 gained just 39% over the same time. 
For the year to date, shares of Dollar Tree are up 7.3% as it integrates its purchase of former competitor Family Dollar, while shares of Dollar General are up 28.4%. Both companies are scheduled to report earnings Aug. 29.
""The good news is consumers often shop more at the dollar stores during periods of economic weakness.  We wouldn't expect a sharp increase in sales, but we suspect sales will remain stable at the dollar stores while other companies may feel greater pain,"" said Mark DeVaul, a portfolio manager at the Hennessy Equity and Income fund, who has a position in Dollar Tree. 
""We believe the treasure hunt shopping atmosphere will continue to drive traffic and somewhat insulate them from competition from Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).""
There are no indications that the United States is currently in a recession, though investors are becoming increasingly worried that the longest economic expansion in U.S. history is nearing its end. 
Earlier this month, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) said that the likelihood that the trade war between the U.S. and China leads to a recession are increasing and that it no longer expects a trade deal between the world's two largest economies before the 2020 U.S. presidential election. 
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), meanwhile, forecast that if the United States increases tariffs on all imports from China to 25 percent for 4-6 months, and China takes countermeasures, a U.S. recession would follow in three quarters.
The spread between the yields of shorter- and longer-duration Treasury bonds slipped below zero earlier this year, a so-called yield curve inversion which has presaged recessions in the past. The yield of 30-year Treasuries hit record lows last week, a sign that investors are betting on slower economic growth and low inflation. 
A trade-down trade in the face of economic weakness could also benefit deep discount retailers such as  Five Below Inc  (O:FIVE),  National Vision  Holdings Inc (O:EYE), and Ollie's Bargain Outlet Holdings Inc (O:OLLI) that have solid balance sheets, noted Anthony Chukumba, managing director at Loop Capital Markets. Higher-end retailers like  Best Buy  Co Inc (N:BBY), meanwhile, would likely underperform, he said.
""With the likelihood of a recession creeping up, we believe investors should start paying more attention to specialty hardlines retailers’ capital structures,"" he said. 
Dollar General, in particular, may continue to outperform due to its strong management team and inventory control, said Charles Grom, an analyst at Gordon Haskett Research Advisors.
""This is one of our best ideas and we think there's an above-average chance that they will be raising their guidance"" when the company reports its results and ""mirror what  Target  did"", he said. Shares of Target Corp (N:TGT) jumped over 19% and hit record highs after the company posted better-than-expected sales growth on Tuesday.
Yet deep discounters like Dollar Tree and Dollar General are not immune from the economic impacts of the trade war between the U.S. and China. Dollar Tree, for example, imports an estimated 60% of its inventory from China and could be forced into raising prices if it is no longer able to get concessions from its vendors, said DeVaul, the Hennessy fund manager. 

""They may have to 'break the buck' and raise prices, but the risk there is that by doing so they could piss off a lot of people and not get them back,"" he said.

1343,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 23, 2019 05:38PM ET</span>","Answering Trump, UPS, FedEx and USPS say they already fight illegal drug shipments","By Lisa Baertlein and Ankit Ajmera
(Reuters) - FedEx Corp (N:FDX),  United Parcel  Service Inc (N:UPS) and the U.S. Postal Service said on Friday they are already working to stop traffickers from using their services after U.S. President Donald Trump ordered delivery firms to refuse packages of the powerful painkiller fentanyl from China.
Trump told those shippers and online retailer Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) to decline deliveries of the synthetic opioid from China, which on Friday announced new retaliatory tariffs on a swath of U.S. goods. 
""I am ordering all carriers, including Fed Ex, Amazon, UPS and the Post Office, to SEARCH FOR & REFUSE all deliveries of Fentanyl from China (or anywhere else!),"" Trump said on Twitter.
""President Xi said this would stop - it didn’t,"" he tweeted, referring to China's President Xi Jinping. 
Fentanyl is 50 times more powerful than heroin and is contributing to the nation's deadliest drug crisis in history.
Shares of FedEx, UPS and Amazon were each down at least 3% after the latest salvo in the U.S.-China trade war sent the U.S. stock market lower.
""We work closely with all law enforcement and regulatory authorities to monitor for prohibited substances,"" UPS said. 
Rival FedEx said in a statement it ""already has extensive security measures in place to prevent the use of our networks for illegal purposes."" 
Private delivery companies like UPS and FedEx electronically track packages, which has deterred some drug dealers, who have exploited the gaps in the USPS' tracking system.
""The most common distribution medium is via the U.S. Postal Service,"" the U.S. Treasury said in a statement on Wednesday, when it announced sanctions against a trio of Chinese nationals accused of trafficking illegal fentanyl.
Drug traffickers target U.S. ports of entry and international mail centers, where parcel and vehicle inspections are limited due to staffing shortages and other constraints, experts and officials said. 
""The U.S. Postal Service is aggressively working to implement provisions of the STOP Act to keep dangerous drugs from entering the United States from China and other countries,"" USPS said in a statement, referring to Synthetics Trafficking and Overdose Prevention Act enacted by U.S. Congress in 2018. 
That legislation required the Postal Service to receive advance electronic data (AED) - including the names and addresses of senders and recipients, package contents and other information - on all shipments from China by the end of 2018 and from all countries by the end of 2020. 
China's STOP compliance has lagged and the USPS and U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) have informed China's postal operator any U.S.-bound shipment without AED may be returned at any time, the postal carrier said. 
Meanwhile, USPS and its law enforcement arm, the Postal Inspection Service, continue to work with government and law enforcement agencies to combat the trafficking of illicit drugs like fentanyl, USPS said. 

Amazon did not reply to a request for comment.

The S&P 500 fell 2.59%. The Dow was off nearly 2.37%, and the Nasdaq Composite was down 3.0%. The Nasdaq 100, heavily influenced by some of the biggest names in technology, dropped about 3.15%.
 The losses were the third worst point loss for the S&P 500 this year and the fourth-worst daily point losses for the Dow and the Nasdaq.
The three big S&P 500 losses have occurred in August.
The Dow, meanwhile, had fallen as many as 745 points during the session before last-minute bargain hunting trimmed the day's losses.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), whose growth is tied to growth in its China business, was off more than 4.6%. Most big-tech stocks were off by similar amounts. Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) fell about 7.4%. Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), whose chips speed up graphics applications, fell 5.3%.
The Trump order, announced on Twitter and whose enforceability is questionable, came after China announced it would raise tariffs on a variety of U.S. products, including cars and farm products. The president said U.S. manufacturers should move their Chinese operations elsewhere or bring jobs back to the United States.
After the close, President Trump retaliated against China's tariff move, saying he's raising tariffs to 30% on some Chinese imports after Beijing said it would place added tariffs on U.S. goods. It wasn't clear how the move will affect markets on Monday.
The order also came after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell told a Jackson Hole, Wyo., conference that the Fed stood ready to provide stimulus to the economy if needed. Trump didn't like the speech because it did not signal an aggressive interest-rate cut at the Fed's next meeting in September.
In a tweet, Trump asked, ""My only question is, who is our biggest enemy, Jay Powell or Chairman Xi?” Chairman Xi being Xi Jinping, the Chinese president.

(Reuters) - The two new top executives at Citgo Petroleum PDVSAC.UL disclosed this week that net income in the second quarter slid to less than half its level a year earlier, hit by a broad slump for the refining industry as well as complications from U.S. sanctions on Venezuela and Citgo's split with state-run oil company PDVSA.
Chief Executive Officer Carlos Jorda and Chairwoman Luisa Palacios on Thursday laid out a plan to rebuild profits, pay down debt and invest in operations after a jarring split this year from parent Petroleos de Venezuela (PDVSA). But they will have to work hard to deal with U.S. sanctions on Venezuela, which have affected relationships with suppliers and partners.
One contentious issue is whether Citgo or another PDVSA subsidiary is responsible for a payment of almost $1 billion due to bondholders this fall.
Houston-based Citgo, the eighth-largest U.S. refiner, ousted its CEO and other top executives early this year and halted all dealings with PDVSA after Washington levied sanctions on Venezuela intended to force socialist President Nicolas Maduro from office.
In his first public remarks since becoming Citgo CEO last week, Jorda revealed that Citgo's net income tumbled to $122 million in the second quarter from $255 million a year earlier, mainly due to a lengthy turnaround at its Corpus Christi, Texas refinery. Weak margins also contributed to the result.
On top of that, U.S. sanctions have disrupted longstanding business relationships for Citgo, deprived the company of Venezuelan oil contracts and required it to find alternatives.
Jorda forecast that profits will rebound as margins are boosted by growing demand for low-sulfur fuels and as refineries run a wider variety of crude grades because they can no longer use Venezuelan supplies.
One thing Citgo might not soon be able to do is resume dividend payments to parent companies, which in some cases are controlled by Venezuela's opposition congress.
Securing ""operational and financial stability"" is one of the company's three new main goals, according to the executives. Further reducing debt, after the company refinanced $1.87 billion, is key for freeing Citgo from debt covenants currently stopping it from paying dividends, according to analysts.
""The board of directors has been working on the company's operational and financial strength so it can recover its capacity to declare dividends to the shareholder,"" Palacios told Reuters.
Some Venezuelan politicians were expecting Citgo, as the country's largest foreign asset, to help finance congress chief Juan Guaido's interim government. The United States and dozens of other Western countries recognized Guaido as Venezuela's legitimate leader even as Maduro retains control of PDVSA and the nation's military.
Guaido in February appointed new directors to oversee Citgo and PDVSA's other foreign subsidiaries. Last week, a Delaware court confirmed the Citgo board, rejecting a move by Maduro to regain control of its U.S. operations. Citgo last year reported net income of $851 million on revenue of nearly $30 billion.
Jorda pledged the business will perform better in the second half. Despite having to transition to new oil suppliers, ""the operation has been good,"" he said. Citgo refineries in Louisiana and Texas, geared to run heavy crude, are now processing more U.S. domestic light grades, while its Illinois refinery continues running Canadian oil.
""The whole U.S. refining industry is having a bad time now,"" said a portfolio manager who follows Citgo debt. ""But it's also true that Citgo now even has an excess of liquidity.""
Citgo also faces legal challenges from Venezuela creditors, and from U.S. investigations into the company's role in PDVSA contracts. The payment of about $900 million payment due to PDVSA bondholders in October is secured by Citgo shares.
""That's not Citgo's debt, but PDVSA's,"" Palacios said when asked if the firm would be involved in the payment. She added that Guaido's team is pursuing negotiations with bondholders. ""We trust they will succeed,"" she said.
U.S. sanctions that bar imports of Venezuelan oil also weigh on the business. Citgo, which processes about 750,000 barrels of oil per day, turned to open-market purchases of mostly U.S., Latin American and Canadian crudes for its refineries.
Smaller discounts for some heavy crudes are also affecting refiners across the Gulf, Jorda said. But he forecast discounts for heavy oil would widen to about $7.65 per barrel in the second half, aiding margins. No refinery expansions are planned, he said."

The S&P 500 fell nearly 2%. The Dow Jones industrials were off about 1.9%, and the NASDAQ Composite was down 2.53%. The Nasdaq 100 Index, heavily influenced by some of the biggest names in technology, had dropped 2.74%.
The Dow had fallen as many as 589 points on the news before trimming some of its losses to 504 points.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), whose growth is tied to growth in its China business, was off nearly 4% and was the weakest Dow stock and eleventh-worst Nasdaq-100 performer. Hasbro (NASDAQ:HAS), Alexion Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:ALXN) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) were the hardest-hit Nasdaq-100 stocks.
Boeing (NYSE:BA)was the lone Dow winner on the day. NetEase (NASDAQ:NTES) and   Intuit   (NASDAQ:INTU) were the sole Nasdaq gainers.
The Trump order, announced on Twitter and whose enforceability is likely questionable, came after China announced it would raise tariffs on a variety of U.S. products, including cars and farm products. He suggested U.S. manufacturers bring jobs back to the United States.
The order also came after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell told a Jackson Hole, Wyo., conference Friday that the Fed stood ready to provide stimulus to the economy if needed. Trump didn't like the speech because it did not signal an aggressive interest-rate cut ahead and, in a tweet asked, ""My only question is, who is our biggest enemy, Jay Powell or Chairman Xi?” Chairman Xi is Chinese president Xi Jinping.

1357,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 23, 2019 03:51PM ET</span>",On-off trade tariffs wreak havoc on U.S. company planning,"By Rajesh Kumar Singh
CHICAGO (Reuters) - Win Cramer thought his company was out of the firing line in the escalating Sino-U.S. trade war after his ""Made-in-China"" wireless headphones, speakers and earbuds were taken off Washington's tariff list a year ago.
Little did the JLab Audio chief executive know that nine months later those products would again be targeted, posing an even greater risk to his California-based company.
Earlier this month, U.S. President Donald Trump unexpectedly put off new 10% tariffs on about half of $300 billion of targeted Chinese imports until Dec. 15. But JLab's shipments will be subjected to the tariffs starting Sept. 1.
Trump's push to rewrite global trade rules has upended supply chains and inflated costs for many U.S. companies. His tariff threats, also aimed at forcing American companies to move operations back home, have complicated planning for those with suppliers or manufacturing in China.
On Friday, Trump in a tweet ""ordered"" U.S. companies to exit China after Beijing unveiled retaliatory tariffs on $75 billion in U.S. goods, throwing a new twist into the bitter trade war between the world's two largest economies.
After the tariff reprieve in August 2018, JLab poured $1 million into new product development and spent another $500,000 to expand its U.S. workforce by 20%. The investment, one of the biggest for the mid-sized company that was founded in 2005, is now at risk.
""We invested because we felt confident tariffs would not be put back on these products,"" Cramer said in an interview. ""Perhaps, it would have been better if, last year, they hadn't removed us from the tariff list.""
The $550 billion U.S. chemical industry is also finding itself in a pickle after 111 products that it imports from China are on the latest tariff list. They had been exempted in August 2018 on grounds that they were essential for U.S. manufacturing and agriculture.
The about-turn has frustrated chemical manufacturers, said Ed Brzytwa, a director at the American Chemical Council (ACC). ""There is no explanation from the administration why they flip-flop like this. It is very confusing to us.""
Chemical manufacturers are spending copious resources dealing with tariffs rather than on product innovation and research and development, Brzytwa said, adding that some companies have had to cut travel budgets.
An official at the office of U.S. Trade Representative declined to comment beyond saying that the products, covered in the latest round of tariffs, were not included in the previous duty increases.
SITTING TIGHT
With no end seen to the trade war, companies are going slow on new spending until future U.S. trade policy becomes clearer.
Business investment shrank in the second quarter for the first time since 2016, Commerce Department data showed. U.S. business confidence has sunk to the lowest in nearly three years, according to a OECD survey.
""We need to get a trade deal resolved to get some confidence back in this market,"" Dow Inc (N:DOW) CEO James Fitterling told investors recently. Until then, the chemical producer will keep capital spending ""tight,"" he noted.
 Caterpillar  Inc (N:CAT) said last month its customers had turned cautious about making large capital expenditures.
JLab has canceled hiring plans for the United States.
Cramer is meeting with retailers such as  Best Buy  (N:BBY),  Target  Corp (N:TGT) and Walmart Inc (N:WMT), imploring them to accept tariff-induced price hikes for his products. Similar talks in 2018 were suspended after JLab's products got a reprieve.
Since price increases alone will not fully offset the tariffs, JLab is reviewing all options to cut costs - from coffee suppliers and cleaners to marketing and advertising plans - for the second half of the year.
INVEST OVERSEAS
To reduce its reliance on China, JLab will start production in Vietnam in January. But with the Trump administration's focus on correcting trade imbalances, Cramer worries that the Southeast Asian nation could be next in the line of fire.
U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer last month warned Hanoi over the ""unsustainable"" bilateral trade gap.
The U.S. trade deficit with Vietnam was $39.5 billion in 2018 and is expected to widen further as many American companies move production into the country to avoid the trade war with China.
JLab also has fast-tracked plans to expand overseas. Sales abroad currently account for 10% of its revenues.
""As things stand today, we are not hiring in the U.S. anymore,"" Cramer said. ""But I am hiring overseas and creating jobs in Europe, APAC and China because I feel confident that those markets will provide us some stability.""
Brzytwa of ACC said some of chemical producers are reviewing their U.S. investment plans and are considering moving production overseas.
The United States has a large and growing trade surplus in industrial chemicals. The industry's exports were $140 billion in 2018, accounting for 10% of all U.S. goods exports.
To grow, Brzytwa says, U.S. chemical makers need China, which is not just their third-largest exports market, but also a vital source for many inputs.
""We are worried about our market access closing in other parts of the world,"" he said.
POLICY BY TWEET
Apart from the flip-flop on tariffs, companies are troubled by how the administration conducts and communicates trade policy.
Frequent twists and turns are forcing companies adapt and re-adapt at frequent intervals. Trump's penchant for announcing his decisions on Twitter also leaves them little time to prepare for changes.
Cramer and other company heads said they have little choice but to keep monitoring Trump's tweets to find out the latest news on trade relations with China.
In May, Cramer was getting ready to start the hiring process for three new employees in his California and Texas offices when he learned via Trump's tweets that the trade talks with China had broken down and a new round of tariffs was in the offing. After the administration put his products on the tariff list, the hiring process was put on hold.
He revived the process when Trump in late June declared a truce with China. But as he began interviewing job candidates, Trump tweeted on Aug. 1 that the tariffs were back in play.
If all else fails, Cramer may have to consider layoffs but the fluid U.S. trade policy makes it tough to decide.
""I am not motivated to just let people go on a whim, knowing that a tweet on Tuesday can come out and say 'you are fine, don't worry about it',"" Cramer said. ""It is outrageous."""

Footlocker reported earnings of 66 cents per share on revenue of $1.774 billion, missing consensus estimates from Investing.com for earnings of 67 cents a share on revenue of $1.82 billion, sending shares sliding than 17%.
Same-store sales grew 0.8%, well below expectations for a 3.2% gain, while gross profit margins fell to 30.1% from 30.2%.
The results were at the lower end of management’s expectations, but the company said it was well positioned for the back-to-school period on beyond.
""While results in the second quarter did come in at the low end of our estimates, we saw improvement in our performance as we moved through each month of the quarter,"" said Chief Executive Richard Johnson. 
""We remain deeply committed with sneaker and youth culture, and believe this positive momentum exiting the quarter has us well prepared for the back-to-school period and beyond."" 
The company opened 10 new stores in the quarter, remodeled or relocated 35 other locations, and closed 37 stores. It had 3,174 stores in 27 countries at the end of the period.
While the company says it's confident about its prospects, investors are clearly skepitcal -- and not just Friday. The shares are headed for a weekly loss of about 12.7%. They're off about 16% so far in August and 35% on the year."

1367,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 23, 2019 02:14PM ET</span>",Stocks - Wall Street Shrugs After Powell's Speech,"Investing.com - U.S. stocks traded lower Friday after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell reiterated that the central bank will act “as appropriate” to sustain the economy, in a speech that also blamed trade policy for much of the global economic slowdown.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 33 points, or 0.1%, by 10:30 AM ET (14:30 GMT), while the S&P 500 was off 6 points, or 0.2%, and the Nasdaq 100 was down 25 points ,or 0.3%.
Stocks had already opened lower, reeling from China’s announcement of import tariffs on some $75 billion of U.S. imports, including new levies on crude oil and autos.
After a brief bounce, as Powell’s headlines hit the wires, they resumed their declines as the speech failed to flesh out any promises for monetary stimulus beyond what Powell had already said in recent public appearances.
If anything, the speech represented some pushback against pressure from President Donald Trump, who has repeatedly insulted Powell and the Fed over Twitter and called for a 100-basis-point cut in its interest rates.
At three separate points in his speech, Powell referred to the problems for the central bank by trade policy, in what appeared to be an implicit critique of Trump’s approach to the U.S.-China relationship.
“While monetary policy is a powerful tool that works to support consumer spending, business investment, and public confidence, it cannot provide a settled rulebook for international trade,” Powell said, adding that there are “no recent precedents to guide any policy response to the current situation.”
Powell also noted that the U.S. economy is still looking strong, despite increased risks to the global outlook.
“Job creation has slowed from last year's pace but is still above overall labor force growth. Inflation seems to be moving up closer to 2 percent,” he said. “Based on our assessment of the implications of these developments, we will act as appropriate to sustain the expansion, with a strong labor market and inflation near its symmetric 2 percent objective.”
Among the most active stocks Friday,   Foot Locker   (NYSE:FL) fell 12% after its quarterly update failed to match the strength of other retail reports this week. Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) rose 5.7% after its quarterly results showed new acquisitions contributing to a healthy 22% rise in revenues, while Boeing (NYSE:BA) rose 3.1% on the back of reports that the Federal Aviation Agency is getting closer to letting the troubled 737 Max fly again.
Trade-sensitive semiconductor stocks were broadly lower, as was Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), which lost 0.9%.
Crude oil futures, however, recovered some of the losses they made on the back of the Chinese news to trade at $54.22 a barrel, a loss of 2.0% on the day. Haven assets made broad but unspectacular gains: gold futures gained nearly 1% to $1,523.15 a troy ounce. The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of currencies, gave up 0.1% on the back of the speech, mainly due to losses against the yen and Swiss franc."

Last month, the pilots overwhelmingly voted for industrial action and the airline, which is part of IAG (L:ICAG), failed in a court bid to stop them.
""The British Airline Pilots Association (BALPA) has today given notice to British Airways that it will call on its members to strike on 9th, 10th and 27th September 2019,"" the union said in a statement. 
""It is clear, following discussions with members over the last few days, that BA's most recent offer will not gain the support of anywhere near a majority of its pilots.""
British Airways said the strike action was unjustifiable as their pay offer was fair and that the strikes would destroy the travel plans of tens of thousands of customers.
""We are now making changes to our schedule. We will do everything we can to get as many people away on their journeys as possible,"" the airline said in a statement. 
""However, it is likely that many of our customers will not be able to travel and we will be offering refunds and re-bookings for passengers booked on canceled flights.""

The airline said it was exploring options to supplement its fleet with aircraft and crew from other airlines, known as wet-leasing, and working with partner airlines to schedule larger aircraft to take more customers.

Ryanair told staff last month it planned to cut its presence on the ground at airports due to delays in the delivery of the grounded Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX, that has left it with 900 more pilots and crew than it needs.
The airline's chief people officer told Reuters last week that it would likely close its base in the Portuguese city of Faro and two on the Canary Islands but that a final decision had yet to be made on how many bases, jobs and routes would go.
Ryanair confirmed the closures to the USO union in an email on Friday and also announced the opening of a collective dismissal process, the union said in a statement.
It said 512 workers could be affected by the decision at the four airports, three of which are based in Spain's Canary Islands and the other on the mainland.

1382,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 23, 2019 11:31AM ET</span>","Worldpay charges, disclosed in fine print, anger small U.S. merchants","By David Henry
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Mark VenHuizen, the comptroller of a family business which sells parts for boat engines in Florida, says he has complained three times to Worldpay Inc since 2016 for tacking on extra fees to process his customers' credit and debit card payments without clearly telling him about it.
The first two times when he complained after noticing larger costs on his billing statement, the additional fees disappeared for a few months. Last August, he discovered Worldpay had added a 0.3% charge on top of an initial fee of 0.2% on many transactions, boosting his bill by hundreds of dollars.
""It has been so frustrating with them,"" VenHuizen said.
In the course of several interviews and email exchanges over the past two months, Worldpay told Reuters it had notified VenHuizen in his June 2018 statement that fees for many transactions would increase by up to 0.8%. That happened for transactions such as when his customers made payments using cards that offer spending rewards like cashback and travel points. The company also referred to VenHuizen's original agreement, where in fine print it says it may charge up to 1.95% for those types of transactions.
It said such markups are tied to risks and costs associated with individual businesses and depend on factors such as the type of merchant, how often it takes cards online, and whether the cards tend to have high credit limits.
""Worldpay's fees are properly disclosed,"" the company said.
Payment processors like Worldpay are a key part of the plumbing for everyday non-cash transactions such as credit and debit card swipes at grocery stores and restaurants. They gather transaction information and send it through the card networks such as Visa (NYSE:V) and Mastercard (NYSE:MA) to the card issuers, which are typically banks. They also take on some risk as they vouch to card companies for the merchants' ability to cover refunds on bad charges.
Processors were paid about $20 billion for their work in 2018, according to industry publication The Nilson Report.
Worldpay, the largest U.S. processor by transaction volume, was bought by Fidelity National Information Services Inc for $50 billion in a deal that closed on July 31.
In a statement sent this week to Reuters for this story, FIS said, ""As part of the integration activities for our recent acquisition of Worldpay, we are currently reviewing Worldpay's sales and billing practices to ensure they are fair and transparent.""
The company added, ""We take any concern over unfair practices very seriously.""
Interviews with three merchants, several competitors and five former Worldpay salespeople, as well as a review of billing statements sent to more than a dozen merchants, show that Worldpay tells merchants upfront that it will collect two different kinds of fees on card transactions. Those are a fee for its own services, and charges levied by the card networks and issuers that it collects and passes on.
In fact, the processor adds a third fee for some small merchants that is disclosed in the fine print - a markup to the card network and issuer charges, these people said. In its billing statements, it mixes that markup with the card company charges and does not show the specific amount it has added, according to the people and the documents.
As a result, when small U.S. businesses, such as VenHuizen's company, Jerry's Marine Service, sign up with Worldpay, they at times end up paying hundreds of dollars more for the service than they realize, the billing statements show.
""It is very confusing to try to interpret one of these billing statements,"" said Anthony Barnett, who owns two restaurants in the U.S. Northeast. ""It is all in the fine print.""
Barnett said he switched processors earlier this year after Worldpay added a 0.65% markup to his statements for one restaurant and then offered to reduce his charges by roughly $2,700 a month when he complained.
Worldpay said it had not increased its rates for Barnett's restaurant ""in nearly two years."" 
SALES PRACTICES
In contrast to Worldpay, JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co's payment processing unit, for example, said it separately discloses card company costs and its fees in statements to merchants in plans that compare with Worldpay's.  Square Inc  (NYSE:SQ) offers flat rates that cover all charges.
Worldpay, which commented to Reuters before its sale to FIS closed, said that its statements and pricing were not ""significantly different than industry practices.""
Worldpay declined to provide the number, or proportion, of its merchant customers who are assessed a markup. Nor would it quantify the additional revenue it brings.
Nearly 200,000 merchants were allegedly overcharged by the company for such markups or other extra fees, according to court documents filed in 2017 when Worldpay settled a lawsuit. The suit was brought by class action lawyers representing merchants who claimed the company had misled them.
Worldpay settled the lawsuit for $52 million. ""While we believe we had meritorious defenses to the claims, we settled the matter two years ago to avoid potentially protracted and costly litigation,"" the company told Reuters.
FIS said it was engaging a third party as part of its review of Worldpay's practices. ""We are committed to ensuring that any historic issues are addressed going forward,"" it said.
Sales practices of the payments industry fall under the purview of the Federal Trade Commission, which is charged with preventing ""unfair or deceptive acts or practices"" in commerce. Two former agency lawyers said the agency expects consistent language in marketing and sales agreements.
But the FTC has brought only a handful of cases against processors over the past two decades, leaving practices largely unchallenged.
An FTC spokesman declined to comment.
DIFFERENT MARKUPS
Reuters reviewed monthly Worldpay billing statements with markups issued to more than a dozen small merchants between January 2018 and April 2019. Some were provided directly to Reuters by the merchants and others came through industry sources.
Those businesses were paying markups of at least 0.2% on many credit card transactions. A vitamin shop in Colorado was paying an extra 0.95% on many of its transactions. A dentist in Illinois was paying 1.85% more but a dentist in Alabama was being marked up 0.65%.
For each type of transaction, it took five calculations, including a reference to rates from complex card industry tables, to figure out how much the merchants were being charged extra.
""There is no way for a merchant to know what they are going to pay,"" said Ben Dwyer, who writes about the industry and makes money selling processing services for selected Worldpay competitors.
In VenHuizen's case, Worldpay removed information showing card company charges when it added its markup. In his July 2018 statement, the company had shown specific rates for what it was collecting on behalf of card companies. When Worldpay added its markups in August 2018, the rate disclosures disappeared from his statement.
Worldpay said it notified VenHuizen in advance and its charges were proper.
The five former salespeople, who worked at Worldpay until 2017, said they did not tell customers about the possibility of extra fees when they signed them up, in part because they had an incentive to close on sales quickly. Salespeople were expected to sign 60 to 80 new merchants each month, three of the sources said, and lower fees helped do that. 
Worldpay told Reuters it does not offer low introductory rates to win customers.
Worldpay used pricing tables to include about 20 different levels of markups, three of the former salespeople said. The tables added markups in increments of 0.05% to 0.10% and topped out at an extra 1.85%, the three sources said.

Some customers, including ones who licensed sales software from important Worldpay business partners, were exempt from markups, two of the former salespeople said.

LONDON (Reuters) - A South African high court judge on Friday refused Zambia's state mining company ZCCM leave to appeal a previous ruling halting the sale of Vedanta Resources' (NS:VDAN) majority-owned Konkola Copper Mines (KCM) pending arbitration.
Vedanta has been locked in a dispute with the Zambian government since May, when Lusaka appointed a liquidator to run KCM, which is 20% owned by ZCCM and the rest by Vedanta.
Zambia had accused KCM of breaching the terms of its license, which Mumbai-listed Vedanta denies.
In July, a South African judge said wind-up proceedings must be immediately withdrawn until a final decision is made following arbitration. Zambia appealed and said it was proceeding with the liquidation.
Judge Leicester Adams said his main reasons for refusing leave to appeal were that ZCCM had raised nothing new and that leave would only be granted when a judge believed it could succeed.
The South African high court is recognized as a court in the context of the International Arbitration Act.
""There are no reasonable prospects of another court coming to different conclusions, be they on aspects of facts or law, to the ones reached by me. The appeal does not, in my judgement, have a reasonable prospect of success,"" the judge said in his ruling.
Vedanta said it remained committed to engaging with the Zambian government to find an amicable solution.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Thousands of chanting Hong Kong protesters joined peaceful ""Baltic Chain"" links of hands on Friday, with almost three months of anti-government demonstrations showing no sign of let-up across the Chinese-ruled territory.
Demonstrators, some masked, some using hand wipes to stay clean, linked hands across different districts as others held up banners thanking overseas nations for supporting ""freedom and democracy"" in Hong Kong.
In 1989, an estimated two million people joined arms across three Baltic states in a protest against Soviet rule that became known as the ""Baltic Way"" or ""Baltic Chain"".
""I joined the Hong Kong Way because it’s peaceful,"" said protester Peter Cheung, 27. ""This is the 30th anniversary of the Baltic Way. I hope there will be a bigger chance to make an international noise.""
The protests, triggered by a now-suspended bill that would have allowed extraditions to China, have plunged the former British colony into its worst crisis since its return to China in 1997 and pose a major challenge for Communist Party rulers in Beijing.
The unrest has widened into calls for greater freedom, fueled by worries about the erosion of rights guaranteed under a ""one country, two systems"" formula, adopted after the 1997 handover, such as an independent judiciary and the right to protest.
Protesters are also planning a ""stress test"" of the airport this weekend.
The airport, reached by a gleaming suspension bridge carrying both rail and road traffic, was forced to close last week when protesters, barricading passageways with luggage trolleys, metal barriers and other objects, clashed with police.
China's Hong Kong affairs office condemned the mayhem as ""near-terrorist acts"".
""Go to the airport by different means, including MTR, airport bus, taxi, bike and private car to increase pressure on airport transport,"" protest organizers wrote online on Friday.
The Airport Authority published a half-page notice in newspapers urging young people to ""love Hong Kong"" and said it opposed acts that blocked the airport, adding that it would keep working to maintain smooth operations.
Hong Kong's high court extended an order restricting protests at the airport. Some activists had apologized for last week's airport turmoil.
The Canadian consulate said it had suspended travel to mainland China for local staff, just days after a Chinese employee of the city's British consulate was confirmed to have been detained in China.
Beijing has said that Simon Cheng, the consulate employee, was detained in the border city of Shenzhen neighboring Hong Kong. It has accused Britain and other Western countries of meddling in its affairs in Hong Kong. 
Canada's latest travel advisory on Thursday warned of reports of increased screening of travelers' digital devices at border crossings between mainland China and Hong Kong.
'HIDDEN AIM'
Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said Canada’s decision not to allow local staff to visit the mainland was one for Canada, which it respected. If people came to China and followed the law, they would have no problems, he told a daily news briefing.
""But if you have a hidden aim, and are hatching a sinister plot, then I fear in China you need to be in a state of apprehension and extra careful.""
The Foreign Correspondents’ Club of China said it had received multiple reports of Chinese border officials detaining journalists and searching their digital devices when traveling between the mainland and Hong Kong. 
The protests are taking a toll on Hong Kong's economy and tourism, with the special administrative region on the cusp of its first recession in a decade.
Transport Secretary Frank Chan said airport passenger volume from Aug. 1 to Aug. 21 was down 11% from the same period last year, with cargo volume down 14%.
Commerce Secretary Edward Yau said visitor arrivals started to fall in mid-July. For Aug. 15 to Aug. 20, arrivals were down 49.6% on the corresponding 2018 period.
""It was the fastest and steepest drop in recent years, and the situation is obviously very worrisome,"" he told reporters.
The protests have caused corporate casualties, most dramatically at the Cathay Pacific (HK:0293) airline, amid mounting Chinese scrutiny of the involvement of some of its staff in protests.
Cathay confirmed on Friday that Rebecca Sy, the head of Cathay Dragon's Airlines Flight Attendants' Association, was no longer with the company. Her departure follows the shock resignation of Cathay Chief Executive Rupert Hogg last week.
Demonstrators have five demands: withdraw the extradition bill, set up an independent inquiry into the protests and perceived police brutality, stop describing the protests as ""rioting"", waive charges against those arrested, and resume political reform. 

Beijing has sent a clear warning that forceful intervention is possible, with paramilitary forces holding drills just over the border.

1390,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 23, 2019 08:47AM ET</span>",StockBeat: The Great Brexit Garage Sale is on as Hasbro Snaps up Peppa Pig,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- It's beginning to look like a pattern.
Another U.K. company has been snapped up by an overseas buyer. Last week it was pub chain   Greene King   (LON:GNK), bought by Hong Kong tycoon Li Ka-Shing for $5.5 billion including debt. This week, it’s Entertainment One (LON:ETO), the studio that owns the rights to children’s TV character Peppa Pig.
Hasbro (NASDAQ:HAS) has offered to pay $4 billion for eOne, a 28% premium to Thursday’s close in London, and 20% above the shares’ all-time high in May. The shares have risen by even more – just over 30% - in early trading on Friday, suggesting that some feel a competing bid could be around the corner.
In contrast to Greene King, Entertainment One has always traded like a growth stock with global ambitions, even if its most recent annual results were overshadowed by problems transitioning from the DVD age to the streaming one. Peppa Pig has proven particularly popular in China, where two themed attractions are set to open by year-end.
Other franchises such as PJ Masks are also globally marketable and should be able to command solid licensing fees in a world where streaming giants with deep pockets such as Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), Walt   Disney   (NYSE:DIS) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) are throwing ever-higher sums at original content.
What eOne and Greene King have in common is that they are both relatively small and digestible, like chipmaker ARM, snapped up on the cheap by Softbank during the initial post-Brexit shock to U.K. equities. They’re also cheapened by the fact that they belong to an asset class - U.K. mid-caps – that are the most unloved in the investing world due to the uncertainties over Brexit: Bank of America’s latest fund manager survey showed a net balance of 30% active managers underweight on U.K. equities. This at a time when the pound is close to 34-year lows against the dollar.
The pound – also an asset underweighted by global money managers – ticked up sharply on short-covering in the last two days as 10 Downing Street desperately tried to put a positive spin on Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s visits to France and Germany in search of a renegotiated Brexit deal. The fact that much of that spin relied on a mistranslation of Chancellor Angela Merkel’s words by government-friendly U.K. media says a lot about the actual progress achieved.
However, the sharpness of the bounce suggests that U.K. assets have now priced in so much bad news that the risks from here on may be more evenly balanced. The FTSE 250 and FTSE All Share led European gains on Friday, rising 1.1% and 0.8% respectively. The more globally-focused FTSE 100 was up 0.7% while the Stoxx 600 was up 0.6% in line with the German DAX. "

1393,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 23, 2019 08:36AM ET</span>",European investors find a bright spot in Brexit's murk: gilts,"By Virginia Furness and Tommy Wilkes
LONDON (Reuters) - Volatile sterling and the prospect of a damaging no-deal Brexit aren't hurting demand for British government bonds among foreign money managers, who are betting the debt will outperform if the UK does end up making a disorderly exit from the European Union.
The rally in British debt since June has halved yields on 10-year bonds, and while the moves are part of a global scramble into top-rated assets, a chunk of the new buyers are overseas managers positioning for no-deal Brexit, according to investors and bankers with experience of managing sovereign bond sales.
Added to this are relatively attractive yields -- 10-year gilts, as UK bonds are known, yield 0.55% (GB10YT=RR), compared with -0.65% for the 10-year German bund, or 0.15% for Spanish equivalents.
""You see (overseas) investors thinking very simply: where can I still get yield from,"" said David Zahn, head of European fixed income at Franklin Templeton.
Zahn, who has been buying gilts as a Brexit hedge, said this was a more attractive trade than betting against the pound -- the currency could rebound after Britain leaves the EU.
""If you see a no-deal Brexit, gilts will outperform,"" he said.
Bank of England data show foreign investors poured 7.3 billion pounds ($8.87 billion) into gilts in June, the latest month for which figures are available. Cumulative inflows since April were 19 billion pounds. Last year from April to June, non-residents added 1.5 billion pounds to gilts.
Monthly numbers can be volatile and are not seasonally adjusted. Redemptions of maturing bonds in one month can also distort data.
BoE figures show that cumulative inflows from overseas on a 12-month rolling window topped 32.8 billion pounds in June -- the highest since September 2017.
(Graphic: Foreign investment into British government bonds link: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/12/5157/5114/gilts.png)
Two London-based bankers told Reuters European buyers had been looking to diversify away from negative-yield home markets. In countries such as Sweden and Germany, all government bonds yield less than 0%, meaning investors are guaranteed to lose money if they hold bonds to maturity.
The bankers said the gilt trade had gained in popularity after Boris Johnson became prime minister in July and pledged to leave the EU by Oct. 31 with or without a transition agreement.
Asian investors have also been buying, one of the sources said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
Despite increased foreign buying, the source cautioned that domestic investors, who dominate the market, accounted for most of the new purchases.
For foreign managers, the cost of hedging sterling risk can wipe out any yield advantage from gilts. For euro-based buyers, for example, 10-year gilt yields approach the -0.6% that German Bunds pay, after hedging.
What investors are banking on is that after a disorderly Brexit, gilts will rally sharply.
""We are long gilts at the moment, we have set up a spread: long gilts versus short Bunds,"" said Marc Kersten, portfolio manager at German asset manager Union Investment.
A Brexit shock would sharply lower gilt yields because Britain's economy would be hit far worse hit than the euro zone's, he predicted. He said he would load up on more gilts if they sell off.
RATE CUTS?
Currently, money markets expect only a quarter-point interest rate cut in Britain by March 2020, compared with more immediate easing priced in for the United States and euro zone.
BoE policymakers have said rates could move either way after a no-deal Brexit. But most investors expect the central bank to slash rates quickly and even resume money-printing stimulus to stave off recession. Data show UK output already contracted in the second quarter.
""The outlook for the UK economy is challenged and the prospect of any interest rate hikes seems vanishingly small,"" said Sunil Krishnan, head of multi-asset funds at  Aviva  (LON:AV) Investors. ""The flow of funds does show euro zone investors remain significant participants in the gilt markets.""
A spokesman for the UK Debt Management Office said the increase in overseas gilt holdings may reflect investors rebalancing portfolios after recent sterling weakness.
Not everyone thinks buying gilts makes sense.
Alex McKnight, a portfolio manager at GAM Investments, recommends betting on a plunge in sterling instead of buying gilts, because the currency was likely to fall further with a no-deal Brexit than it would rise with a positive outcome.
Fund managers also warn that higher government spending to offset damaging Brexit consequences would actually boost yields, especially on longer-dated bonds. Some fear that any move toward higher spending in Germany and elsewhere would end the global bond rally.
""The moves in gilts could be quite violent downward, but then quickly reversed,"" said Colin Harte, multi-asset strategist at  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) Asset Management.

1395,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 23, 2019 08:01AM ET</span>",Japan's biggest asset manager to expand into U.S. market: CEO,"LONDON (Reuters) - Japan's biggest asset manager plans to expand into the United States for the first time as part of efforts to win more money from overseas clients, its chief executive told Reuters.
Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Asset Management (SMTAM), which manages around $600 billion in assets, aims to set up an office in New York, possibly next year, with an initial staff of around 10 people, Yoshio Hishida said.
The company, part of Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Holdings (T:8309), currently has overseas offices in London, Hong Kong and Singapore, with 12, 10 and two staff, respectively. Total group headcount is more than 500.
The U.S. move is the latest step in SMTAM's strategy to diversify away from its core Japanese market, which provides the bulk of its assets, including from the country's Government Pension Investment Fund - the world's biggest pension scheme.
""This is our brand new strategy, to expand into New York,"" Hishida said in an interview. ""We're at an early stage, but it [the set-up] will be similar to the UK,"" with a focus on serving institutional clients such as pension schemes and endowments.
""At the moment, we have almost nothing from U.S. and North American clients; the U.S. is a very tough market for non-U.S. managers, in general.""
As well as staffing the office with sales and research personnel, SMTAM would also look to develop new products especially for the U.S. market, potentially in areas such as Japanese microcap stocks and sustainable investing.
The U.S. move is in addition to plans already laid for a continental European branch in Luxembourg, in response to Britain's decision to leave the European Union.
SMTAM currently manages around $20 billion in assets for overseas clients, many of which are based in the Middle East and increasingly looking to move more of their money away from large U.S. and European investment managers, Hishida said.
""Based on the dynamic change of the politics and markets... they've realized it's maybe better to diversify the managers, as well as the market.
""If they think about non-U.S. managers, especially APAC [Asia-Pacific] managers, for Japanese equities as well as the passive strategies, fortunately, we've been selected as one of (them).... we didn't see that seven years ago.""
The group had grown its overseas client assets from $1.4 billion in 2012 and was looking to maintain that rate of growth, although it had no formal target, he said.
Japanese asset managers have increasingly looked to buy foreign rivals to bolster fee revenue, including  Sumitomo Mitsui Financial  Group (SMFG) (T:8316), which on Friday said it planned to buy British firm TT International. This follows last year's move by Mitsubishi UFJ Trust and Banking to buy Commonwealth Bank of Australia's (AX:CBA) fund arm.
While SMTAM, currently among the world's 10 biggest non-U.S. managers, would consider buying another asset manager to help fuel its growth, Hishida cited challenges in integrating two often quite different corporate and investing cultures.
""The integration of an asset management company is very tough, especially to do it quickly and properly. It's one option, but I don't have any particular plan, at this moment,"" he said."
1396,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 23, 2019 07:41AM ET</span>",Legal & General plans rival product to compete with new pension superfunds,"By Carolyn Cohn
LONDON (Reuters) - UK insurer  Legal & General  (L:LGEN) aims to take on incoming pension superfunds with a similar product of its own to bolster corporate retirement schemes, a company executive told Reuters.
Legal & General is already talking to employers and regulators about the product, which would be suitable for schemes that may not be able to afford a so-called bulk annuity - insurance that pensions will be paid in full - Laura Mason, CEO of Legal & General retirement institutional, said.
""We are working with a couple of (employer) sponsors,"" she said, adding that the product could be used by pension schemes with a ""medium"" level of funding. Mason did not give a time scale for the launch of the product.
Pension superfunds are a new pension investment model due to come on the market next year in Britain. They consolidate collective assets from various pension schemes, aiming to benefit from economies of scale and manage the money more efficiently.
Mason said L&G's product would be similar to a pensions superfund, but would not involve a total split of the pension scheme from its employer sponsor.
L&G is one of the biggest players in the bulk annuity market, which involves insuring company defined benefit, or final salary, pension schemes. Bulk annuity sales boosted L&G's first-half operating profit, after the company agreed Britain's largest ever bulk annuity in June, a 4.6 billion pound ($5.6 billion)deal with the Rolls Royce (L:RR) UK pension scheme.
The market is growing as companies seek to address huge deficits in Britain's 2 trillion pound final salary pension sector. Consultants predict up to 40 billion pounds in bulk annuity deals this year.
But critics say they are expensive, particularly for those schemes which are in deficit. For this reason, most pension funds which take out a bulk annuity are already well-funded.
The pension funding problem is Europe-wide, as people live longer and as years of central bank stimulus has depressed interest rates, leading to gaps between the fixed sums the pension schemes pay out and their investment income.
Britain's pensions industry has come up with the pension superfund model, which focuses on schemes which are not so well-funded, but differences over how to regulate the superfunds have delayed the first deals until next year.
New firms Clara Pensions and The Pension Superfund have said they have deals in the pipeline.
While The Pensions Regulator is expected to regulate the superfunds, L&G's product will be regulated by Britain's insurance regulator, the  Prudential  (LON:PRU) Regulation Authority, Mason said.
Some insurers see the superfunds as competition to the traditional bulk annuity market, while offering less protection to pensioners than a bulk annuity. But Mason said there was room for different types of company pension products.
""It's a massive market,"" she said, adding that the newer products would ""give the underlying scheme members better security compared with where they are today""."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) has agreed to pay more than $16 million to settle charges that it violated U.S. corruption laws by hiring relatives of foreign government officials in order to win or retain business, the U.S. regulator said in a statement. 
The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) alleged that Germany's largest lender hired poorly qualified or unqualified relatives of officials in Asia and Russia at their request, in violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.
Between at least 2006 and 2014, it said Deutsche employed relatives of executives working at state-owned enterprises in China and Russia with the ""primary goal"" of generating business for the company such as initial public offerings.
The SEC also found that Deutsche employees created false books and records that concealed corrupt hiring practices and failed to accurately document and record certain related expenses, violating internal accounting rules.
Under the settlement, Deutsche Bank did not admit or deny the findings, the SEC said.
""Deutsche Bank provided substantial cooperation to the SEC in its inquiry and has implemented numerous remedial measures to improve the bank’s hiring practices,"" a Deutsche spokesman said in a statement emailed to Reuters.
The $16 million settlement includes disgorgement of $10.8 million, interest of $2.4 million and a $3 million civil penalty, the SEC said. 
RUSSIA MISCONDUCT
Deutsche is one of several global banks to be investigated over the hiring of so-called ""princelings"" in China. 
In 2016 JPMorgan (N:JPM) agreed to pay U.S. authorities $264 million to resolve allegations it hired the relatives of Chinese officials to win banking deals, while  Credit Suisse  (S:CSGN) paid $77 million to settle a similar case last year.
However there have been fewer investigations of similar instances in Russia. 
The SEC said that from 2009 to 2012 ""Deutsche Bank employees hired relatives at the request of foreign officials in Russia to obtain or retain business or other benefits."" 
It gave an example from 2009 in which the bank was asked by an unnamed ""deputy minister"" at a Russian government entity to hire his daughter. 
""We must do it! We should have her in London as it is NOT politically correct to have her in Moscow!” the SEC quoted the bank's Russia chief in an email to his supervisors back then. 
Deutsche hired the daughter as a temporary employee in Moscow, according to the SEC. Four months later the bank failed to win a deal it had sought from the Russian government. 
The lender then arranged for the daughter to be given a permanent job and transferred to London, and 10 days later Deutsche Bank received a request for proposal signed by her father for a ""2 billion euro Eurobond issuance"", the SEC said. 
In a case in 2010 Deutsche hired the son of a senior executive at a Russian state-owned company in Moscow at that executive's request, according to the SEC.
The bank then transferred him to a graduate program in London despite the human resources department saying he was ""likely not eligible"" for the scheme. 
After two months the bank transferred him back to Moscow after human resources said he ""failed to come to work, cheated on an exam and was a 'liability to the reputation of the program, if not the firm."" 

The SEC said Deutsche had taken extensive remedial measures to fix its hiring compliance and internal accounting controls.

Powell’s comments will be his public ones on monetary policy since the bank cut rates in July. He'll be balancing the desire of President Donald Trump - and many in financial markets - for aggressive interest rate cuts, with recent data suggesting that the domestic economy is still robust. 
The chance of a 25 basis point interest rate cut in September is currently priced at 90%, with at least one more cut expected before the end of the year. 
Nasdaq 100 futures rose 22 points or 0.3% by 6:40 AM ET (10:40 GMT), while Dow futures gained 44 points or 0.2% and S&P 500 futures were up 6 points or 0.2%.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) rose 0.4% after Bloomberg reported that it agreed to buy batteries from South Korea's LG Chem (KS:051910) for electric vehicles manufactured in China. Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) climbed 7.2% after it raised its full-year forecast, while   Intuit   (NASDAQ:INTU) gained 5.4% after its earnings came in better than expected. 
Hasbro (NASDAQ:HAS), was in focus after falling 5.5% in after-hours trading on Thursday after announcing a $4 billion bid for U.K.-based Entertainment One (LON:ETO), the studio that owns the rights to children's TV character Peppa Pig. 
HP (NYSE:HPQ) slumped 7.8% after it announced that well-respected CEO Dion Weisler is stepping down for family reasons. It also said printing revenue fell in the third quarter, triggering fears for its highest-margin business.

1399,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 23, 2019 07:21AM ET</span>",Woodford struggles to build bridges with UK financial advisers,"By Carolyn Cohn, Sinead Cruise and Simon Jessop
LONDON (Reuters) - With his flagship 3.7 billion pound ($4.5 billion) fund frozen, money manager Neil Woodford has been traveling around Britain trying to convince independent financial advisers (IFAs) his firm remains a good long-term bet.
Many of those IFAs surveyed by Reuters remain skeptical.
Woodford, one of the UK's best-known fund managers, has given no media interviews or made any public appearances since his Equity Income Fund was suspended on June 3 after it ran out of cash to pay back investors seeking to leave.
But he has been giving presentations to independent IFAs, defending his investment thesis as he tries to convince them to tell their clients to stand by him.
Woodford has been ""fighting his corner"" said one source who attended the meetings, explaining his view of the markets and receiving a positive response, though two others said they did not find his arguments convincing.
The bulk of Woodford's business is won through IFAs directing client money to him, so winning them round will be crucial if he is to have any chance of salvaging his business. But a poll by Reuters suggests he has his work cut out.
A survey of 10 IFAs, which collectively direct around 50 billion pounds of retail fund investors' savings, found nine agreeing the damage to his reputation was ""irrevocable and a serious threat to his future career"".
Three said they were ""not very likely"" and seven ""very unlikely"" to recommend his funds in future. The survey was carried out between July 18 and Aug. 7.
Of the ten, five had clients invested with Woodford at the time of the suspension.
All were asked their views on damage to his brand, how likely they were to recommend him in future and why, and if they had attended a meeting with Woodford since the suspension.
Some of the respondents asked not to be named, though one less negative response came from Ben Benson, investment analyst at Gibbs Denley, who said he believed Woodford had not suffered permanent damage to his reputation.
A Woodford spokesman declined to comment on the poll but confirmed that since the suspension, ""Neil has met several hundred financial advisers, wealth managers and private client managers from across the UK.""
GOALPOSTS MOVED
Poll respondent David Inman at Chantler Kent said several of his clients had invested in funds run by Woodford when he was at his former employer Invesco and in the early days of Woodford Investment Management, but had got out more than two years ago.
Inman had grown concerned about Woodford's increasing exposure to unlisted and rarely traded stocks. ""The goalposts were somewhat significantly moved from when he started. At first it was a mirror image of Invesco, it kind of changed a bit.""
Two of the polled advisers had attended meetings with Woodford after the suspension but said they did not find his arguments convincing. ""He did not take enough responsibility for the position he has found himself in,"" said one.
Meetings took place in cities such as Bath in southwest England, Leicester in the Midlands and Harrogate in northern England, each attended by around 25 people, sources said.
Frank Corrigan from smaller financial advisory firm Corrigans met Woodford in Leicester in June and was more positive than the larger advisers polled by Reuters.
In a June blog post, Corrigan said the sale of two small company holdings at a premium to their valuation was one factor supporting Woodford's belief that current investors will be rewarded by a rise in the unit price by the time the Financial Conduct Authority and Woodford agree to restore daily trading.
The suspended fund's administrator has since said the fund will likely be closed until December. Corrigan did not respond to a request for an update on his comments.
Woodford had made a string of bets on domestically focused UK companies hit hard by Brexit concerns, and prior to the suspension there had been criticism of the fund's slant toward unlisted assets and persistent backing of poorly performing stocks such as  Provident Financial  (L:PFG) and Kier (L:KIE).
 Hargreaves  Lansdown (L:HRGV) had the fund in its ""Wealth 50"" best-buy list until the day of the suspension and wealth managers St James's Place (L:SJP) and Omnis had also given Woodford money to manage.
Hargreaves alone has nearly 300,000 clients trapped in the suspended fund and has led calls for Woodford to stop charging fees. Hargreaves dropped the fund from its best-buy list immediately after it was locked and has said it is considering its position on including it in its multi-manager funds.
Even individual investors with financial acumen have been caught out. One financial analyst who spoke to Reuters said he has more than 10,000 pounds of his own money invested.
""My advisers would say they have been blindsided, they weren't on top of the situation,"" he said. ""Because it was Neil Woodford, they gave him a bit of a longer leash.""

1400,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 23, 2019 07:16AM ET</span>","SoftBank-backed Oyo, known for budget stays, to rebrand Hooters hotel in Vegas","By Derek Francis
BENGALURU (Reuters) - SoftBank Group Corp-backed Indian hotel aggregator Oyo will rebrand a Hooters Casino Hotel in Las Vegas, a deal that a source with knowledge of the matter said was worth $135 million.
Oyo said on Friday it would partner with restaurant operator Highgate, which runs the Hooters hotel in Vegas, to rebrand it Oyo Hotel and Casino. The hotel, with 657 rooms and a 35,000 square-feet casino, will continue to be managed by Highgate.
The deal, Oyo's first such in the United States, suggests the startup is setting its sights high, but founder Ritesh Agarwal told Reuters in an interview that the company would continue to focus on its mainstay: large numbers of middle class travelers looking for affordable accommodation.
""Our focus on economy and mid-scale hotels will continue to remain, because, all said and done, that's the largest population of the world,"" Agarwal told Reuters on Thursday, ahead of the deal, speaking over the phone from Gurugram, near New Delhi.
As it looks to expand and targets the world's middle class, Oyo plans to hire up to 4,000 mid-and-senior level employees for domestic operations in the next six months, Agarwal said. Tens of thousands of junior employees, including front office staff, are likely to be hired for the hotels it franchises or leases out, he said.
Oyo, founded by 25-year-old Agarwal in 2013, started as a budget hotel aggregator in India. It expanded rapidly into markets such as China, Europe and the United States, and now manages over 23,000 properties across the world.
Valued at about $10 billion, Oyo now caters to an increasing number of corporate travelers who frequent its hotels because of affordable rents, cushioning the company from seasonal changes associated with the industry.
Agarwal, who recently took out a loan to buy back $2 billion worth of equity in the company, said he intended to spend on building technology and talent, not on discounts.
India and China account for two-thirds of the company's revenue, while a fifth comes from Europe and the United States, Agarwal said."
1401,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 23, 2019 07:03AM ET</span>",Huawei Puts a Price on Trump’s Aggression,"(Bloomberg) -- Huawei Technologies Co. expects U.S. export restrictions to reduce annual revenue at its consumer devices business by about $10 billion, as the company is banned from buying American components like semiconductors and software.
China’s largest technology company is seeking ways to replace key U.S. suppliers such as Cadence Design (NASDAQ:CDNS) Systems Inc. and Synopsys (NASDAQ:SNPS) Inc., Deputy Chairman Eric Xu said Friday. The overall damage to the company will be a “little less” than billionaire founder Ren Zhengfei’s initial estimate, Xu added.
Huawei is seeking to develop alternatives after coming under intense pressure from the Trump Administration, which has argued its technology represents a security threat. On Friday, it introduced its most powerful artificial intelligence chipset, the Ascend 910, which is poised to rival some of the best offerings from Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc. and Nvidia Corp. Earlier this month, it offered the first glimpse of an in-house software -- HarmonyOS -- that may someday replace Google’s Android.
The company is also researching ways to replace chip-design software tools offered by Cadence and Synopsys, Xu told a news briefing in Shenzhen without elaborating. “There were no chip design tools 10 years ago, but the industry still developed chips,” said Xu, who argued that Cadence and Synopsys were not must-haves for design. “Intel started to develop chips in the 1970s, when those companies didn’t exist.”
Since May, Huawei has occupied the uncomfortable position of being both an established global brand and a member of the U.S. Entity List, which bars it from trading freely with American suppliers. Despite a series of 90-day reprieves, the latest of which came this week, the uncertainty caused by American sanctions has already cost the company a great deal.
Even if Huawei is eventually brought in from the cold, the impact of this summer’s upheaval will be widespread and painful. Already, it reported slower sales growth in the second quarter compared to the first as the ban started to bite, especially into a consumer business encompassing smartphones and laptops. That in turn is accelerating Huawei’s effort to become self-reliant.
One area in which the Chinese company is rapidly developing in-house expertise is semiconductors, propelling Beijing’s ambitions of weaning itself off foreign chips. HiSilicon -- Huawei’s chip design subsidiary -- has been developing its capabilities for a long time, and it’s recently grown into the second largest customer (after Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL).) for the world’s biggest chip manufacturing contractor Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Huawei has also elevated the presence of home-grown technologies throughout its product line -- from base stations to smartphones and servers -- as a key step to limiting the damage of the U.S. ban.
The Ascend 910 processor unveiled Friday is a show of technological prowess. It will be used for AI model training, and Huawei says it outperforms all existing competition. Xu proclaimed that “without a doubt, it has more computing power than any other AI processor in the world.” The company also unveiled MindSpore, an AI computing framework that -- along with the 910 -- is supposedly twice as fast as Google’s TensorFlow.
”The May 16 sanctions incident had no impact on the execution of Huawei’s AI strategy nor commercialization of AI products,” said Xu. “Our R&D project related to AI is building up steadily.”

1403,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 23, 2019 06:51AM ET</span>",Exclusive: 'Dear Vladimir': VTB asks for Putin's help to create Russian grain champion,"By Polina Devitt, Gleb Stolyarov and Tatiana Voronova
MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian state-controlled bank VTB (MM:VTBR) has asked President Vladimir Putin to help it create a Russian grain champion to curb the role of foreign traders and give the state greater control over exports, a letter seen by Reuters shows.
The letter from VTB Chairman Andrey Kostin dated June 26 made the case for why the Kremlin should give VTB the go-ahead for its plan, which would weaken leading Russian grain traders. Along with local firms, global giants  Glencore  (L:GLEN), Cargill, Louis Dreyfus and Cofco all trade Russian grain.
VTB and the Kremlin did not respond to requests for comments about the letter.
Russia has become increasingly concerned about food security and reducing its reliance on imports since Western sanctions were imposed in 2014 following Moscow's annexation of Crimea so has an interest in having a tighter grip on its grain markets.
Moscow has also been concerned about getting the right balance between domestic consumption and exports to avoid sharp rises in prices at home which would be unpopular, especially with the country's meat industry which depends on Russian grain to feed its livestock.
Hand-written notes on the letter made on July 11 show that President Putin told the government to consider the proposal by VTB, Russia's second largest bank.
""Dear Vladimir Vladimirovich,"" the letter starts. ""Given Russia's agricultural export potential (the equivalent of $45bn in 2024) and also the importance of ensuring reliable grain trade in the context of national food security, VTB has drawn up a plan to create a national leader, a vertically-integrated operator that would be called 'United Grain Holding'.""
The new holding company would consolidate a raft of assets related to grain exports and storage and ""take on the role of a leading Russian wheat trader"", VTB said.
VTB, whose traditional banking business has come under pressure internationally after it was hit by Western sanctions, urged the government to support upgrading infrastructure around two strategic Black Sea ports: Novorossiisk and Taman.
MORE ASSETS
The letter lifts the lid on the extent of VTB's plans. It has already transformed itself into the largest operator of grain infrastructure in Russia over the past year and now wants to become a leading grain exporter.
It said in the letter it would need another two to three years to consolidate and acquire more assets.
Russia has boosted production and exports of wheat in recent years due to favorable weather and a weaker rouble currency to become the world's largest exporter, competing with the United States, France and Canada.
But Putin wants to go further. A year ago he set a goal of boosting Russia's exports of agricultural products to $45 billion by 2024 from $26 billion in 2018. About $10 billion of the 2018 total came from grain exports.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) expects Russia's wheat exports to total 34.0 million tonnes this season, down from 35.7 million in the 2018/19 season.
VTB's push to consolidate assets into a single holding company effectively controlled by the state is reminiscent of an approach taken in other sectors such as civil aircraft manufacturing and shipbuilding with mixed success.
VTB First Deputy CEO Yuri Soloviev told Reuters in June that the bank believed its move into grain would increase the competitiveness of Russian agricultural products abroad.
""A local and international trading platform, logistics, and transhipment (facilities) have been created. In general, our strategy is to achieve synergies by combining assets in export transportation logistics and trade,"" Soloviev said.
As of early June, VTB had invested about $1 billion in its grain projects, Soloviev told Reuters.
TERMINAL MOVES
VTB has already taken major strides by buying stakes in two Black Sea grain export terminals at Novorossiisk, Russia's main deep-sea grain export hub. These deals gave VTB control of 25% of Russia's grain export capacity at ports.
VTB has also bought part of Russia's largest grain rail-wagon owner Rustranscom (RTC). And this month, VTB fleshed out its portfolio of grain assets by buying a controlling stake in major local grain trader Mirogroup.
U.S. global trader Cargill has a stake in another grain terminal in Novorossiisk, while its rival Glencore owns half of a terminal in the nearby Black Sea port of Taman.
In its letter, VTB asked the government to approve a change of ownership in the Taman grain terminal, which is now linked to the Crimean peninsula by the new Kerch Bridge.
Half the terminal is owned by Ukraine's Kernel group (WA:KER), VTB said, noting the firm was under Russian sanctions. It said it had already struck a preliminary deal with Kernel to acquire its stake, but needed the government's sign-off.
VTB said combining Taman with a terminal in Novorossiisk into one cluster would bring synergies and greater capacity.
VTB told Putin it would also need the government to support the state-financed modernization of worn-out rail tracks and roads to improve access to Novorossiisk and Taman.
It also asked the government to consider privatizing a 25% stake in United Grain Company, an existing state-owned grain trader in which VTB already has a stake of 50% minus one share.
'SMILE AND WAVE'
In the same letter to Putin, VTB took aim at international grain traders to bolster its case.
The foreign firms continued to play a key role in servicing Russia's grain exports, it said. Citing expert estimates, it said they controlled 25% of grain transhipment capacity in sea ports and about half of Russian wheat trade in global markets.
VTB said the traders did not always carry out their functions with ""optimal conditions for Russia"", and accused them of leaving a significant part of the added value offshore.
Traders have been keeping a wary eye on the march of a powerful Russian bank into the grain sector. For them, it means tougher competition in ports and traditional markets.
""Smile and wave,"" one trader said when asked what his strategy to deal with competition from VTB was for the 2019/20 season, which started on July 1.
VTB's newly-acquired trader, Mirogroup, plans to export 6 million tonnes of grain, including 5 million tonnes of wheat, from Novorossiisk in the 2019/20 season, one source familiar with its plans said.
Last season, Mirogroup exported 2.5 million tonnes of grain, the source said.
If Mirogroup succeeds in more than doubling its exports, it would become one of Russia's top three grain exporters, alongside local trader RIF and Glencore.
Mirogroup is targeting Egypt, including state grain buyer GASC, Turkey and other traditional markets for Russian wheat.
The aim of VTB's proposed grain holding company is to control the supply chain from producer to consumer and to become a multinational giant in a market where Russia already dominates, the source said.
""This does not mean that VTB wants to monopolize everything using state influence,"" the source said.
""The grain market is quite chaotic, and it is likely that in the near future it will acquire the outlines of a civilized industry. It will be in the Russian legal sphere, will be paying taxes, and creating jobs."""

 Swedbank  (ST:SWEDa), Sweden's oldest retail bank, has lost more than a third of its market value after its Estonian business was embroiled in a money laundering scandal.
In April, Swedbank admitted some failings in its money laundering processes and is working with the financial watchdogs.
The most recent allegations against Swedbank, reported by Swedish state TV in March, say it processed gross transactions of up to 20 billion euros ($22 billion) a year from high-risk, mostly Russian non-residents, through Estonia from 2010 to 2016.
Swedbank is the subject of a joint probe by the Swedish and the Baltic financial watchdogs, originally scheduled to be completed in October. SEB (ST:SEBa), which also has big operations in the Baltics, has been included in the probe. The bank has said it is comfortable with the way it has acted.
""FI (the Swedish FSA) plans to communicate the results of the investigations no later than the beginning of next year, which is later than FI previously indicated. The main reason is the considerable amount of material in the investigations,"" the FSA said in the statement.
Swedbank is also under investigation in the United States and faces the potential threat of hefty sanctions and fines.

1406,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 23, 2019 04:57AM ET</span>","Stocks, dollar climb before Powell's Jackson Hole speech","By Ritvik Carvalho
LONDON (Reuters) - World stock markets and the dollar rose on Friday as investors looked to a speech by Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell for clarification on whether the U.S. central bank remains on course to deliver another interest rate cut in next month.
Suggesting markets remain broadly confident of further Fed easing, European stocks rebounded from the previous day's falls, with the pan-European STOXX 600 index gaining as much as half a percent in early deals. Britain's FTSE 100 index was up 0.64%. 
MSCI's All Country World Index, which tracks shares across 47 countries, was up 0.1% and set to break a three-week losing streak.
Earlier in Asia, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan edged 0.3% higher and was up 1.0% for the week, on track to break a four-week losing streak. Japan's benchmark Nikkei advanced 0.4% and Australian stocks added 0.3%.
The dollar rose 0.2% against a basket of peer currencies. 
Powell is due to speak at 1400 GMT at a gathering of central bankers in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. 
While markets overwhelmingly expect the Fed to follow up its first rate cut in a decade with more stimulus at its meeting next month, some policymakers are not keen.
Kansas City Fed President Esther George, who dissented against the decision to ease in July - for the first time since the financial crisis - and Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker, who said he ""reluctantly"" supported the cut, both said the U.S. economy did not need more stimulus at this point.
Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan said businesses had become much more cautious due to surprises on trade policy and he was ""going to at least be open-minded about making some adjustment"" if he saw continued weakness.
That has made Powell's speech pivotal for markets as they look for any clues on future policy direction. 
""Judging by the minutes from the July meeting the central bank seems content to sit on their hands, but it is worth remembering the U.S.-China trade situation has intensified, and so has the unrest in Hong Kong, and that might prompt Mr. Powell to be a touch more dovish than he was in late July,"" said David Madden, markets analyst at CMC Markets in London.
U.S. stock futures were up 0.35%, pointing to gains on Wall Street later in the day.
In the U.S. bond market, the two-year/10-year yield curve briefly moved back into inversion territory overnight, a shift that also occurred last week and hit financial markets amid worries that it presaged a sharp global downturn.
""There's been no jaw-dropping news this week but we have had incrementally less bond-friendly news - the FOMC minutes, the euro area PMIs, and Fed speakers in recent days that give the impression that July was an insurance rate cut,"" said John Davies, G10 rates strategist at  Standard Chartered  (LON:STAN) Bank.
""This has dragged the market away from speculating about 25-50 basis points rate cut in September to a discussion on a 25 bps cut to will they cut rates, so a bit more uncertainty has been injected into markets.""
Markets are however still pricing in a 98.8% probability of a 25-basis-point cut on Sept. 18.
The euro eased marginally to $1.1073. A survey showing a surprise uptick in euro zone business growth for August was offset by trade war fears, knocking future expectations to their weakest in over six years.
The pound fell half a percent to $1.2195, reversing most of the gains made on Thursday after traders interpreted encouraging comments on Brexit from German Chancellor Angela Merkel to mean a solution to the Irish border problem could be found before Britain leaves the EU on Oct. 31. [GBP/] 
China's yuan recovered some ground after hitting an 11-1/2 year low.
Spot yuan slid to as low as 7.0992 per dollar, its weakest since March 2008. China's central bank set the midpoint rate at 7.0572, its weakest level in 11-1/2 years but much stronger than traders had expected.
Washington labeled China a currency manipulator this month after a sharp slide in the yuan. Concern about China's economy is growing because U.S. tariffs on roughly $150 billion of Chinese goods will take effect from Sept. 1.
Oil prices weakened, with both Brent crude and U.S. West Texas Intermediate down 0.1%. Brent crude traded at $59.89 per barrel and WTI crude at $55.31.

Gold eased and was set for its worst week in nearly five months. Spot gold was down 0.2% at $1,495.60 an ounce.

Japan suffered its worst energy crisis since the war after a March 2011 quake and tsunami led to a three-reactor meltdown at the Fukushima site, spewing radiation that forced 160,000 people to flee.
The plan to be submitted on Monday could take to 26 the units set to be decommissioned by Japanese nuclear operators, or nearly half their pre-disaster fleet, while Tepco will be left with two of its 17 units before the Fukushima disaster.
Nuclear power met about 30% of Japan's electricity requirements before the March 2011 tsunami, but the eventual shutdown of all its reactors forced record imports of thermal coal and liquefied natural gas to replace the lost capacity.
Tepco's president will meet authorities in the city of Kashiwazaki-Kariwa in Niigata prefecture, where the station is located, to explain the utility's response to a request to mothball the five reactors, spokeswoman Emi Iwasa told Reuters by telephone.
Iwasa declined to provide any further comment.
Tepco has been trying to convince local authorities, who have sign-off rights on restarts, that it has overcome operational failings revealed at Fukushima and is competent to safely restart a reactor at Kashiwazaki-Kariwa.
The plant, north-northwest of Tokyo, was damaged in an earthquake in 2007 that led to a small release of radiation and residents are wary of any restart.
Three of the reactors have been shut since the 2007 quake and the other four were idled in the months after the Fukushima disaster.
Two of Kashiwazaki Kariwa's reactors, the newest, have been won initial approval from regulators to restart, but prefectural authorities are carrying out an inquiry into Tepco's handling of Fukushima before they agree to any restart.
City officials at Kashiwazaki Kariwa want Tepco to shut units 1 to 5 in return for restarting reactors No.6 and No.7, media have said.
A Reuters analysis late last year showed it was unlikely that the five units would ever restart.
Japan has six operating reactors, many of which are still going through a relicencing process under new safety standards imposed after the disaster highlighted regulatory and operational failings.
In 2016, the government estimated a total cost of about $200 billion for dismantling Fukushima Daiichi, decontaminating the affected areas, and paying compensation."
1409,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 23, 2019 03:53AM ET</span>",Shares in Peppa Pig owner rise past Hasbro offer,"(Reuters) - Peppa Pig-owner Entertainment One's (L:ETO) shares rose more than 30% to a record high on Friday, surpassing the price agreed by the company's board with U.S. toy maker  Hasbro Inc  (O:HAS) in a sign that investors see some chance of a counter offer.
The boards of the two companies said on Thursday that they had agreed a price of roughly $4 billion (3.27 billion pounds) in cash for the deal, which gives Hasbro access to Entertainment One's lucrative shows aimed at infants and preschoolers.
Under the deal, Entertainment One's shareholders will receive 560 pence per share, representing a premium of 26.4% to Thursday's close. Entertainment One's shares rose to as much as 579 pence on Friday.
""Given the nature of the current content cycle where there are a number of emerging large new entrants and platforms alongside several large incumbents, we would not rule out a competing bid for eOne,"" RBC analysts, who raised their price target for Entertainment One, said. 
The buyout offer comes months after eOne denied reports that award-winning producer Mark Gordon would leave the company and said he will continue to develop and produce content for the company following a multi-year production deal.
Entertainment One, which started life as a Canadian record and tape retailer, reported a 21% rise in annual underlying core earnings to 198 million pounds in May, driven by growth in family and brands business as well as higher margins in its film, television and music unit. 
The company had rejected a 1 billion-pound takeover offer from British commercial broadcaster  ITV  (L:ITV) in 2016, saying it undervalued the production and distribution company.
""For Hasbro to buy Entertainment One for the Family & Brands division makes a lot of sense, adding Peppa Pig, PJ Masks and the newer Ricky Zoom brands to its licensing portfolio,"" Fiona Orford Williams (NYSE:WMB), Director, Media Analyst, Edison Group, said. 
""It is much less clear how the film, TV and music division fits in the enlarged group."" 

Entertainment One's shares were 29.5% higher at 574 pence at 0729 GMT, at the top of London's midcap index (FTMC). ITV's shares were also 3.9% higher, taking second spot on the bluechip index (FTSE).

1411,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 23, 2019 02:51AM ET</span>",India Inc grows impatient as economy dips and Modi is distracted,"By Abhirup Roy and Alexandra Ulmer
MUMBAI (Reuters) - When Prime Minister Narendra Modi was re-elected in May with a sweeping majority, Indian stock markets jumped to all-time highs as investors anticipated big bang pro-business reforms to revive a flagging economy.
But sentiment is souring in the country's boardrooms after a much-anticipated budget in July failed to provide any stimulus, and instead hiked taxes on the ultra-rich and on foreign portfolio investors.
Several businessmen say Modi's government needs to take swift action on the economy, but instead it seems preoccupied with the situation in Kashmir, which is under a lockdown after authorities curtailed the autonomy of the restive region.
""The speed of decision-making is very good for example in Kashmir, but the speed of decision-making on business matters is not good,"" said Adi Godrej, chairman of the Godrej Group, which sells everything from electronics to chemicals.
""India Inc is worried that the slowdown may deepen further. We need action,"" Godrej said in an interview, citing tax breaks for the auto sector and big companies among his top wishes ahead of his taking any major decisions to weather the slowdown.
India's GDP growth in January-March slid to a near five-year low of 5.8%, and most analysts expect data due later this month to show that growth in April-June faltered even further.
India GDP Growth - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/12/5127/5084/Pasted%20Image.jpg
Domestic passenger vehicle sales, a key economic indicator, plunged an annual 31% in July - the steepest recorded pace of decline in nearly two decades.
Godrej's fears were echoed in interviews with over a dozen businessmen, fund managers, foreign investors and executives with multinationals, revealing widespread unhappiness among the very business elite that cheered Modi to power.
Modi's office did not respond to requests for comment.
Companies have already started to cut their workforces. The autos sector alone has laid off about 350,000 workers since April and even companies like cookie maker Parle - which sells biscuits for as little as 5 rupees, or 7 cents, a pack - have warned they may have to lay off up to 10,000 workers, due to weakening demand.
The broad Nifty index (NSEI) has shed more than 10 percent since hitting a high in June, in part pressured by the trade war between the United States and China. Foreign portfolio investors yanked $1.8 billion out of Indian equities in July alone.

HEAVY LOBBYING
Investors say they want clarity from Modi on what his government plans to do about the economy, and the beleaguered lending sector. Banks are grappling with almost $150 billion in bad loans and a massive shadow lending industry has been stung by a liquidity crunch after the collapse of major player Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services (IL&FS).
Foreign portfolio investors seeking a tax cut and automakers demanding easier access to finance for dealers and buyers have flocked to New Delhi to lobby Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman.
Similarly, bankers have urged the government to announce a stimulus package that drives investment and new lending.
The Finance Ministry did not respond to questions about any planned measures. Officials in New Delhi, speaking on condition of anonymity, told Reuters the government is unlikely to provide a stimulus or tax breaks because this could compromise India's fiscal deficit target of 3.3% for fiscal 2019-20.
Krishnamurthy Subramanian, India's chief economic adviser, said on Thursday that using public money to help the private sector was a ""moral hazard.""
Some banking and finance executives who met Sitharaman recently have criticized her, saying her attitude during meetings was not constructive.
""There is no discussion. It is mostly: 'Thank you we'll look into it',"" said one investor of a meeting with her.
The Finance Ministry did not respond to requests for comment about the meetings.
The Reserve Bank of India has been slashing interest rates, including an unconventional 35 basis point cut this month, but the stressed banking sector has yet to fully pass on the benefits of lower rates.
Modi's supporters point to his successes though, including a unified goods and services tax in 2017 that they say is poised to bring more of the informal economy into the tax net, and contend businesses should be patient.
""The economy has slowed down liked the rest of the world, but I remain optimistic about the future,"" said Sunil Alagh, the head of marketing firm SKA Advisors, and a Modi supporter. ""Modi will take corrective action.""
FEAR FACTOR
Many businessmen also say the government is going overboard in a drive against tax evasion, corruption and money laundering.
Indian coffee baron V.G. Siddhartha apparently killed himself last month, and purportedly left behind a letter blaming tax authorities for ""harassment.""
Naresh Goyal, the founder of bankrupt carrier Jet Airways (NS:JET), and his wife were stopped from flying out of India in May, while former finance minister P. Chidambaram was arrested on Wednesday after police officers scaled the wall of his New Delhi home in an operation shown on national television.
State-run bankers have privately said they are too afraid to take haircuts on soured loans or lend to troubled companies for fear of later being accused of wrongdoing.
Modi has said he is merely ensuring white collar criminals are not let off the hook.
In his Independence Day address on Aug. 15 though, Modi did try to assuage corporate India's fears, saying ""We should stop viewing our wealth creators with suspicion: they deserve greater respect.""
Still, with no specifics on how the government plans to address the jitters, many businessmen remain disillusioned.
""Five years ago it was a new beginning. It was like when you fall in love,"" said a Mumbai-based manufacturer, asking to remain anonymous for fear of retribution. ""Now the dream is punctured."""

1413,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 23, 2019 02:38AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Japanese utilities start selling uranium fuel into depressed market,"By Aaron Sheldrick and Yuri Harada
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's nuclear operators are starting to sell some of their huge holdings of uranium fuel, as chances fade of restarting many more reactors eight years after the Fukushima nuclear disaster.
The sales so far have been small, but were made at values well below their purchase price and are likely to further depress the already beaten-down uranium market, say two senior market specialists. 
They could also focus attention on the balance sheets of the country's utilities, bolstered by holdings of nuclear fuel valued at 2.5 trillion yen ($24 billion), a figure that market experts say is highly unrealistic.
""Given the extended shutdown of our reactors, we are selling uranium as well as cancelling long-term contracts where necessary,"" Japan Atomic told Reuters in a statement.
The company, which is yet to receive all the regulatory approvals needed to restart reactors at either of its two nuclear stations, declined to provide further details. 
Before the meltdowns at Tokyo Electric Power's (T:9501) Fukushima plant in March 2011 after an earthquake and tsunami, Japan was the world's third-biggest user of nuclear power behind the United States and France, operating 54 nuclear reactors.
It is permanently shutting 40% of its facilities and just nine of the 33 remaining have restarted. With reactors also being closed in the United States, Germany, Belgium and other countries, traders and specialists say the market is likely to remain depressed for years.
FUELING REACTORS
Unlike other commodities such as crude oil, most of the nuclear fuel market is privately traded, generally on long-term contracts, although CME Group's NYMEX has a futures contract for uranium oxide (U308) (UXXc1).
GRAPHIC: Uranium prices since the beginning of 2010 - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/JAPAN-NUCLEAR-FUEL/0H001QER67ZJ/eikon.png
The contract is settled on prices supplied by U.S.-based UxC LLC and is currently trading at about a third of where it was before Fukushima. U.S. based UxC, LLC also calculates prices for converted and enriched uranium.
Sales by Japanese utilities ""are definitely showing up more in the market,"" said one U.S.-based market specialist, who requested anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the industry. 
""Some are selling uranium, some are selling more upstream products or services,"" such as enriched uranium, he said. ""Japanese inventory is a big overhang in the market.""
A senior fuel trader told Reuters his company had purchased nuclear fuel from a Japanese utility but declined to give details.
Japan Atomic was responding to a Reuters survey of 10 Japanese utilities that have operated nuclear plants. All the other utilities declined to comment on whether they had sold any nuclear fuel.
One said it adjusts supplies for optimal inventory levels and three said they have delayed deliveries of fuel.
Tepco in 2017 canceled a supply contract with Canadian uranium fuel producer  Cameco  (TO:CCO), which was awarded $40.3 million in damages last month by an arbitration panel.
""Tepco has made efforts to reduce its holdings of nuclear fuel, such as by partly reducing uranium purchase contracts,"" the company told Reuters, without giving further details.
ASSET COUNT
Unlike in Europe and the United States, Japanese utilities are not required to mark to market their fuel holdings. They are booked on Japanese operators' balance sheets as fixed assets at the purchase price, the utilities told Reuters. 
""If the utilities are not going to use the fuel, and it is unlikely they will get many more reactors going, then at some point they will have to take losses on their holdings,"" said Tom O'Sullivan, the founder of energy consultancy Mathyos Japan.
GRAPHIC: Japan utilities' nuclear fuel holdings - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/12/5062/5019/nuclear-fuel-holdings.png
Company accounts for the financial year ended in March showed that nuclear fuel valuations ranged from nearly two times market capitalization in the case of Hokkaido Electric Power (T:9509) to 16 percent for Chubu Electric Power. (T:9502)
Sector-wide the nuclear fuel valuation is nearly 50 percent of the market value of the nine publicly traded utilities, calculations by Reuters showed.
Japanese utilities also count spent fuel that is being reprocessed into highly toxic plutonium for future use in reactors as an asset on their balance sheets.
The country has the world's biggest inventory of plutonium held by a state without nuclear weapons, but experts say it may be more of a liability than an asset. 
""That is not something they can sell and get paid for,"" said Tomas Kaberger, energy and environment professor at Chalmers University of Technology and a board member of Swedish nuclear operator Vattenfall.

""It is something they will have to spend a lot of money on to build a repository for that can last a few hundred thousand years,"" Kaberger said.

1414,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 23, 2019 02:36AM ET</span>",Protest fears stalk Hong Kong businesses as China threat looms,"By Clare Jim
HONG KONG (Reuters) - Walking a tightrope between anti-government protests and political masters in Beijing, many Hong Kong firms are opting to toe the Communist Party line to avoid potential repercussions having seen what happened at Cathay Pacific Airways.
Last week the airline lost its CEO after Beijing exerted political pressure, and on Friday the head of Cathay Dragon's Airlines Flight Attendants' Association said she was fired, without explanation, after managers saw and confirmed her Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) account.
Workers in other sectors, particularly in the financial industry, have also said they are afraid to even talk about the protests among colleagues or in message groups for fear they could be snitched to management if they voice support for the protest movement.
""Now the best way is to keep silent, because people could back-stab you for no obvious benefits,"" said one person who said they were reported to management by a colleague.
One Hong Kong-based worker of a Chinese state-owned enterprise recently bragged in a WeChat chat group that he had been reporting employees who posted pro-democracy comments regarding the protests to human resources.
In extreme cases, some people said they had received calls from Chinese authorities after posting pro-protest comments on Facebook.
""It feels like we're back to the era of Cultural Revolution,"" said the executive of a large corporate, referring to the decade-long campaign unleashed by Mao Zedong on China in 1966, which encouraged people to inform on friends, colleagues and family members who did not follow the Communist Party line.
This fear of denunciation has been dubbed ""the white terror"" by Hong Kongers, distressed by the erosion of wide-ranging freedoms promised to the former British colony under a ""one country, two systems"" formula when it returned to Chinese rule in 1997.
The most high profile corporate casualty of the rising intolerance was Rupert Hogg, who resigned as CEO of Hong Kong flag carrier Cathay Pacific Airways (HK:0293) after China demanded that the airline suspend staff involved in, or who support, the demonstrations that have roiled the city.
""The Cathay incident shows that when doing business in Hong Kong, politics and business are inseparable ... it's quite an alarming message,"" said a senior pro-Beijing politician.
Cathay's new chief executive said this week the company has zero tolerance for any support or participation in illegal protests.
""The way every single one of us acts, not only at work serving our customers but also outside work – on social media and in everyday life – impacts how we are perceived as a company. We have made very clear that we have zero tolerance for illegal activities,"" CEO Augustus Tang said.
Demanding the reinstatement of the sacked head of the cabin crew association, Rebecca Sy, the Hong Kong Federation of Trade Unions called on Cathay Pacific, which is 30% owned by Air China (SS:601111), to put an end to the ""white terror"".
""THERE'D BE BLOWBACK""
An expatriate business executive told Reuters the Cathay Pacific case had unnerved some companies, while a lawyer said he had inquiries from people asking if it was legal to check through employees' phones or social media accounts.
""As Hong Kong companies, we thought we could run the company by 'one country two systems', but to Chinese regulators, they want us run like 'one country, one system',"" an executive of a large Hong Kong corporation with business in China said.
All six people Reuters spoke to declined to be named as the issue is sensitive and they were worried their company could be targeted for speaking out.
Pressure has also spilled into the ""Big Four"" accounting firms, which published separate public statements late last week opposing violent acts in the city and voicing support for the ""one country, two systems"" principle. The notices came after an advert purportedly purchased by their employees was published in newspaper Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Daily supporting the protests, drawing criticism from mainland media.
China's state-owned tabloid Global Times criticized the firms for not issuing official responses, ""as major firms have an obligation to let the public know their stances on the matter"".
Property developers, including CK Asset (HK:1113) - owned by tycoon Li Ka-shing - and Sun Hung Kai Properties (HK:0016), have also denounced violent protests in newspaper notices since early last week, following a lead by the Real Estate Developers Association (REDA).
REDA's statements were initiated by the Hong Kong government, and developers felt taking out additional adverts was ""the right thing to do"", according to two people with knowledge of the matter.
REDA said the ads were not initiated by the government and merely reflected the association's views. The government declined to say if it proposed the ad campaign but said it shared the association's view.
Developers are also on tenterhooks after a major shopping center was criticized by demonstrators for allowing police to enter a mall and arrest protesters, while the Global Times criticized another mall for ""kowtowing to radical protesters"" by not letting police enter.
""In the beginning we wanted to please both pro and anti-protest people, but we learned it's not possible,"" an official at a property developer said. ""We cannot not allow police to go into the malls, otherwise there'd be blowback."""

Hong Kong's flagship carrier has become the biggest corporate casualty of the city's anti-government protests after China demanded the airline suspend staff involved in, or who support, the demonstrations that have roiled the city.
Sy's departure, which Cathay confirmed on Friday, follows the shock resignation of Cathay CEO Rupert Hogg last week.
Sy said at a press conference on Friday she was fired after managers saw and confirmed her Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) account. Management did not provide a reason for her dismissal, she added.
Pilots and cabin crew at Hong Kong's flagship carrier have described a ""white terror"" of political denunciations, sackings and phone searches by Chinese aviation officials amid anti-government protests gripping the former British colony.
Cathay said ahead of the press conference on Friday that recent weeks had been extremely challenging for its employees.
""We thank all our dedicated staff who are committed to serving our customers in a professional manner,"" Cathay Pacific Director Corporate Affairs James Tong said.
The airline, 30% owned by Air China (SS:601111), became embroiled in crosswinds between Beijing and pro-democracy groups in the Asian financial hub after some of its employees took part in the Hong Kong protests."
1416,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 23, 2019 12:57AM ET</span>",German Industry Is Being Battered By a Perfect Storm,"(Bloomberg) -- Deep in Europe’s manufacturing core, a German company is taking radical steps to cope with a perfect storm that has sent traditional economic pillars into a tailspin and put the country on the verge of recession.
Huebner GmbH -- a 73-year-old supplier of rubber and plastics that employs 3,300 people around the world -- is selling its unit that makes accelerator pedals, key pads and auto-body parts after getting squeezed by Germany’s carmakers. Instead, it’ll focus on public transport and -- in a completely new endeavor -- making lasers.
The move reflects how Europe’s largest economy -- reliant on exports and a world leader in the century-old industries of cars, machines and chemicals -- is at a critical juncture. It’s being hit by U.S. President Donald Trump’s protectionism and Brexit uncertainty just as companies struggle with a high-risk transition to greener products and smarter digital factories.
The German economy shrank in the second quarter and could do so again this quarter. The latest warning sign came on Thursday, when a nationwide gauge showed orders at factories and services companies dropping at the fastest pace in six years. More German companies now expect output to fall rather than rise over the next 12 months, the first time that’s happened since 2014.
With day-to-day business roiled by geopolitical power plays, German giants like  Siemens  AG (DE:SIEGn), BASF SE (DE:BASFN) and  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn) have been forced to lower profit forecasts and seek ways to cut costs. Smaller brethren like Huebner say they’re being pushed too hard in the fallout.
The shift to new markets was made because big manufacturers are mistreating suppliers by “forcing them into ever lower prices,” said Chief Executive Officer Reinhard Huebner, son of the founder who fled the advancing Russian army in the 1940s before starting the Kassel-based company.
Products such as the folding bellows that connect bus and tram carriages are “a better and safer place” than the auto industry as cities around the world invest more in public transport, he said.
Small and medium-sized enterprises such as Huebner make up the so-called Mittelstand, which accounts for 35% of corporate revenue and 58% of jobs in Germany. Often family-owned, they don’t have the cash buffers to sit out a downturn. Nor are they well-positioned to address structural challenges like a dramatic shift in the underpinnings of modern manufacturing.
“The SMEs are more-or-less sandwiched” between big companies and their customers, said Andreas Fehler, a spokesman for the Chemical Association of Baden-Wuerttemberg. “They deliver to the automotive or machinery industry, and these are the industries, well, we’ve seen in the last weeks how they’ve been holding up -- and this is a problem.”
The ultimate challenge facing German manufacturing is the transition to so-called Industry 4.0. The concept refers to the so-called fourth industrial revolution as manufacturers around the globe go digital. The aim is to combine robotics, machine learning, cloud computing, big data and the Internet of Things to create smart factories capable of better, more efficient production.
While Germany originated the term, the country is ill-equipped to deal with the transition, with deficiencies in everything from software training to Internet infrastructure.
Amid complaints about a lack of government support and a shortage of trained labor, the Mittelstand is falling behind on research and development efforts, according to a report by the Bavarian Chamber of Commerce. The state, home to BMW and Audi, only hit its goal of R&D outlays accounting for 3% of GDP thanks to spending by big companies.
Giving voice to mounting concerns over the country’s competitiveness, more than 50,000 people attended a June rally in Berlin organized by industrial union IG Metall. The goal was to prod the government to help prevent widespread layoffs from the technology shift.
While political issues such as Brexit and trade tensions are distorting measures such as the exchange rate and raw materials prices, making economic judgments “incalculable,” companies still need to look further into the future, according to Olaf Wortmann, an economic expert at the German Mechanical Engineering Industry Association.
“It’s pretty gruesome right now,” said Wortmann. “Merely waiting isn’t enough. You can prepare by trying to address all the technical challenges. But simply waiting won’t do it.”
Rubber to Lasers
For Huebner, that’s meant investing in lasers. The project -- far removed from the molding it’s done for decades -- started in 2014 with a series of acquisitions. The photonics unit now has 70 employees, with manufacturing locations in Stockholm and at its headquarters in Kassel and sales offices in Silicon Valley and the U.K. The company’s products are used for holographic films for augmented reality glasses and biomedical research.
Sales, which have doubled since the unit was established, are “growing like hell,” said Ingolf Cedra, Huebner’s managing director for materials and photonics.
He’s optimistic that Germany, which successfully rebuilt after the ravages of war and absorbed the communist east after the Berlin Wall fell 30 years ago, will ultimately weather the current turbulence.
“German industry has a fantastic chance in combining the mechanical expertise, in designing the machinery and merging that with clever software solutions,” said Cedra. “I do believe that the Mittelstand -- driven by machinery business, mechanical engineering -- they have a chance, and they will take the chance.”"
1417,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 23, 2019 12:52AM ET</span>","Asian petrochemical profits slammed by trade war crossfire, oversupply","By Seng Li Peng and Jane Chung
SINGAPORE/SEOUL (Reuters) - Profits from making petrochemicals in Asia have plunged to their lowest in months as the unrelenting trade conflict between Beijing and Washington stifles Chinese demand for chemicals and plastics just as waves of new production start to come on line.
The global output capacity for polyethylene, a key ingredient for plastics used in everything from piping to toys, is expected to exceed demand by 3 million tonnes by the end of 2020, compared to overcapacity of 545,000 tonnes in 2019, data from commodity consultancy Wood Mackenzie showed.
That comes as new production is set to crank up in China, South Korea and Malaysia, although the United States and the Middle East will account for more than half of the new volumes. 
""In the next two years, the operating rates (of polyethylene units) will be impacted as the capacity additions are faster than the demand addition,"" said U.S.-based Wood Mackenzie principal analyst Ashish Chitalia.
Though analysts say polyethylene profit margins are already at their narrowest in around seven years, ballooning supplies could drive them even lower - placing high-cost producers under critical pressure. 
The spread between prices for polyethylene and feedstock naphtha gives an approximation of how much profit petrochemical makers can make.
Based on data from the Korea Petrochemical Industry Association (KPIA), the average spread between high-density polyethylene (HDPE) and naphtha feedstock costs in the second quarter was $421.34 a ton - the lowest quarterly average since 2012. 
And the pressure is growing. The average spread for HDPE - used to make bottle caps, detergent tubs and piping - was down to $414 a ton in the week ended Aug. 16.

Meanwhile a plastic known as linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE), used in a host of products including food and non-food packaging, is similarly weak.
""The average LLDPE/naphtha spread for July was around $418 a ton and could fall below producer break-even levels of around $400 to $450 in 2020 due to long supplies,"" said Tan Yi Ling, principal analyst of polyolefins at IHS Markit based in Singapore. In January the spread was about $542, Tan said. 
SOUTHEASTERN COMFORT?
The year-long, tit-for-tat trade dispute between Washington and Beijing has roiled financial markets and cast a long shadow over the global economy.
China exported 12 million tonnes of its plastic end-products worldwide in 2018, 3 million tonnes of which went to the United States, said Wood Mackenzie's Chitalia.
But these plastics exports to the United States are now hit by tariffs, the analyst said, pushing some petrochemical companies to look for customers in new regions. 
Shin Hak Cheol, chief executive of South Korea's LG Chem (KS:051910), told reporters in July that South Korea's top chemical maker plans to tap markets in areas such as Southeast Asia to offset easing demand from plastics makers in China.
""The trade dispute between the U.S and China is not expected to end in the short term,"" he said. 
""Additionally, South Korean petrochemical makers expanded their facilities five years ago during a peak time in the petrochemical cycle, and some of those increased supplies have hit the market and will keep coming to the market in 2020.""
In the petrochemicals trade it typically takes four to five years from initial investments to start-up of commercial operation.
Meanwhile, Malaysia's state energy firm Petronas is expected to start up a 1.2 million tonnes-per-year ethylene facility in the south of the country later this year, looking to supply local markets.
""These new capacities illustrate the new paradigm confronting petchem (petrochemical) producers,"" said Paul Hodges of The pH Report, part of consultancy firm International eChem. ""Low-cost supply is no longer the key to success ... Sustainability is replacing globalization as the key driver for the industry.""

1418,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 23, 2019 12:30AM ET</span>",E-commerce Upstart Pinduoduo Wants its Data Back From Alibaba,"(Bloomberg) -- For years, Pinduoduo Inc. had little clue about the whereabouts of millions of parcels delivered every day to its shoppers’ doorsteps. Now it’s finally getting ready to take back control of that valuable data -- from  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA).
China’s No. 3 e-commerce platform has since its inception relied on much larger Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and its Cainiao unit to track and handle some $70 billion of annual shipments, meaning its rival enjoyed an unparalleled overview of PDD’s nationwide activity and customers’ shopping habits. That’s finally changing thanks to PDD’s new in-house shipping information technology, said David Liu, Pinduoduo’s vice president of strategy.
Beyond freeing itself from a dependence on its rival, PDD’s approach presents a threat to Alibaba’s dominance of Chinese e-commerce shipping data, mined by companies in industries from retail to healthcare for insights into consumer behavior. It’s a lead built starting back in 2014, when Cainiao pioneered a so-called e-waybill system that tracks goods via shipping labels, and that shares real-time locations. That innovation became the de facto standard, adopted by couriers from SF Express to ZTO and helping Alibaba’s own shopping sites operate more efficiently.
“It’s key for us to grasp this data,” PDD’s Liu said in an interview after the company unveiled stronger-than-expected quarterly results. “All the third-party logistics companies have welcomed us as another platform that brings some checks and balances in the industry.”

Pinduoduo has grown to such a scale it wants to wrest back its own logistics data. The shopping app -- known for cheap deals and gamified experiences -- is luring new users from China’s rising middle-class. In June, customers from Tier 1 and 2 cities contributed almost half of Pinduoduo’s gross merchandise volume, or value of goods sold, up from 37% in January. On Wednesday, it reported a 169% leap in revenue for the June quarter, triggering a 15% share surge.
PDD’s in-house system now hooks up and shares information, such as unique identifiers for individual products, between merchants, couriers and shoppers. In March, the Shanghai-based online retailer launched its own variant of Cainiao’s system and as of now, almost all orders generated on PDD’s platform -- an average of 40 million per day -- have migrated to the new system, Liu said.
“For any e-commerce platform, logistics is a very important part of creating a good shopping experience,” said Shawn Yang, a Shenzhen-based analyst with Blue Lotus Capital. “Pinduoduo wants to provide cheap delivery and better service, otherwise Alibaba will have a huge edge over it.”
Pinduoduo isn’t charging fees for its e-waybills for now. In the long run, Liu said, the company could monetize by helping merchants use Pinduoduo’s data to lower delivery costs. While Pinduoduo won’t build its own warehouses or fleet, it will invest in technologies like AI-powered routing to create an “asset-light” logistics network, PDD founder and chief executive Colin Huang told analysts on a conference call after announcing earnings."

Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index rose 0.5% by 10:40 PM ET (02:40 GMT). The city will likely face further anti-government protests this weekend, as multiple protests are reportedly being planned beginning later today.
The protests, which began in early June, have put the Asian financial hub into the biggest crisis since its handover to Beijing in 1997. The Hang Seng Index has plunged almost 3,000 points in the last couple of weeks.
China’s Shanghai Composite and the Shenzhen Component gained 0.6% and 0.2% respectively.
The Nikkei 225 traded 0.4% higher even after Japan and the U.S. failed to agree on a trade deal. Reuters reported that Japanese Economy Minister Toshimitsu Motegi and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Ligthizer held four hours of talks on Thursday, but decided to extend talks for another day.
The two sides were “getting close to reaching a conclusion,” Motegi told reporters. ""It's as expected but we're spending quite a long time,"" Motegi said of the negotiations, adding that he will meet with Lighthizer again on Friday.

1420,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 22, 2019 08:06PM ET</span>",FAA says it will invite global Boeing 737 MAX pilots to simulator tests,"By Tracy Rucinski and David Shepardson
CHICAGO/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration said on Thursday it would invite Boeing 737 MAX pilots from across the world to participate in simulator tests as part of the process to recertify the aircraft for flight following two fatal crashes.
Earlier, Reuters reported that the agency had asked the three U.S. airlines that operate the MAX to provide the names of some pilots who had only flown the 737 for around a year, including at least one MAX flight.
In a statement, the FAA said it had not specified the number of required hours of flight experience, but said the candidates would be a cross-section of line pilots and must have experience at the controls of the MAX. 
Boeing Co's (N:BA) latest 737 narrow-body model, the MAX, was grounded worldwide in March after two crashes within five months in Indonesia and Ethiopia that killed 346 people.
Boeing has been reprogramming software for a stall-prevention system at the center of both crashes, which the FAA must approve before the plane flies again commercially.
The FAA said it had not yet specified a firm schedule for the tests.
Boeing has said it is working toward getting the 737 MAX flying again commercially in the early fourth quarter. Reuters reported on Thursday that it had told suppliers it planned to ramp 737 production back up in February, sending its shares 4% higher. 
The world's largest planemaker slowed its 737 production rate in April because deliveries of the MAX, which makes up the bulk of its single-aisle production, were frozen under the grounding, hitting its supply chain and airline customers.
In the United States, MAX operators Southwest Airlines Co (N:LUV), American Airlines (O:AAL) and United Airlines (O:UAL) have had to cancel hundreds of daily flights as they wrestle with slimmer fleets at a time of strong domestic air travel demand.
The MAX is Boeing's fastest-selling aircraft, with about 5,000 pending orders.
As part of its own testing process, Boeing has invited senior airline pilots to experiment with the software fix and use simulators to run scenarios similar to the ones that led to the two crashes.
But sources told Reuters that the FAA also wanted to observe newer 737 pilots. One source said the simulator tests were supposed to be conducted during the first week of September but had been pushed back to the middle of the month.

The FAA, which is working alongside global regulators, has said repeatedly it does not have a fixed time line to approve the grounded jets to fly commercially again.

1421,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 22, 2019 07:29PM ET</span>","Hasbro takes home Peppa Pig, PJ Masks in $4 billion eOne deal","By Nivedita Balu
(Reuters) -  Hasbro Inc  (NASDAQ:HAS) will buy Entertainment One Ltd for about $4 billion (3.27 billion pounds) in cash, expanding into the lucrative infant and preschool market by gaining access to popular TV shows like Peppa Pig and PJ Masks.
The deal for the independent studio will give the Nerf and Power Rangers toymaker more exposure in its content media push, where it has been buying smaller firms and tying up with major movie studios to boost sales of toys linked to movie franchises.
Last year, it spent about $520 million to add children's entertainment and merchandising franchises, including the characters of the superhero TV show Power Rangers. 
Hasbro has also linked up with Paramount Pictures and Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) and has seen growth with Marvel's ""Avengers"" toys.
Chief Executive Officer Brian Goldner said Hasbro will leverage eOne's brands to expand opportunities globally. 
""The acquisition of eOne adds beloved story-led global family brands that deliver strong operating returns to Hasbro's portfolio and provides a pipeline of new brand creation driven by family-oriented storytelling,"" Goldner said. 
Peppa Pig, which brings in the bulk of revenue at eOne, is a popular show that is streamed on several platforms across the globe and has been grabbing more sales with the growing popularity of its toys and merchandise.
Jackie Breyer, group publisher at trade magazine 'the Toy Book', said the latest deal shows Hasbro's efforts to build its entertainment brands and not just toys. Breyer also highlighted Hasbro's foray into the United Kingdom being a bonus. 
""This is a huge deal,"" Breyer said.
Hasbro will pay 5.60 pounds per share, a premium of 26.4% to eOne's close of 4.43 pounds on Thursday. Hasbro will also finance the buy with debt and $1.0 billion to $1.25 billion in cash from equity financing, the companies said.
Hasbro sees annual run rate synergies of about $130 million by 2022, helped by savings from a portion of eOne's toy business in-house and improving the profitability of its licensing and merchandising activities. 
The deal is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2019.
Shares of Hasbro were down 5% in extended trading. 
Centerview Partners LLC is serving as financial adviser to Hasbro and Cravath, Swaine & Moore LLP, Stikeman Elliott LLP and Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer LLP are serving as its legal counsel.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Export-Import Bank said on Thursday its board intends to vote on a $5 billion direct loan for the development of a liquefied natural gas (LNG) project in Mozambique, the bank's biggest export financing deal in years.
The government export lender said it has notified the U.S. Congress of the transaction, which will be ready for a final board vote in 35 days.
If approved, the transaction would support U.S. exports of goods and services for the engineering, procurement and construction of the onshore LNG plant and related facilities on the Afungi Peninsula in northern Mozambique.
EXIM said over the five-year construction period the financing could support 16,400 American jobs among suppliers in Texas, Pennsylvania, Georgia, New York, Tennessee, Florida and the District of Columbia.
It estimated interest and fee income from the transaction of more than $600 million from a consortium led by Occidental Petroleum Corp (NYSE:OXY).'s recently acquired Anadarko Petroleum (NYSE:APC) Co.
U.S. exports to supply the project, however, face competition from financing offered by foreign export credit agencies.
The project would be the single biggest financing deal since EXIM's full lending powers were restored in May with the confirmation of three new board members. That ended a drought of nearly four years in which the bank could not approve loans and guarantees of more than $10 million due to a protracted fight in Congress over its future.
The bank, seen by some conservatives as providing taxpayer-backed ""corporate welfare"" and ""crony capitalism,"" was unable to finance major infrastructure projects like the Mozambique LNG plant and commercial aircraft built by Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co. It needs Congress to renew its charter before Sept. 30 to keep operating.
U.S. President Donald Trump's administration views the bank as a tool to boost U.S. exports in an increasingly competitive trade environment.
""This critical project is not only a win for American companies and workers, supporting over 10,000 jobs in the United States, but also for the people of Mozambique as well,"" U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said in a statement.
EXIM said the Mozambique LNG project would begin to develop the Rovuma Basin, one of he world's most extensive untapped reserves of natural gas, with a major impact on Mozambique's economy."

1425,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 22, 2019 06:36PM ET</span>","As Fires Rage in Amazon, Brazil Pushes Back Against Global Scorn","(Bloomberg) -- The Brazilian government is pushing back against mounting national and international pressure over its environmental policies as a record number of fires rip through the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) rain forest.
Environment Minister Ricardo Salles announced the creation of an Amazon task force in an interview with local news website UOL, while President Jair Bolsonaro’s senior foreign policy adviser tweeted a long English language thread defending Brazil’s record on Amazon deforestation and attacking media coverage. Meanwhile, house Speaker Rodrigo Maia said congress will set up a panel to study the fires.
Data from the National Institute of Space Research showed an 84% year-on-year increase in forest fires in 2019, many caused by loggers incentivized by the government’s disdain for environmental oversight. While Bolsonaro relishes criticism of his attitude toward the Amazon -- jokingly referring to himself as ‘Captain Chainsaw’ -- his supporters in the agricultural sector fear a backlash from consumers both in Brazil and abroad.
Germany and Norway have already suspended their contributions to a rain forest preservation fund, and polls indicate that even among Bolsonaro’s own voters there is overwhelming support for stronger measures to combat illegal deforestation.
“In terms of environmental management we’re witnessing a disaster,” Jairo Nicolau, a political science professor at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, said. “It’s not about just a different policy. We’re seeing total disorganization in an area in which there was a culture of continuity from one government to the next.“
Points of Concern
Salles’ decision to create an Amazon task force, comprising police, armed forces, indigenous, farming and mining groups represents a change in tack from the confrontational attitude he has taken to previous criticism of environmental policy. The announcement came the same day as a Brazilian Senator asked the Supreme Court to remove him from his position for failing to fulfil his duties.
Maia was clear in explaining the reasons behind his decision to establish a congressional committee to investigate the fires. “It is important to keep our agribusiness exports strong and to preserve the environment,” he wrote.
Senior figures in Brazil’s agricultural sector have warned the president of the potential economic repercussions of his policies, though so far Bolsonaro himself has shown little sign of paying heed. One of the key concerns is the possible impact on the recent trade deal agreed between the European Union and the South American customs union, Mercosur.
“The Mercosur-EU deal hasn’t been ratified yet and there are requirements in it about sustainability and the protection of the indigenous, for example,” Renata Amaral, director of international trade at the Barral MJorge consultancy, said. “The Bolsonaro government could start to see setbacks in the area he cherishes the most.”
’Spreading Lies’
On Thursday morning, a day after he had baselessly accused foreign NGOs of lighting fires to discredit his government, Bolsonaro instructed his Twitter followers to read a thread by his adviser, Felipe Martins.
In the 11-part post, Martins criticized the mainstream media’s “irresponsible disregard for basic data” and stated that over 60% of Brazil is covered by native vegetation, while only 29% is used for agriculture. Martins also wrote that Brazil has some of the most stringent environmental legislation in the world and has a larger share of territory under environmental protection than any other country worldwide. He adds that there is a “clear long-term, downward trend” in deforestation.
While the percentages of land used for agriculture and covered in vegetation Martins cites are roughly true, World Bank data show that there are at least 20 counties that maintain more forest as a proportion of their territory than Brazil, including Japan, Sweden and the Congo.
The statement’s omissions are also significant. Brazil is the country that deforests at a faster rate than any other, according to the research NGO World Resouces Institute."

1429,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 22, 2019 05:26PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch,"Investing.com - Here’s a preview of the top three things that could rock markets tomorrow.
1. Jackson Hole: All Eyes on Powell

The symposium of central bankers in Jackson Hole, Wyo., kicked off Thursday, but traders have been anxiously waiting for Fed Chairman Jay Powell's speech. 

Powell's remarks, scheduled to start at 10 AM ET (14:00 GMT), will likely provide fresh clues on monetary policy measures at a time when global bond yields are on the backfoot on expectations that central banks will ramp up stimulus.

At the same time, the Commerce Department reports new home sales in July. 

On average, economists expect that sales declined 0.2% in the month, but, on a seasonally adjusted basis, the annual rate rose to 686,000, from 646,000 in June, according to forecasts compiled by Investing.com. 
2. Oil Rig Count Rolls In

Traders will look to the latest rig count data due Friday for clues on crude production activity following an uptick in U.S. production to 12.3 million last week. 

Data last week showed the number of oil rigs operating in the U.S. fell by 4 to 770. The number is down 11.4% from a year ago.
The weekly rig count is an important barometer for the drilling industry and serves as a proxy for oil production and oil services demand.

Oil prices look set to end the week up slightly as expectations that central bankers will adopt easier monetary policy measures to prevent a slowdown in the global economy have calmed fears of a deeper slip in oil demand. 
3. Footlocker Earnings Due 

  Foot Locker   (NYSE:FL) is expected to report earnings of 67 cents a share on revenue of $1.82 billion before markets open on Friday. 

With the U.S. consumer showing little spending restraint, market participants are closely watching whether the athletic-apparel company will rebound with an earnings beat, after unexpectedly missing estimates in the previous quarter.

The litigation, which marked the latest skirmish in an ongoing battle between the board and the government over spending priorities, targets a law that transfers hundreds of millions of dollars in municipal pension and healthcare costs to the bankrupt Puerto Rico government.
U.S. District Court Judge Laura Taylor Swain rejected arguments by the island's government that the lawsuit cites faulty claims based on the 2016 federal PROMESA Act, which created the board and a bankruptcy-like process to restructure about $120 billion of Puerto Rico's debt and pension obligations. 
Swain, who is hearing the island's bankruptcy cases, ordered the lawsuit to proceed.
A fiscal 2020 budget passed by Puerto Rico lawmakers included funding for local pensions and health insurance costs to aid cash-strapped municipalities despite warnings from the board that so-called Law 29, which enabled the move, is inconsistent with its fiscal plan. 
The board's lawsuit seeks to void the law, contending it would impair the PROMESA Act by diverting hundreds of millions of dollars Puerto Rico's government could otherwise use to spur economic growth.
Law 29, which was enacted in May by then-Governor Ricardo Rossello, will add $311 million in additional government spending in fiscal 2020 and $1.7 billion through fiscal 2024, according to the lawsuit.
The oversight board sued Rossello and Puerto Rico's fiscal agency in July. Rossello resigned earlier this month in the wake of protests over government corruption and controversial leaked chat messages involving him and close allies. He was eventually replaced by Wanda Vazquez, Puerto Rico's justice secretary.
Following a meeting last week between Vazquez and a group of island mayors, the new governor vowed she will continue to defend the law's validity, according to Carlos Molina, president of the Mayors Federation.

(Reuters) - U.S. stocks turned lower on Thursday as the first contraction in the manufacturing sector in nearly a decade and uncertainty about future interest rate cuts overshadowed an initial boost from upbeat retail earnings.
IHS Markit said its ""flash"" survey on new orders for U.S. manufactured goods fell to 49.5 in August, over concerns whether the U.S.-China trade war would tip the economy into a recession. In response, yields on the U.S. two-year Treasury notes again moved above those of 10-Year bonds.
""Manufacturing has been pretty weak across the globe for a while now and we are starting to see that bleed into U.S.,"" said Joe Mallen, chief investment officer at Helios Quantitative Research. ""It's not unexpected, but definitely not good for prospects of our economy going forward.""
Adding to the downbeat mood, Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank President Patrick Harker said he does not see the case for additional stimulus, while Kansas City Federal Reserve Bank President Esther George said she does not yet see a signal of a downturn in the U.S. economy.
Their comments sent jitters through markets ahead of a highly anticipated speech by Fed Chairman Jerome Powell on Friday at an annual gathering of central bankers in Jackson Hole.
The release of the minutes from the U.S. central bank's meeting on July 30-31 offered little clarity on its next move. The policymakers were deeply divided over their quarter-point cut in rates, but united in wanting to signal the move was not on a preset path to further cuts.
Despite the stock market stabilizing from a rough first half of August, investors are wary about how far policymakers are willing to cut rates and Powell's remarks may prove crucial to short-term sentiment.
At 11:19 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) was down 7.34 points, or 0.03%, at 26,195.39, the S&P 500 (SPX) was down 8.07 points, or 0.28%, at 2,916.36. The Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) was down 48.87 points, or 0.61%, at 7,971.33.
Nine of the 11 major S&P sectors were lower with a 0.59% decline in technology (SPLRCT) weighing the most on the benchmark index. Interest-rate sensitive bank stocks gained as central bankers toned down expectations of aggressive rate cuts.

The Dow finished the day up 0.2%, or about 50 points. But Boeing's shares were up more than 4.3% and added nearly 98 points to the blue-chip index by itself.
At the same time, the S&P 500 slipped a very modest 0.05% and the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.36%.
Boeing) was surging because of its Tuesday announcement that it is marshaling a temporary workforce of several hundred workers to help get 737 Max jetliners back into service once the FAA and others agree that its fixes to the jet's problems will work.
Boeing thinks that the approval will come some time in the fourth quarter, perhaps by Thanksgiving. It might be early 2020 before the planes are in service again.
Boeing has an outsized effect on the Dow because, purely on a dollar basis, it is the blue-chip index's priciest stock. So, any big move in its shares has a huge effect on the average.
The rest of the stock market was marking time Thursday. Half the Dow stocks were higher, in fact.
Traders, money managers and investors seemed to be waiting for Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's speech at the Fed's annual symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyo. on Friday. What many investors - and President Donald Trump - want to hear is a signal the Fed will cut rates aggressively to preempt an economic slowdown. Powell, so far, has been reluctant to commit to a big rate cut.
Interest rates moved higher on the day, ahead of the speech. The key 10-Year Treasury yield rose to 1.617% from 1.577% on Wednesday.
The spread between the 10-year and 2-year yields slipped to 4.21 basis basis points from 4.3 basis points on Wednesday and inverted once again in morning trading. 
Oil prices were modestly lower. West Texas Intermediate crude fell 33 cents to $55.35 a barrel. Brent oil futures fell 38 cents to $59.92. Gold futures fell $7.20 to $1,508.50.
There were some negatives in the market. Nine of the 11 S&P 500 sectors were lower, with materials and health care stocks faring the worst. 
The IHS U.S. manufacturing index fell below 50 in July, suggesting a slowdown.
UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) fell 3.1% and is off 5% so far this week and 4.5% this quarter, despite a bullish second-quarter earnings report in July and strong guidance. The health-insurance giant's decline subtracted 50 points from the Dow. 
But Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN) shares led the S&P 500 with a 15.8% gain after second-quarter earnings were better than expected. Sales declined, however. "

1437,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 22, 2019 03:42PM ET</span>",StockBeat: Overstock Rallies as CEO Quits Days After Delivering Confession,"Investing.com - Chief executives and founders fall on their swords for any number of reasons, but the series of events that led   Overstock.com   (NASDAQ:OSTK) founder and chief executive Patrick Byrne to quit on Thursday may well be talked about for some time. 
Byrne resigned from the e-commerce company, just a week after conceding in an interview with Fox News that he ""assisted in what are now known as the Clinton investigation and the Russian investigation.""
Byrne’s resignation set off a big rally in shares in  Overstock.com  (NASDAQ:OSTK). The cloud of conspiracy hanging over Bryne would likely prove a distraction for the company going forward. Shares were up more than 10% Thursday afternoon. But it had a wild ride just getting there.
Explaining his decision to quit in a letter to investors, Byrne said coming forward was ""hardly my first choice,"" but felt that his presence could ""affect and complicate all manner of business relationships, from insurability to strategic discussions regarding our retail business.” 
He had admitted last week that he had been romantically involved with Maria Butina, the Russian operative who infiltrated American politics and is now serving an 18-month prison sentence for being an unregistered foreign operative. That news sent  Overstock.com  (NASDAQ:OSTK) Overstock shares plunging from the Aug. 9 close of $25.19 to as low as $15.46 over the next three days. 
And he said he conducted his affair while informing on it to the FBI. 
Byrne, who holds degrees from Dartmouth, Cambridge and Stanford, has been controversial in the past, deriding naked short sellers and others as he built up Overstock and, at the same time, becoming passionate about blockchains and crypto-currencies. Overstock began as an online retailer of surplus and returned merchandise. It does that and sells new merchandise as well.
Overstock's shares are actually up nearly 57% this year, but that was after plunging in 2018 from as high as $89 in the early part of the year.
Byrne's parting words also included some insight on the way forward for the company. 
“The best thing to do for shareholder interest is to use cash flow to mature our blockchain keiretsu firms to fruition while we keep running our Retail business focusing on refining it as an exquisite gem of a technology platform, rather than again trying to go head-to-head with any firm in the process of dropping billions of dollars in losses,” Byrne said.
Overstock said it would appoint Jonathan Johnson, an Overstock board member and president of Overstock’s blockchain subsidiary Medici Ventures, as interim CEO.
The e-commerce company also said Kamelia Aryafar, the chief algorithms officer, would become executive vice president of Overstock's retail business."

(Reuters) - Buyout firm KKR & Co Inc (N:KKR) is exploring a sale of Epicor Software Corp that could value the U.S. enterprise resource planning software provider at close to $5 billion, including debt, people familiar with the matter said on Thursday.
Companies such as Epicor that generate recurring revenue through business software sales have been popular targets for the private equity industry. The sources said that Epicor will likely attract interest from other buyout firms.
KKR is working with an investment bank on an auction for Epicor, the sources said, cautioning that no deal is certain and requesting anonymity because the matter is confidential.
KKR declined to comment, while Epicor did not respond to a request for comment.
Based in Austin, Texas, Epicor is a provider of application software to mid-sized companies in various retail, distribution and manufacturing sectors. It has 12-month earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of around $350 million, according to one of the sources.
KKR acquired Epicor from Apax Partners in 2016 for $3.3 billion, including debt. Apax acquired Epicor in 2011, taking it private, and merged it with another newly acquired technology peer, Activant Solutions Inc, in a $2 billion deal.
Under KKR, Epicor has been acquisitive, snapping up many small-business software vendors.
The software sector has been one of KKR's most prominent investment areas. Its previous deals include BMC Software, Exact Software, MYOB, Epicor, Onestream, iValua and Visma.
Some technology-focused private equity firms, such as Thoma Bravo LLC and Vista Equity Partners Management LLC, devote much of their funds to investments in business software firms."

(Reuters) - Overstock.com's stock (O:OSTK) surged 9% on Thursday after Chief Executive Officer Patrick Byrne resigned, saying distraction and fallout related to his involvement in a Federal Bureau of Investigation Russian espionage probe made it difficult for him to lead the online retailer.
His resignation follows a drop of over 30% in Overstock's shares over two days earlier this month, with investors rattled after Byrne claimed in a statement that he had secretly been involved with the FBI, starting in 2015.
The stock briefly surged 15% after the resignation announcement.
""While I believe that I did what was necessary for the good of the country, for the good of the firm, I am in the sad position of having to sever ties with Overstock, both as CEO and board member,"" Byrne said in a resignation letter addressed to shareholders on Thursday.
""It has been an honor to serve you through thick and thin, threats grand and arcane, for the past 20 years.""
In a letter to investors on Aug. 11, Byrne confirmed a report by Fox News contributor Sara Carter on her website https://saraacarter.com/russia-probe-twist-a-billion-dollar-ceo-a-convicted-russian-agent-and-the-fbi that he had a personal relationship with Maria Butina, a convicted Russian agent currently in a U.S. prison. Butina admitted to conspiring with a Russian official to infiltrate a gun rights group and influence U.S. conservative activists and Republicans.
In Byrne's Aug. 11 letter, which referred to the ""deep state,"" he said that starting in 2015 he assisted federal law enforcement officials, whom he called ""the Men in Black."" He said he was involved in probes ""about political espionage conducted against Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump.""
A libertarian with a doctorate in philosophy from Stanford University, Byrne for over a decade has publicly battled short sellers targeting his company as it competes against larger rivals, including Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) and eBay Inc (O:EBAY). He is known for making brash and freewheeling comments.
On Thursday, he lauded the remaining Overstock executive team with pop culture references, calling the chief marketing officer ""Commander Data,"" after a Star Trek character. He said another executive called an artificial intelligence system ""Skynet,"" after the Terminator movie series.
In a separate statement, Overstock said it appointed company veteran Jonathan Johnson as interim CEO.
Overstock is currently more targeted by short sellers than 99% of U.S. companies, according to Refinitiv. Total short bets against Overstock stand at $267 million, equivalent to almost 50% of its float, according to S3 Partners, a financial analytics firm.
Byrne is also a vocal proponent of blockchain technology and cryptocurrency.
In May, he lashed out at investors who questioned the motivation behind his sale of about 15% of his Overstock shares, saying he had to supplement his $100,000 a year salary and vowing never to ""give such an explanation again.""
The stock has fallen more than 70% from record highs in January 2018, when Overstock was benefiting from Byrne's plan to launch a digital token, and from hype around Bitcoin.
""On any normal day, my presence is not conducive to strategic discussions regarding our retail business. I believe that going forward my presence will definitely not be conducive to such strategic discussions,"" Byrne wrote in his resignation letter.

1442,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 22, 2019 02:16PM ET</span>","Exclusive: Boeing, grappling with uneven 737 supply chain, targets 52 per month in February - sources","By Eric M. Johnson
SEATTLE (Reuters) -  Boeing Co  (N:BA) has told suppliers it will resume production of its best-selling 737 jets at a rate of 52 aircraft per month in February 2020, then stepping up to a record 57 jets monthly in June, three people familiar with the matter told Reuters. 
Boeing told more than 100 suppliers during at least one Web meeting July 30 that the new schedule depended upon regulators approving the 737 MAX to fly again commercially in the fourth quarter, one of the people said. 
Shares of Boeing, the largest U.S. exporter with about 145,000 employees, were up 4.5 percent at $355.18. 
Boeing mainly builds the latest version of its cash-cow single-aisle family at its Seattle-area factory, but also builds a small number of earlier or military variants of the 737. 
One of the people expressed skepticism over the timing given the intense scrutiny from regulators that grounded the 737 MAX after deadly crashes killed nearly 350 people in Ethiopia and Indonesia in the span of five months. 
There is no guarantee when regulators will clear the 737 MAX to fly again, and Boeing Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg told analysts last month that Boeing would consider further 737 output cuts or potentially suspending production if the grounding dragged on. 
In April, Boeing cut the number of 737s it produces monthly to 42 from 52 after halting deliveries to airline customers, cutting off a key source of cash and hitting margins. 
Because the grounding happened when Boeing was going up toward record production levels, and each move of the sprawling supply chain has to be planned far in advance, Boeing and its suppliers are now caught between two conflicting pressures: preparing to get back on the upward path as soon as the plane is flying but also ratcheting downwards if regulators stall and the grounding continues for longer than expected. 
Boeing has been tight-lipped about its production plans.
Muilenburg told analysts last month that Boeing expects to be able to maintain its current monthly production rate of 42 aircraft, ""followed by incremental rate increases that would bring our production rate to 57 during 2020.""
Two persons familiar with Boeing's production plans, who spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity, said Boeing told suppliers it will increase production from 42 to 47 single-aisle aircraft per month in October, jibing with its guidance to investors on when it expects to win regulatory approval. It would then increase from 47 aircraft to the pre-crash rate of 52 aircraft per month in February 2020, the people, and a third person familiar with the plans, said. 
Boeing then would hit a record stride of 57 single-aisle jets per month in June 2020, two of the people said. 
In response to questions from Reuters, Boeing spokesman Paul Bergman said Boeing updated the 737 master production schedule to reflect timing assumptions for the 737 MAX return to service plan. 
""While the assumption reflects Boeing's best estimate at this time, the actual timing of return to service will be determined by the FAA and other global aviation regulatory authorities and could differ from this assumption and estimate.""
The current production plan represents a new delay as Boeing wrestles with the logistics of aligning a sprawling global supply chain with its high-volume assembly line in Renton, Washington. 
Rate changes by major manufacturers are usually incremental and communicated months or even years in advance, but the unprecedented challenge to the 737 program has forced Boeing to scramble, one of the people said. Boeing is eager to increase production because the higher rate means it can deliver more planes and get more cash. A higher rate also means Boeing pays less for parts.
Boeing organized at least one Web meeting on July 30 to inform suppliers that the original rate ramp plan - which Boeing decided in April would begin in August - was being delayed by three months, according to electronic materials described to Reuters by a person who attended. Different suppliers were shipping at different ""rate profiles"" and Boeing wanted to try to ""harmonize the supply chain,"" the person added.

CEO Guido Kerkhoff, under pressure after a fourth profit warning on his watch sent Thyssenkrupp shares to a 16-year low, has put a deal to buy Kloeckner at the centre of a turnaround plan he is working on, the newspaper reported.
""This objective is very concrete and has a good chance of being realised,"" one source familiar with the matter told Handelsblatt. Thyssenkrupp declined comment while no comment was immediately available from Kloeckner.
Kloeckner, whose shares are trading at decade lows under pressure from weakening industrial demand in Germany and abroad, has for months been the focus of speculation on a possible tie-up with Thyssenkrupp.
Gisbert Ruehl, Kloeckner's CEO, said in July he was open to playing a role in the consolidation of Thyssenkrupp's materials trading division, including taking a minority stake in it. 
Thyssenkrupp in May unveiled a major restructuring, effectively looking for partners for its business divisions, including Materials Services where it could sell a minority stake to a strategic partner.

So far, Kerkhoff has struggled to gain traction on his strategic initiatives even as Thyssenkrupp's financial health deteriorated, narrowing the scope to be acquisitive and raising pressure to liquidate assets, say analysts.

Financial markets have been volatile amid concern over global economic weakness and renewed U.S.-China trade tension. Minutes from the Fed’s July meeting showed Wednesday that officials viewed their cut last month as insurance against too-weak inflation and the risk of a deeper slump in business investment. Analysts expect Powell to suggest the central bank is ready to reduce rates further when he delivers his speech in Jackson Hole Friday.
“It’s just been news driven primarily based on trade wars and the Fed,” said Ed Clissold, chief U.S. strategist at Venice, Florida-based Ned Davis Research Inc. “Fundamentally there’s not a lot going on.

1452,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 22, 2019 12:56PM ET</span>",Wells Fargo pays $6.5 million to Navajo Nation over 'predatory' practices,"By Bryan Pietsch
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -  Wells Fargo  & Co (N:WFC) will pay the Navajo Nation $6.5 million to settle a lawsuit over ""predatory and unlawful practices"" by the bank, the Native American tribe said on Thursday.
The Navajo Nation sued Wells Fargo in federal and tribal courts in 2017, alleging the San Francisco-based bank had opened unauthorized accounts for vulnerable tribe members as part of the potentially millions of fake accounts opened by bank employees nationwide.
The settlement ""puts other companies on notice that harmful business practices against the Navajo people will not be tolerated,"" Navajo Nation President Jonathan Nez said in the statement, which referred to Wells Fargo's ""long campaign of predatory and unlawful practices.""
Wells Fargo said in a statement that the agreement demonstrates the bank's ""commitment to make things right regarding past sales practices issues.""
The settlement with the Navajo Nation followed a $575 million deal in 2018 with U.S. states over claims that Wells Fargo opened phony customer accounts and improperly referred and charged customers for financial products.
The settlement comes as Wells Fargo continues its attempt to overcome the fallout from its earlier practices. The bank said last year it had ""re-established"" itself, but has continued to face harsh criticism from politicians and consumer advocates.
The bank has seen two chief executives exit the firm in the wake of the series of scandals, and is still searching for a replacement for former CEO Timothy Sloan, who abruptly stepped down in March."
1453,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 22, 2019 12:51PM ET</span>","EU hopes to ease trade tension with U.S. at G7 summit, official says","BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union hopes to ease trade tensions with U.S. President Donald Trump when the leaders of the world's seven major advanced economies meet in France over the weekend, a senior EU official said on Thursday.
Transatlantic rifts are set to feature prominently when Trump arrives at the G7 summit in France to discuss differences over trade, Iran and climate change.
The EU said last month it would retaliate with extra duties on 35 billion euros' worth of U.S. goods if Washington imposes punitive tariffs on EU cars.
The Sino-U.S. trade war has also spurred fears of a broader global economic slump.
""We see trade tensions as the single most important risk factor to the growth of the global economy,"" the senior EU official said. The bloc would be seeking to defuse them and to concentrate on a ""positive"" EU-U.S. trade agenda.
Since the EU's chief executive, Jean-Claude Juncker traveled to Washington for trade talks with Trump a year ago, the bloc's imports of U.S. liquefied natural gas have tripled, while those of soybeans have doubled, according to the official.
""We can continue on that pathway where we also have an opportunity for both the U.S. and the EU to reach a deal on the elimination of industrial tariffs,"" the official said. If such an agreement is reached, the EU estimates that each side will generate an additional 26 billion dollars or euros in exports.
The EU would also prefer to resolve a dispute between aircraft manufacturers Boeing (N:BA) and Airbus (PA:AIR) without resorting to tariffs, the official said.
Separately, a Trump administration official told Reuters that Washington could agree a trade declaration in the French resort town of Biarritz with new British prime minister Boris Johnson, who will also be there and is making overtures to the U.S. president as Brexit looms.
""It wouldn't be an agreement on any trade issues. But it would be a statement about how to proceed, what the roadmap might be, what they were looking for from the trade negotiators and economic ministers,"" the senior White House official said.
Speaking on condition of anonymity, the official said that any such statement would signal determination on the part of the United States to support Britain through the Brexit process.
While Brexit marks an unprecedented rollback of European integration and has been a shock to the EU, Trump has praised it as an opportunity and offered warm words on Johnson himself, highlighting another fundamental disagreement straining the partnership between Washington and Europe."

1456,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 22, 2019 12:26PM ET</span>",Fuel supply to Air India stopped at six domestic airports: sources,"By Aditi Shah and Sudarshan Varadhan
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Jet fuel supply to state-run carrier Air India has been stopped at six domestic airports because of unpaid dues to fuel provider, Indian Oil Corp (IOCL) (NS:IOC), three sources said on Thursday.
""Jet fuel supply to Air India has been stopped for commercial reasons at six airports,"" a source at Indian Oil Corp told Reuters.
India, for years, has propped up the debt-laden airline by infusing equity to keep it alive - the government injected 39.75 billion rupees ($553 million) into Air India in the fiscal year that ended on March 31.
""In the absence of equity support Air India cannot handle the huge debt service liabilities,"" the airline said in a statement, adding its financial performance was improving.
Fuel supply to Air India has been halted since Thursday evening at six cities across the country including Mohali in the north, Vishakapatnam and Kochi in the south, Pune in the west and Ranchi and Patna in the east, one of the sources said.
India's aviation sector is facing turmoil with one of its biggest private carriers, Jet Airways (NS:JET) in bankruptcy, while passenger growth in the market overall has slowed.
The government failed last year in its attempt to sell a 76% stake in Air India due to a lack of interest from bidders who said they found some of the stake sale terms too onerous, making it a non-starter.
It is now redrawing the stake sale plans and as part of the effort it has hived off some of the loss-making airline's debt of $8.5 billion.
India may now consider selling up to a 100% stake in the airline, a government official told Reuters in July, adding that it expects to get 150 billion rupees ($2.1 billion) from selling the airline."

1461,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 22, 2019 11:16AM ET</span>","Coworking firm Industrious raises $80 million, sees profit in 2020","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Industrious, one of the largest U.S. coworking rivals of We Company's WeWork, said on Thursday it raised $80 million from investors and expects to turn a profit next year.
The announcement came a day after Knotel, another large flex-space operator, announced the completion of $400 million in financing.
Both investments reflect investor interest in operators of flexible workspace other than workspace provider WeWork, which is valued at $47 billion. Last week WeWork filed with regulators to go public, perhaps as early as next month.
WeWork could raise several billion dollars in its IPO, a key test of investor appetite for the fast-growing company that operates in 528 locations in 29 countries, but after nine years in business it still has not turned in a profit.
Demand has steadily grown for flexible office providers as they offer companies the ability to sign shorter-term leases than landlords typically are willing to provide. The model has been criticized for exposing a flex-space operator to a mismatch of its short-term revenue with long-term liability.
Industrious has now raised just over $220 million after the Series D round of investment from a retail unit of Brookfield Property Partners (O:BPY), fitness operator Equinox and Canada Pension Plan, a major component of Canada's retirement system.
""In a few months we'll be a profitable business,"" Jamie Hodari, co-founder and chief executive of Industrious, told Reuters.
He said that when Industrious signs a direct lease with a landlord, the profit margin is more than 30%, while less risky partnerships with landlords deliver a margin of more than 90%, albeit on less revenue.
New York developer TF Cornerstone and Plano, Texas-based Granite Properties also participated in the fund-raising round.
Cash flow in the first six months of this year covered 90% of Industrious' overhead and by the first quarter of 2020 should cover all of it, Hodari said.
The company has turned to revenue-sharing agreements in which landlords invest the majority of money for new locations. A more capital-efficient model will allow Industrious to speed up growth of its nation-wide network, it said in a statement.
Industrious expects to launch 80 locations in 45 U.S. markets by the end of this year, more than doubling the number of sites since it raised $80 million in February last year in a Series C round, the company said in a statement."

CHICAGO (Reuters) - China snapped up a small volume of U.S. soybeans last week after pledging to halt purchases of American farm products due to the escalating trade war between Washington and Beijing, U.S. Department of Agriculture data showed on Thursday.
The world's largest soybean importer struck deals from Aug. 9 to 15 to buy 9,589 tonnes for delivery in the current marketing year and 66,000 tonnes, approximately one cargo, for the next year, the data showed.
China's Commerce Ministry said on Aug. 5 that Chinese companies stopped buying U.S. farm products in the latest escalation of the trade war between the world's two largest economies.
""You do have some buying going on,"" said Arlan Suderman, chief commodities economist for INTL FCStone. ""It's a little bit of a surprise.""
China last year imposed retaliatory tariffs that remain in place on imports of U.S. farm products including soybeans and pork. The duties have slashed exports of U.S. crops and prompted the Trump administration to compensate American farmers for losses over two years with as much as $28 billion.
China said on Thursday it hopes the United States will stop a plan to impose new tariffs, adding that any new duties would lead to a further escalation.
China has largely turned to South America for soybeans since the trade war began last year. U.S. soybean sales to China in 2018 dropped 74% from the previous year.
""Compared to what they used to buy, they essentially have halted - but some have gotten through,"" Suderman said.
The sales of 9,589 tonnes for delivery in the current marketing year will probably be rolled ahead to be delivered in the next year, which begins on Sept. 1, said Don Roose, president of Iowa-based broker U.S. Commodities.
The cargo sold for delivery in the next marketing year could have been in the works before Beijing said Chinese companies would suspend purchases of U.S. farm goods, said Terry Reilly, senior commodity analyst for Futures International.
""The government may have just given the green light to say, 'Let this one go through,'"" Reilly said. 

""One cargo is not going to change the fact that they're not buying millions of tons of soybeans.""

(Reuters) -  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) on Thursday named Steven Armstrong president of the Changan Ford joint venture in China to deepen the alliance and push for more models, as the U.S. carmaker tries to stem a decline in sales in the world's second largest economy.
Sales of the joint venture with Chongqing-based Changan Automobile (SZ:000625) continued to decline in July. In the first seven months of this year, the venture's sales dropped more than 60% compared to the same period a year earlier.
Ford's overall sales dropped 37% in 2018 in the world's top auto market, mainly due to a lack of new products. Over the next three years, it plans to launch more than 30 new models in China, of which over a third will be electric vehicles.
The venture is also planning to revamp some of its existing manufacturing facilities to localise production of Ford's premium brand Lincoln. This would have a planned annual capacity of 70,000 Corsair sport-utility vehicles including 12,000 plug-in hybrid variants, according to a document on Chongqing city authorities' website.
""Steve's leadership will help us further strengthen the Changan Ford JV as we bring more new vehicles to the China market, including our first global all-electric small SUV,"" Ford Chief Executive Officer Jim Hackett said. 
Armstrong, the current chairman of Ford Europe, will begin his new role on Oct. 1, and report to Ford China President and CEO Anning Chen.
Armstrong replaces Nigel Harris, who will retire at the end of 2019 after more than three decades with the U.S. automaker.
In China, Ford also makes cars through Jiangling Motors Corp Ltd (JMC) (SZ:000550) which it has a stake in. It has said it would partner with Zotye Automobile Co Ltd (SZ:000980) to sell lower priced cars, but there seems not much progress.
According to U.S. consulting firm AlixPartners, 2018 capacity utilisation rates at China assembly plants operated by Ford were below 50%. Normally, rates of around 70-75% are considered the break-even threshold.

PARIS (Reuters) -  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) plans to cut around 500 jobs at its securities services arm in France, a union representative said on Thursday, as the bank seeks to reduce costs and retain competitiveness.
France's biggest bank said all job cuts at BNP Paribas Securities Services would be through voluntary redundancies over the next three years. Some of the posts will relocate to Portugal, said Joel Debeausse, deputy national delegate for the SNB union at BNP Paribas.
""It is part of a preservation of BNP Paribas Securities Services' competitiveness, which faces an increased pressure from world competition and low interest rates,"" the bank said in a statement.
BNP Paribas Securities Services offers asset services and custodian services to asset managers.
In February, BNP Paribas announced a 350 million euros cost-cutting plan on its corporate and investment banking division, which comprises securities services, after a weak fourth quarter. The business has improved in the first half of the year, but Yann Gerardin, head of corporate and investment banking, has said it would remain under pressure.
Big European banks such as BNP Paribas have relied more on volatile corporate and investment banking after years of rock-bottom interest rates have limited returns in retail banking.
As part of the cost-cutting program, BNP Paribas has sold off or closed unprofitable or subscale businesses, as it has already done with proprietary trading and U.S. commodities.
BNP Paribas has previously announced plans to cut jobs in other units including its retail banks in Belgium and Poland."
1467,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 22, 2019 09:26AM ET</span>","As U.S. watchdog retreats, mortgage firms reprise cozy marketing arrangements","By Katanga Johnson and Michelle Price
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. mortgage firms are getting back into joint marketing and advertising arrangements, reviving a controversial practice that was effectively banned in the aftermath of the 2007-2008 subprime mortgage crisis.
Such arrangements involve mortgage originators and title insurers, hungry for sales leads, paying a real estate broker or homebuilder to promote their services and products, or to rent a desk in their offices.
They were effectively banned by the Obama administration under the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's then director, Richard Cordray. He brought more than two dozen enforcement actions, including against big banks like JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co, alleging the arrangements violated federal laws that bar kickbacks or referral fees that could increase the cost of buying a home.
In interviews, nearly two dozen lawyers, consultants and mortgage executives told Reuters that the CFPB's sharp pullback under the Trump administration has emboldened the industry to get back into these arrangements.
""I have seen a significant jump in the number of banks, mortgage lenders and title companies who have gotten back into co-marketing/advertising arrangements because the regulatory environment has shifted,"" said Marx Sterbcow, a mortgage lawyer and managing attorney at New Orleans-based Sterbcow Law Group.
Cordray aggressively enforced the 1974 Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA), which bars giving or receiving anything of value in exchange for referrals for homebuying services such as mortgages, title insurance and appraisals.
While co-marketing arrangements are not illegal under RESPA, Cordray found many were used to disguise an illegal referral fee as compensation for marketing or advertising services.
""My view is about the same as it was when I was at the bureau. A lot of arrangements... are questionable at best, but probably illegal,"" Cordray told Reuters.
Republicans said Cordray overstepped the law and note that the courts did not always back his interpretation. After taking over as acting head of the CFPB, Mick Mulvaney said the agency would not take such an aggressive stance.
He pulled two high-profile RESPA suits Cordray had been fighting in court against mortgage lender PHH Corp. and law firm Borders & Borders. Under Cordray, the CFPB initially lost those suits, but Mulvaney departed from the bureau's usual practice by choosing not to fight those rulings. Mulvaney also closed Cordray's three-year RESPA probe of online real estate giant Zillow's (O:ZG) co-marketing program.
Overall, CFPB enforcement actions have fallen by around half under the Trump administration, a Reuters analysis found. ""All of those moves together sent industry the message that the agency wouldn't be aggressively pursuing RESPA enforcement as it had been in the past,"" said Richard Horn, partner at Garris Horn in Arizona and a former CFPB lawyer.
Online CFPB complaints and industry chat rooms reveal frustration among industry executives who claim competitors are unfairly exploiting the more relaxed regulatory environment.
""I know that the CFPB is now essentially gutted and will probably ignore my complaint, but I challenge you to do the right thing,"" said one anonymous complaint claiming a RESPA violation.
The CFPB declined to comment, but Kathy Kraninger, the new CFPB director, told Reuters in April the agency is reviewing RESPA enforcement and may publish new recommendations.
TRUMP 'WIN'
Because the marketing arrangements are private, there is no data on their use, although Reuters identified dozens online.
Mark Meyer, chief executive of mortgage services consultancy MLinc, said he had added around 75 new clients looking for help drafting co-marketing agreements since January 2018, compared with no new clients the previous year. He added that the Trump administration has been ""a win"" for mortgage firms.
Industry executives say these arrangements help homebuyers by guaranteeing them a pre-approved rate that allows them to expedite a purchase. But consumer groups say they can result in borrowers being steered toward more expensive mortgages.
""Consumers are often robbed of the experience to shop around by pledging their business to one provider on the spot, often unknowingly agreeing to pay higher fees,"" said Linda Jun, counsel at Americans for Financial Reform.
CFPB research from 2015 found that almost half of mortgage borrowers fail to shop around, costing them several thousand dollars over the life of a loan. A third of borrowers said they relied on their real estate agent for mortgage information.
The agency's overhaul has coincided with a period of intense competition in the U.S. mortgage market due to falling home sales. This competitive pressure has also made such arrangements more attractive.
Several industry executives, however, said firms had been uncomfortable getting back into such arrangements until the regulatory risk had abated.
""The risk of compliance was so great under Cordray that lenders had to wear both a belt and a pair of suspenders,"" said Josh Weinberg, who oversees compliance at New Jersey-based lender First Choice Loan Services.
""Now there's a loosening up on some of the risk in (marketing services agreements). We are more willing to consider them, especially with the recent changes at the bureau."""

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - With India's auto sales declining for the ninth straight month in July, more automotive manufacturers are laying off workers and temporarily halting production to keep costs in check, according to sources and documents seen by Reuters.
Japanese carmaker Toyota Motor (T:7203) and South Korea's  Hyundai Motor  (KS:005380) are the latest in a string of companies to halt production at plants to combat slumping sales, according to company memos to employees, reviewed by Reuters.
Passenger vehicle sales in July fell at the fastest pace in nearly two decades. The sales declines have triggered major job cuts in India's auto sector, with many companies forced to shut down factories for days and axe shifts.
Sources have told Reuters that even more companies have now begun to lay off temporary workers as the slowdown worsens.
Denso Corp's (T:6902) India unit, which makes powertrain and air-conditioning systems for cars, has laid off about 350 temporary workers at its Manesar plant in north India, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters.
Bellsonica, which is part-owned by India's biggest carmaker Maruti Suzuki (NS:MRTI) and makes fuel tanks and brake pads, has also let more than 350 workers go in Manesar, two sources said.
Denso did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Bellsonica could not immediately be reached.
Reuters earlier this month reported automakers, component manufacturers and dealers had already cut 350,000 jobs.
In a meeting with India's finance ministry on Aug. 7, industry executives asked for tax cuts, and easier access to finance for dealers and buyers, in an effort to revive sales.
Toyota, in a notice dated Aug. 13, told its workers the company would halt production at its plants in Bengaluru in southern India on Aug. 16 and 17 ""due to low market demand of vehicles"" and high stock of about 7,000 vehicles.
N. Raja, deputy managing director, at Toyota's India unit, told Reuters that while the company had a flexible production system it had to resort to five no-production days in August to prevent the build up of stock.
""The industry is deeply concerned with the reality of poor customer sentiment faced by the sector,"" said Raja, adding he hoped the government would step in to support the industry.
Hyundai, in a memo on Aug. 9, also said it would halt production for several days in August across various departments including the body shop and paint shop as well as its engine and transmission plants.
A Hyundai Motor India spokesman said the company expected sales to pick up in the festive season starting next month."

1472,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 22, 2019 08:42AM ET</span>",Factbox: Walmart and Tesla fought in private long before solar lawsuit,"(Reuters) - Walmart Inc (N:WMT) has sued Tesla Inc (O:TSLA), accusing it of ""years of gross negligence and failure to live up to industry standards"" that led to several fires at its stores with Tesla solar systems.
Walmart hired SolarCity to install solar panel systems on at least 244 of its stores. Tesla bought SolarCity in 2016, and Walmart alleges that Tesla did not fix the problems it inherited and was negligent itself.
Tesla has not responded to requests for comment or filed a response to the lawsuit. In Walmart's August 20 filing, though, the U.S. retailer describes its view of how the fight developed over several years.
The following is a timeline based on Walmart's lawsuit:
2010-2016
Walmart signs at least 244 contracts for solar systems with the company later bought by Tesla.
August 2012-2017
Tesla solar panels cause fires at Walmart stores in Long Beach, California, Milpitas, California and Lakeside, Colorado. They are not treated as related or systematic problems.
March-May 2018
Walmart stores in Beavercreek, Ohio, Denton, Maryland and Indio, California experience roof fires. Hours before the Indio fire started, Tesla had dispatched personnel to the store; Walmart believes this was to attend to a possible alert.
Walmart and Tesla begin joint inspections of sites lasting until December 2018.
Over the course of Walmart inspections it says it finds hotspots in solar panels' cracked sheets, compromising electrical insulation. It blames Tesla for failing to properly 'hire, train and supervise' its contractors.
It found Tesla put wires near sharp points and metal edges, used incorrect connectors that built up heat and failed properly to tighten connectors, used plastic tools with insufficient strength and plumbing tools, and improperly grounded systems, and kept poor records. During inspections, Walmart said, Tesla searched for problems with drones that lacked sufficient resolution to find panel ""hotspots"" and put tape on hotspots which exacerbated heat buildup.
By August 2019, Walmart says it received 29 inspection reports from Tesla itself. Those identified 157 ""action items"", 48 of which Tesla characterizes as ""reflecting conditions that rendered the sites unsafe or potentially unsafe"". Issues include improper wiring, poor grounding, broken solar panels with 'hotspots"".
May 31-June 1, 2018
Walmart demands Tesla disconnect all of the solar systems, says that agreements materially breached. Tesla responds that it did not breach contract but agrees that it would be ""prudent"" to disconnect, inspect and fix systems. It subsequently disconnects the systems.
November 29, 2018 
Walmart discovers a roof fire from a disconnected solar panel system on a store in Yuba City, California, due to sparking wires after insulation degrated.
Walmart says Tesla did not inform it about a ground fault alert it received between June 5 and Sept. 11, that year, at the same store. Walmart said such issues revealed Tesla's ""utter incompetence or callousness, or both."" 
January 2019
Tesla tells Walmart it has significantly enhanced its inspection protocols and begun a renewed series of site inspections aimed at reconnecting solar systems.
July 2019
Walmart concludes that Tesla is not doing what is needed to ensure safety. It sends its second notice of breach of contract and gives it 30 days to fix. Tesla responds to Walmart with what the retailer called ""unsubstantiated allegations"", says fires were ""regrettable"" and that some issues did exist. It says it is willing to satisfy most of the requirements by Walmart.
Walmart concludes its plan is ""boilerplate"" and falls short.
August 2019

Walmart and Tesla trade letters. On Aug 20, Walmart files lawsuit against Tesla in New York State Supreme Court. It says: ""Tesla has not reacted with the urgency that one would expect from a company that had installed solar panels that were catching on fire. Far from it: Tesla's cavalier responses have only confirmed Walmart's worries that its contractual counterparty is incapable of providing maintenance and inspection services sufficient to ensure the safety of Walmart's customers, employees, and property"".

1474,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 22, 2019 08:29AM ET</span>",Europe’s Banks Eye Breaking Last Taboo With Negative Interest Rates,"(Bloomberg) -- Five years after Mario Draghi turned the world of European banking upside down, lenders are considering breaking a last taboo: Negative interest rates for the masses.
Banks have long tried to pass on the cost of negative rates to corporations and wealthy individuals, but they’ve shied away from making regular folks pay to have money in the bank. Yet after Draghi, the European Central Bank’s president, signaled that rates could go even lower, executives at Banco Sabadell SA and  Commerzbank AG  (DE:CBKG) are saying they can’t rule out charging retail clients for deposits. Some bankers are even more sanguine in private.
“With a change of paradigm like the one we’re experiencing, you could say that it could be contemplated,” Jaime Guardiola, Sabadell’s chief executive officer, said of negative rates for retail clients. “There’s still some margin for error before this happens, but it could be envisioned.”
The question is, who will go first? Banks fear that whoever breaks that last taboo will suffer reputational damage and a large-scale client exodus. In a sign of just how contentious the issue is, particularly in a country of savers like Germany, the issue of negative rates on deposits has exploded onto the front pages of the country’s largest tabloid, and at least one top politician is calling for a ban.
Negative rates are a double whammy for banks, costing them more than 7 billion euros ($7.8 billion) a year for depositing funds overnight with their central bank, while at the same time eroding income from lending. That has pushed the share prices of many European lenders to record lows, and has left firms such as  Deutsche Bank  AG (DE:DBKGn) and Commerzbank reeling from falling revenue and shrinking profitability.
Until now, banks have responded by slashing costs and seeking to bolster fees from services other than lending. They’re also trying to hedge the cost of holding cash, but such moves carry the risk of creating a feedback loop that leads to still lower bond yields.
After cutting thousands of jobs with no end in sight, even a bank like Commerzbank -- which has lured more than a million new clients by handing out cash to anyone opening an account -- is entertaining the idea of eventually passing on the ECB’s punitive rates, even if it’s hypothetical for now.
“If there’s a market trend of negative rates being passed on to clients, we will have to look at that,” Chief Financial Officer Stephan Engels told reporters this month. “If we were swamped with deposits as a consequence, we’d have to examine very closely how we could deal with that sensibly.”
Banks are already making companies pay for large cash balances, and wealth managers such as UBS Group AG and  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Group AG are increasingly doing it for rich customers with unusually high cash holdings. There are even some retail banks -- mostly smaller and regional lenders -- charging for balances that exceed thresholds of as little as 100,000 euros, though often such penalties are only discussed on a case-by-case basis.
But by and large, banks haven’t passed on negative rates to regular folks, for fear losing too many deposits, which are a major source of funding. Changing that would also expose them to bad press. Bild, the largest German tabloid, has run front page stories this month warning that small savers’ deposits are no longer safe from penalty rates.
On Wednesday, Bavarian Prime Minister Markus Soeder told Bild that his party will put forward a policy initiative in Germany’s upper house of parliament to institute a negative-rate ban on retail deposits up to 100,000 euros ($109,000). The move is supposed to send a message to Draghi’s successor at the ECB, Christine Lagarde, he said.
Message to Lagarde
“The federal government should make clear that negative interest rates aren’t a sensible way forward,” Soeder, who also heads the Bavarian sister party of Angela Merkel’s Christian Democrats, told the paper. “They set a completely wrong signal and lead to a running down of savings.”
Germany’s banking lobby groups pushed back on Thursday, issuing a joint statement condemning a ban and warning that such a move could destabilize financial markets. The finance ministry is examining whether a ban would be in compliance with the constitution.
In the Nordic region, where sub-zero rates have been the norm longer than most other places, the issue is also gaining prominence. Sampo Oyj, the Finnish holding company that owns about 20% of Nordea Bank Abp, has urged lenders to change their attitude to the issue. Only when the finance industry acknowledges this will the ECB’s efforts to pump stimulus into the economy really work, Kari Stadigh, the chief executive officer of Sampo, said in a recent interview.
While bank executives might agree with the public criticism of negative interest rates, they have little room to offset even more punitive rates after five years in which the ECB tried to force savers to spend. Several have urged the ECB to consider exemptions from at least some of the charges for holding deposits, through a process known as tiering.
“I could imagine that many banks in the long run won’t be able to avoid passing on extra costs to a broader clientele,” said Hans-Walter Peters, head of the Association of German Banks, in a recent interview.
Even if they’re thinking about negative rates for savers, however, bankers are hesitant to discuss it in public for fear of irking antitrust authorities, who might see that as an effort to get peers on board.
“We once had a remark from competition authorities that they don’t like financial institutions actually to guide too much,” Kees van Dijkhuisen, the CEO of ABN Amro Bank NV, told analysts on a conference call this month. “That’s actually why we are cautious with respect to saying we go into negative territory.”"

LONDON (Reuters) - Share markets flatlined on Thursday as uncertainty over the outlook for U.S. interest rate cuts following the release of minutes from the Federal Reserve's last policy meeting kept investors on edge.
The Chinese yuan's slump to an 11-year low also sapped their appetite for risk, with dealers saying state-owned banks were seen selling dollars to support the yuan.
The MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, was down 0.1%. In Europe, the Euro STOXX 600 fell 0.1% in choppy trade, following a 0.5% drop in MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan.
Wall Street futures gauges were flat. 
Minutes of the Fed's July meeting showed deep splits among policymakers over whether to cut interest rates last month, though there was some unity in wanting to signal it was not on a preset path to looser policy.
The Fed cut rates by 0.25% in July. While a ""couple"" of Fed members supported a deeper cut of half a percentage point, ""several"" favored no change at all.
That reluctance to loosen policy seems at odds with the expectations for a cut of over 100 basis points by the end of 2020 that are already priced into markets.
Market players said that the minutes reflected a dissonance between expectations for cuts - fueled by geopolitical concerns such as U.S.-China trade tensions and economic weakness in major economies such as Germany - and the apparently solid fundamentals of the U.S. economy. 
""The update last night was a bit of a reality check - maybe don't get ahead of yourself on what the Fed is going to do,"" said David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets. 
""If you forget about the geopolitical headlines, forget about what the bond markets are doing, and look at the underlying indicators of the U.S. ... people are in jobs, earning decent money, and more importantly spending money."" 
Indeed, the apparent strength of the world's biggest economy was on display on Wednesday, where Wall Street basked in surprisingly upbeat results from retailers that sent  Target  (NYSE:TGT) surging 20% and Lowe's Cos up 10%.
But beyond the United States, worries about the fragility of the global economy were evident in data from Europe on Thursday.
Germany's private sector continued to struggle in August, suggesting further that Europe's largest economy is heading for a recession after its economy shrunk between April-June.
Euro zone business growth expectations also fell to their weakest in more than six years on trade war fears, even as the expansion picked up a touch in August.
YUAN AT LOWEST SINCE 2008
The Fed minutes raised the stakes for Chairman Jerome Powell's speech on Friday at the Fed's annual policy retreat in Jackson Hole, Wyoming - an event that investors are waiting for with bated breath. 
U.S. President Donald Trump has been urging larger rate reductions, with proponents of looser policy pointing to the need to lift inflation toward the Fed's target and thwart fallout from global trade tensions.
And those trade worries played out again in currency markets, where the fall in China's yuan to 7.0752 per dollar, its lowest since March 2008, promoted a rush to perceived safe-haven assets such as the Japanese yen.
Against the dollar, the yen advanced by 0.2% to 106.41 yen, nearing last week's eight-month low of 105.05 yen.
Currency traders said that while the Chinese economy's slowing growth meant pressure had been building on the renminbi from long before, the new fall suggested Beijing was prepared to use the currency as leverage as trade tensions simmer.
""This indicates that this is an instrument of the Chinese government in the trade war. It is allowing for renminbi weaknesses,"" said Thu Lan Nguyen, FX strategist with Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) in Frankfurt.
""It is an indication that they are expecting the trade war to continue, to last longer than they anticipated last year.""
In commodities, oil prices dipped on worries about the global economy and bigger-than-expected buildups in oil product inventories in the United States, the world's biggest oil consumer.

Brent crude futures rose 0.3%, or 18 cents, to $60.48, while U.S. crude gained 23 cents to $55.91 a barrel.

1479,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 22, 2019 06:44AM ET</span>","Fed Needs Rate Cuts to Plug Repo Black Hole, Credit Suisse Says","(Bloomberg) -- The Federal Reserve needs to cut rates further to address a looming funding squeeze in U.S. money markets being fueled by foreign central bank demand for its reverse repurchase agreements, according to  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Group AG.
Usage of the foreign repo pool -- where central banks invest cash with the New York Fed at rates comparable to money-market repo rates -- is close to $100 billion so far this year, driven by haven flows, strategist Zoltan Pozsar wrote in a research note Wednesday. It could hit $200 billion by year-end, exacerbating a glut in collateral caused by $800 billion in Treasury supply and driving up short-term funding costs.
Pressure caused by this “supermassive black hole” would seep into the foreign exchange forward, cross-currency basis and Libor-OIS markets, according to the note.
“Because inflows into the facility sterilize reserves and add collateral to the financial system, they worsen the collateral surplus,” Pozsar wrote. “When banks are at their intraday liquidity limits it means that every penny that flows into the facility makes it harder for banks to fund dealers.”
Rate Shopping
Thanks to the trade war and inverted U.S. yield curve, central banks attempting to weaken their currencies are making use of the RRP pool rather than buying Treasuries as they did in the past, Pozsar said. “Central banks are rate shopping and an uncapped foreign RRP facility is what enables that.”
A series of rate cuts to steepen the U.S. yield curve and incentivize them to switch back to currency-hedged Treasuries would help solve the problem, rather than a technical fix, such as a standing repo facility or asset purchases that could lead to Treasury monetization, according to Pozsar.
What is required is rate cuts “aggressive enough to re-steepen the curve so that dealer inventories can clear” Pozsar said. “Monetizing record deficits is likely not what this FOMC wants to be remembered for.”
Investors fully expect another rate cut at the Fed’s Sept. 17-18 meeting and further easing this year. A big clue could come from Chairman Jerome Powell when he speaks on Friday at the Kansas City Fed’s annual policy retreat in Jackson Hole, Wyoming."

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong banks published full-page newspaper ads calling for law and order in the Chinese-ruled city and international jewelers sought the rescheduling of a huge trade fair as weeks of pro-democracy protests showed no sign of let-up on Thursday.
Thousands held a scrappy anti-government protest on Wednesday at a suburban subway station where demonstrators were attacked by a mob of white-shirted men last month. Protesters at the subway station on Wednesday were angry that nobody had yet been prosecuted for that violence.
Police said they charged two men with rioting on Thursday in connection with the July attack. They will appear in court on Friday.
Wednesday's standoff stopped short of recent intense clashes, including the storming of the legislature and occupation of the airport, with police refrained from using tear gas or attempting to storm protesters' lines. Police said they arrested two men for unlawful assembly.
HSBC,  Standard Chartered  (LON:STAN) and Bank of East Asia all urged the restoration of order in the former British colony, which returned to Chinese rule in 1997.
""Oppose violence, restore social order, safeguard Hong Kong's status as an international financial centre,"" Standard Chartered wrote.
Trade representatives of the world’s largest diamond trading centers, from Mumbai, Antwerp and Ramat Gan, asked the organizer of the Hong Kong Jewellery and Gem Fair to postpone the high-profile event, which typically welcomes more than 54,000 visitors.
The fair is due to be held in September at the Asia World Exposition center and the Wan Chai Convention and Exhibition center.
In a letter to organizer Informa Markets, the representatives said between 30% and 40% of exhibitors were demanding to pull out.
“In light of recent events, we urge Informa Markets to consider the following; rather than potentially risking an empty show in terms of both visitors and exhibitors, postpone the show to a later date - as yet to be determined - once Hong Kong is in a more stable climate,"" the representatives wrote.
""Additionally, we request financial compensation in the form of a discount or refund for all participating companies.""
AIRPORT 'STRESS TEST'
Anger erupted in Hong Kong in June over a now-suspended bill that would allow criminal suspects in Hong Kong to be extradited to mainland China for trial but have since grown into one of the biggest populist challenges faced by Chinese President Xi Jinping since he took power in 2012.
The unrest has been fueled by broader worries about the erosion of freedoms guaranteed under the ""one country, two systems"" formula adopted after 1997 but not enjoyed on the mainland, including an independent judiciary and the right to protest.
Several anti-government demonstrations are planned in coming days and weeks, including a rally by hundreds of high school students on Thursday and a ""stress test"" of the airport at the weekend.
""Go to the airport by different means, including MTR, Airport Bus, Taxi, Bike and Private Car to increase pressure on airport transport,"" protesters wrote online.
The protests are already exacting a toll on Hong Kong's economy and tourism, with the financial hub on the verge of its first recession in a decade. 
Bookings on Australia's Qantas airline to Hong Kong have fallen by about 10% because of the protests and it plans to cut capacity by 7% in the next few months by using smaller planes, chief executive Alan Joyce told reporters.
Standard Chartered said in Thursday's newspaper notices the bank supported the government in upholding social order and guarding ""the status of Hong Kong as an international financial center"". 
HSBC said all parties must resolve disagreement through communication rather than violence. Neither HSBC nor Bank of East Asia referred to the government in their advertisements.
Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam reiterated on Tuesday that the extradition legislation was dead but has stopped short of officially withdrawing the bill, as protesters have demanded.
Demonstrators are also calling for an independent inquiry into the protests and perceived police brutality, a halt to descriptions of the protests as ""rioting"", a waiver of charges against those arrested, and resumption of political reform.
Beijing has reacted sharply to the protests and accused foreign countries, including the United States, of fomenting unrest. China has also sent clear warning that forceful intervention is possible, with paramilitary forces holding drills in neighboring Shenzhen.
China confirmed on Wednesday that a Chinese national working at Britain's Hong Kong consulate has been detained in Shenzhen for violating the law, likely worsening already strained ties between Beijing and London.

U.S. President Donald Trump over the weekend warned against a crackdown in Hong Kong like Beijing's suppression of pro-democracy protests in Tiananmen Square (NYSE:SQ) in 1989, which would make reaching a deal he has been seeking to end a trade war with China ""very hard"".

Long regarded as not a major risk issue for Nordic banks, money laundering has become a major concern in the last two years following scandals at competitors  Danske Bank  (CO:DANSKE) and  Swedbank  (ST:SWEDa).
The FSA found improvements had been made since an earlier review in 2016 by DNB, the Nordic region's biggest bank by market value, but said the lender still had significant shortcomings and had taken too long to start to rectify earlier problems.

Problems within compliance were also found at DNB's private banking unit, the FSA said, and a new inspection will be conducted shortly."

(Reuters) -  Bayer AG  (DE:BAYGN) is in mediation to potentially settle thousands of U.S. lawsuits claiming that the company's Roundup weed killer causes cancer, but some legal experts said the cases raises novel questions that may prevent an easy settlement.
More than 18,400 plaintiffs claim Roundup causes a type of cancer called non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
Bayer to date has lost three U.S. jury trials in the Roundup litigation. The company is appealing the decisions, saying Roundup and its active ingredient glyphosate are not carcinogenic and safe for human use.
On July 30, Bayer said it is ""constructively engaging"" in talks led by mediator Ken Feinberg. Bayer's chief executive said he would only consider a ""financially reasonable"" settlement if the company can end all litigation.
Feinberg said mediation was still in the early stages and compensation had not been discussed.
Bayer declined to comment, citing confidentiality agreements in the mediation. Plaintiffs lawyers did not respond to requests for comment.
Legal experts outlined several obstacles the parties may face on the path towards settlement.
WHY IS THE ROUNDUP LITIGATION DIFFERENT FROM OTHER PRODUCT CASES?
Settlements involving drugs, medical devices or consumer goods often result in the addition of a warning label, a recall or the outright discontinuance of a product. Those steps generally close the door to future lawsuits, making settlement costs and risks predictable.
Bayer has never publicly considered pulling Roundup off the market. The company in June announced a $5.6 million investment to research and develop a glyphosate alternative.
Bayer unit  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON) began selling Roundup in 1974 and while the formulation is no longer patent-protected, Roundup remains widely available today. Bayer has repeatedly said Roundup is safe and important to farmers who use the herbicide in combination with the company's genetically modified seeds
Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma on average can take up to 10 years to emerge, increasing the likelihood of claims being filed after the litigation has settled. Product liability settlements generally include a cut-off date for future claimants and need to be properly funded for a court to approve the agreement.
As long as the product continues to be sold without changes to the label, plaintiffs may continue to file lawsuits, said Elizabeth Burch, a law professor at the University of Georgia.
COULD BAYER ADD A CANCER WARNING?
Plaintiffs lawyers, who claim the company manipulated the science, told Reuters they would insist on a cancer warning label as part of any Roundup settlement.
Such a warning has been rejected by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, which regulates pesticides and repeatedly has found glyphosate to be safe.
The agency in an Aug. 7 letter said any glyphosate cancer warning constitutes ""a false and misleading statement,"" and ordered California, the only U.S. state requiring such a warning, to remove the label.
David Noll, a professor at Rutgers Law School, said adding a cancer warning over a regulator's explicit opposition presented unchartered legal territory.
HOW COULD BAYER SETTLE THE ROUNDUP LITIGATION?
To settle product liability litigation, companies generally set up a fund and the parties define criteria that current and future claimants must fulfill to receive compensation.
In the Roundup litigation, claimants could be divided into different groups depending on the frequency of their Roundup use and disease severity and length.
But Adam Zimmerman, a law professor at Loyola Law School, said defining those groups is complicated by the lack of a signature disease associated with Roundup, making it difficult to predict Bayer's liability.
For example, in asbestos litigation, mesothelioma, a rare tissue cancer, was recognized as a signature disease caused by exposure to asbestos fibers.
Doctors recognize several risk factors leading to non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, but the disease is largely considered to have no known cause. Around 74,000 people in the United States are expected to be diagnosed with the disease in 2019, according to the American Cancer Society.
Settling claims might not preclude future lawsuits if the fund runs out of money. In the Agent Orange litigation, Vietnam War veterans were allowed to sue chemical companies decades after a settlement was reached because the compensation fund was depleted by the time they developed their diseases."

Investing.com -- Europe’s stock markets were broadly mixed after early trading on Thursday, with stronger-than-expected business surveys in the eurozone’s two biggest economies failing to generate any noticeable feelgood factor.
‘Flash’ readings of IHS Markit’s purchasing managers’ indexes for France and Germany all beat expectations, both in manufacturing and services, and suggested that the euro zone will avoid a recession despite signs that Germany, its largest single economy, is headed for one.
By 5 AM ET, the benchmark STOXX 600 was down 0.3%, while the German DAX was down 0.2%. The U.K. FTSE 100, buffeted all week by political noise about an increasingly likely ‘No-Deal Brexit’ was down 0.6%.
Italy’s FTSE MIB led the way for a second straight day, rising 0.5% on hopes that snap elections can be avoided. The country’s president is due to sound out the center-left Democratic Party later Thursday about its willingness to govern together with 5 Stars, something that has seemed highly unlikely until this week.
“The rebound in the Euro-area PMIs was mildly positive news, but the details remain worrying,” said Nordea Markets’ strategist Jan von Gerich “The euro-area economy is too weak to generate meaningful inflation pressures, which means the ECB needs to do more,” he said. He added that the forward-looking components of the services PMI had also fallen, suggesting that the one sector that has propped up the economy so far this year is now also faltering.
Markets were generally in holding mode, awaiting the start of the U.S. Federal Reserve’s conference in Jackson Hole, where Chairman Jerome Powell will take center stage on Friday. 
Among the notable gainers were NMC Health (LON:NMC), a London-listed healthcare group focused on the Middle East, which rose as much as 42% after an unconfirmed Reuters report that two competing interests want to buy up to 40% of the company from its largest shareholders at a substantial premium. The shares retraced later but were still up 26% on the day, after the company reported quarterly figures in line with consensus.
Elsewhere in the health space, medical device maker Ambu (CSE:AMBUb) slumped nearly 20% after warning again on profits.

DUBLIN (Reuters) - All Ryanair (I:RYA) flights to and from British and Irish airports have departed without disruption so far on Thursday, the airline said, adding it also expected no impact for the rest of the day from a strike by some of its pilots based in Britain.
Ryanair unions in Ireland, Britain, Spain and Portugal have been planning strikes over various grievances that began with a five-day cabin crew walkout in Portugal on Wednesday and continued with a 48-hour strike by some UK pilots on Thursday.
Europe's biggest low cost airlines said its first flights to and from UK airports on Thursday operated with 97% punctuality, with the slight slip due to air traffic control delays. 
While more widespread strikes over pay and conditions a year ago forced Ryanair to cancel hundreds of flights, the airline has forecast minimal disruption this time and ran a full schedule without major delays in the first day of action in Portugal.
With the exception of two delayed flights, all departures from Portugal appeared to be operating as normal on Thursday.
Fernando Gandra, head of the SNPVAC trade union representing striking Portuguese cabin crew, told Reuters the airline had managed the fallout by making major changes to departure times in advance and notifying passengers ahead of time.
Ryanair also limited the potential disruption by taking its fight to the courts on Wednesday and winning an Irish High Court injunction to prevent Dublin-based pilots striking.
A London court rejected a similar application against its British pilots, who plan a second strike from the early hours of Sept. 2 until just before midnight on Sept. 4.
Ryanair has said the striking pilots, members of the British Airline Pilots Association (BALPA), represent less than 30% of those operating its aircraft there.
Unions representing cabin crew in Spain said this week their plans for 10 days of strikes next month still stood after a round of mediated talks with the airline ended without agreement.
The strikes are the first since Ryanair managed to quell last year's disputes by reaching pay deals with many staff in Europe following its dramatic U-turn in late 2017 to recognize trade unions for the first time.

However, it has failed to move beyond recognition deals with others and further angered unions by telling staff last month that it had 900 more pilots and crew than it needed due to delays in the delivery of the grounded Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX, and would have to close some bases.

1486,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 22, 2019 04:45AM ET</span>","European shares steady on upbeat PMI data, Italy jumps","By Amy Caren Daniel and Shreyashi Sanyal
(Reuters) - European shares traded close to flat on Thursday as upbeat surveys on Germany and the euro zone offset signs that U.S. policymakers had not intended to start a cycle of interest rate cuts with last month's move.
Germany's DAX (GDAXI) shrugged off a weak open, to trade 0.1% higher, after Markit's flash composite Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), which tracks the manufacturing and services sectors, rose to 51.4 in August, above expectations of 50.5.
The leading indicator also showed French business activity expanded in August, pointing to resilience in the euro zone's two biggest economies after Germany contracted in the second quarter.
A similar survey showed Euro zone business growth picked up a touch in August, helped by brisk services activity and as manufacturing contracted at a slower pace.
The data helped the pan-European STOXX 600 index (STOXX) to recover from solid initial losses to trade just 0.1% lower by 0815 GMT, with Italian stocks (FTMIB) outperforming with a 0.39% rise.
""What we are seeing is the service sector holding up comfortably well while the industrial slump has got more room to run and even possibly deepen,"" said Holger Schmieding Chief Economist at Berenberg.
""This data is not going make recessionary concerns worse, but it also won't make them vanish anytime soon. We are still far away from any stabilization and it could possibly drag on till we see at least a partial trade deal between the U.S. and China.""
Flash surveys from the United States are due later in the day.
Italy reversed earlier losses after Reuters reported President Sergio Mattarella wanted clear signs of a possible deal to form a new government by the end of the day.
""That is actually good news because the immediate challenge for Italy is to come up with a 2020 budget by mid-October, now the 5-Star and Democratic Party (PD) could possibly broker a compromise with the EU which would reduce uncertainty,"" Schmieding said.
Hopes of stimulus moves by governments and central banks have steadied major stock markets in the past week but most are still on course to end August lower after a two-week sell-off driven by concerns that major economies were heading for recession.
The Federal Reserve minutes on Wednesday showed policymakers were deeply divided over whether to cut rates in July, but united in wanting to signal they were not on a preset path to more cuts that would support economic growth.
Minutes from the European Central Bank's last policy meeting are also due at 11:30 GMT.
Ahead is the Fed's annual Jackson Hole meeting of central bankers, which should provide more clues to the Fed's mood after U.S. President Donald Trump's announcement of additional tariffs on Chinese goods at the start of August.
The biggest gainer on the STOXX was NMC Health Plc (L:NMC), up 26%, after Reuters reported that two groups, including one backed by China's Fosun (HK:0656), have made competing offers to buy a 40% stake.
Shares of Ambu A/S (CO:AMBUb) plunged 15.2%, to the bottom of the STOXX 600, after the company issued its second profit warning in three months."
1487,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 22, 2019 04:44AM ET</span>",Indonesia Threatens to Halt Airbus Jet Orders Over Palm Oil Feud,"(Bloomberg) -- Indonesia is pushing its domestic airlines to halt purchase of Airbus SE planes in retaliation for curbs imposed by the European Union on use of palm biodiesel.
Indonesia’s Trade Minister Enggartiasto Lukita is also asking carriers including PT Lion Mentari Airlines to consider switching their outstanding aircraft to Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co. Lukita has spoken to Lion’s co-founder Rusdi Kirana about dumping Airbus and the country’s largest low-cost carrier supports the government move, the minister said in a text message on Thursday.
“We are exploring all options,” Lukita said, when asked if the government would order all carriers to switch to Boeing from Airbus. “I have contacted Rusdi, and he said the airline will follow whatever the government decides.”
Siva Govindasamy, a Singapore-based spokesman for Airbus, didn’t immediately respond to request for comments.
The Indonesian threat to turn its back on Airbus is the fallout of European Union’s decision earlier this year to place stricter limits on palm oil’s use in biofuels on concerns over deforestation. Indonesia, the world’s largest producer of the tropical vegetable oil, last week also threatened to slap retaliatory tariffs on import of dairy products from EU after the bloc imposed anti-subsidy duties on its palm oil biodiesel.
The escalation of trade feud may complicate Lion’s plan to turn to the European manufacturer following a dispute with Boeing after the crash of its 737 Max 8 jet last year, which killed 189 people. Flag carrier PT Garuda Indonesia has also said that it may cancel its Boeing Max orders for other models.
Lion Air Said to Plan Airbus Order Switch After Boeing 737 Crash
Lion Air placed an order for eight Airbus A330neo planes worth $2.4 billion at list prices last year, adding to a 2013 order for 234 planes worth $24 billion.

German telecoms group  Freenet  (DE:FNTGn), Sunrise's largest shareholder, has called the 6.3 billion Swiss franc ($6.41 billion) takeover unfavorable for existing shareholders.
In a broadside calling Freenet ""self-serving,"" Sunrise touted updated expectations of 280 million francs in annual synergies from buying Liberty Global's UPC Swiss unit, 45 million more than previously announced.
Freenet was not immediately available to comment.
The Swiss company said these benefits, along with improved performance of UPC, would allow it to increase leverage and reduce the size of the 4.1 billion franc rights issue it foresees to pay for the deal by about 1 billion francs.
Sunrise said one-off integration costs needed to achieve the higher synergies are expected to increase from 140-150 million to 230-250 million francs. It added Freenet had rejected its proposed changes.
""Sunrise views Freenet as guided by its own short-term financial constraints and self-serving objectives which it seeks to solve at the expense of Sunrise and its shareholders,"" Sunrise said, adding its board has decided to exclude Freenet from deliberations on the deal.
Sunrise second-quarter net income rose to 27 million francs, from 24 million francs in the year-earlier period, the Swiss company said. Revenue fell 1.7% to 455 million francs, which Sunrise said resulted from lower mobile hardware and hubbing sales."

Yokohama, facing Tokyo Bay and located a short train ride from the capital, joins other candidates such as Osaka, Nagasaki and Wakayama vying to host integrated resorts (IR) expected to attract more tourists and investment.
""We must look to Yokohama's future, the 20-30 years ahead,"" Mayor Fumiko Hayashi told a news conference streamed on the city government's website, announcing its preparation of an official bid. ""I've come to the conclusion that in order to achieve growth and development, we need IR.""
Japan is widely seen as a prize market for casino operators due to its affluent population of 128 million and proximity to Asia's wealthy gamblers. The government is expected to allow casino resorts in three sites initially.
Japanese lawmakers finished legalizing casinos last year after a series of controversial bills and years of debate, with opponents citing risks of increased gambling addiction and organized crime activity.
Prolonged discussions meant no resorts will be open in time for the Tokyo 2020 Olympics, with the government yet to pick hosts and operators.
But new casino resorts are expected to help Japan maintain growth in tourism and investment after the Summer Games are over. Some analysts have said the casino market could be worth around $20 billion a year, or even more when opened in three cities.

1493,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 22, 2019 12:36AM ET</span>",Hong Kong Faces Worst Earnings Recession Since 2008 Crisis,"(Bloomberg) -- Hong Kong stocks are poised for their worst quarter since 2015 and corporate earnings are unlikely to save them.
After a sell-off erased more than $600 billion from the city’s equities, attractive valuations stood as a potential bright spot. But those multiples don’t look so good when analysts keep slashing their profit forecasts for 2019. Their call for an average 19% slump in operating income would be the biggest contraction for Hang Seng Index companies since the global financial crisis, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
While a protracted U.S.-China trade war and a weak yuan are to blame for a big chunk of the profit reductions, the latest cuts reveal a deeper issue. With Hong Kong’s slowing economy buckling under the pressure of 11 straight weeks of protests, demand for everything from bank loans to utility gas may be jeopardized.
“The third quarter could be even worse given the local political situation and the trade war escalation,” said Jackson Wong, asset management director at Amber Hill Capital Ltd. “Potential downside surprises have not been fully reflected in share prices.""
Shares of utilities provider Hong Kong and China Gas Co. fell 5.3% Wednesday after it posted disappointing results and said the local business environment is “full of challenges.” Political unrest in Hong Kong may dampen its sales to the hospitality industry as people opt to cook at home rather than dine out, analysts at Daiwa Securities Group Inc. say.
Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd. said late Wednesday the protests will have a “significant impact” on revenue from August. The airline, which saw its employees’ participation in the Hong Kong protests draw the ire of Beijing, said business and leisure traffic into the city has weakened “significantly.”
The threat from the trade war and weeks of local unrest has been apparent in the property market, as well as hotel occupancy and retail sales. CK Asset Holdings Ltd., whose shares fell to lowest since January 2017 last week, postponed a luxury residential project because of the protests. It spent about $3.3 billion buying British pub owner Greene King Plc.
 HSBC Holdings  Plc (LON:HSBA) and BOC Hong Kong Holdings Ltd. have lost about 9% this month as investors become increasingly concerned about capital flight.
A weak yuan is also bad news for the Hang Seng Index: its firms get an average 64% of revenue from the mainland, and 22% from Hong Kong,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) calculates. The currency broke past the key 7 per dollar this month for the first time since 2008, and has traded weaker than that level for more than two weeks.
The gloomy profit outlook comes at a critical time for Hong Kong’s equity market. While cheap valuations spurred some dip-buying this week, strategists at Morgan Stanley and  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Group AG are among those turning more bearish. The Hang Seng Index is still down 13% since its April high, one of the worst returns in the world.
“I don’t know when earnings will turn around,” said Amber Hill’s Wong. “For that to happen, we at least need a stable political environment in Hong Kong and an agreement to end the trade war.""

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - German auto maker  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn) plans to build Mercedes Benz-branded heavy trucks in China by revamping truck plants owned by its local joint venture, according to a document seen by Reuters and two sources familiar with the matter.
The plan will deepen the alliance between Daimler and its Chinese truck JV partner, Beiqi Foton Co Ltd (SS:600166), and comes after the purchase of a 5% stake in Daimler last month by its Mercedes Benz passenger car partner, Beijing Automotive Group Co Ltd (BAIC), Foton's parent group.
""Localization of Mercedes Benz-branded trucks had been planned years before, so it has nothing to do with BAIC Group's recent stake purchase in Daimler,"" one source said.
In 2016, Daimler's then head of its truck business told German media that it planned to make Mercedes Benz-branded Actros heavy trucks in China by the end of the decade. No details of the plan has since been reported or announced.
Under the plan, Beijing Foton Daimler Automotive (BFDA) will add Actros to its production lines which are mainly used to make Auman trucks, the joint venture's sole truck brand, the sources said.
The JV plans to revamp its No.3 plant, which will have an annual capacity of 60,000 heavy trucks, and expand capacity at its No.2 plant to 100,000 units from 60,000 now, according to a document on the JV's website. The value of the investment was not known.
The No.3 plant will build both Actros and Auman trucks, said the sources, who declined to be identified because the plan had not been made public.
Daimler's office in China did not immediately respond to phone calls seeking comment. Foton declined to comment.
All Mercedes Benz trucks currently sold in China are imported and priced significantly higher than domestically made Auman trucks.
Founded in 2012, the truck joint venture sold just over 100,000 units in China last year. Daimler is seeking to further develop its truck business with Foton, but the lack of a solid supply chain in China remains an obstacle, the sources said.
""One of the biggest challenges is to build up a good local supply chain, as many heavy truck components for Mercedes Benz trucks cannot be locally sourced for now,"" the second source said.
China's heavy truck market has fared better than the overall auto market this year, thanks to a growing e-commerce industry and improvements in traffic and logistics infrastructure.
China sold 732,000 heavy trucks in the first seven months this year, down 1.4% from the same period a year earlier, while the overall auto market dropped 13.5%.
Other major heavy truck makers in China include FAW, Dongfeng (HK:0489) and  Sinotruk  (HK:3808)."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Four dominant e-cigarette manufacturers face a probe into the health impacts of their products, as the U.S. House Energy and Commerce Committee asked on Wednesday about the firms' research and marketing practices.
The committee sent letters to Juul Labs Inc, 35% owned by Marlboro maker  Altria Group  (NYSE:MO) Inc, Fontem Ventures, Japan Tobacco Inc, and Reynolds American Inc (NYSE:RAI), a unit of  British American Tobacco  (LON:BATS) Plc.
The letter to Juul asked if the company has conducted or financed studies on the health implications of using its products and the effectiveness of Juul in helping users quit smoking. It asked if Juul has sent information to the Food and Drug Administration. 
Kaelan Hollon, a spokeswoman for Reynolds American, said the company is reviewing the letter and believes ""minors should never use tobacco products, including vapor products."" 
Japan Tobacco said in a statement it welcomes any opportunity to ""set out the responsible approaches"" it takes in its marketing. 
Juul and Fontem Ventures did not respond to requests for comment. 
The probe comes amid growing scrutiny of the e-cigarette industry by lawmakers. A separate House panel in July released internal Juul emails that committee staff described as attempts to ""enter schools and convey its messaging directly to teenage children."" 
James Monsees, Juul's co-founder and chief product officer, told the panel the company's target audience is adult cigarette smokers.
Representative Frank Pallone, the Democratic chair of the committee, cited vaping-related lung illnesses recently reported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. He requested answers and documents by Sept. 20. 

The CDC said on Wednesday it is investigating 153 possible cases of severe lung illness associated with e-cigarette use in 16 states. No deaths have been reported, they said.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Mori Building Co is spending more than $5 billion on a massive real estate project in Tokyo, creating a city within a city with everything from offices, a British school and vegetable gardens to the tallest building in Japan.
The Japanese developer [MRBLD.UL] known for its ""Hills"" brand of properties said on Thursday it had started construction this month on the Toranomon-Azabudai redevelopment project, near the Roppongi district, with costs estimated around 580 billion yen ($5.5 billion). Completion is slated for March 2023.
The project, yet to be officially named, will include three high-rise towers for about 20,000 office workers and 3,500 residents. The 64-floor main tower will reach 330 meters (1,080 feet).
That will surpass the 300 meter Abeno Harukas in Osaka, which opened in 2014, to become the country's tallest building - at least until around 2027 when Mitsubishi Estate (T:8802) completes a 390 meter high-rise at its Tokiwabashi project near Tokyo station.
Earthquake-prone Japan has lagged other countries in building height but its skylines are creeping higher as advanced seismic designs minimize swaying caused by quakes as well as wind. The 634 meter Tokyo Sky Tree, the world's tallest broadcast tower, opened in 2012.
This upward climb is line with the strategy of Mori Building, whose late co-founder Minoru Mori had long advocated his vision of compact, ""vertical garden cities"" aimed at improving quality of life in the sprawling metropolis.
Mori Building said the 8.1 hectare (20 acres) complex would be centered around a 6,000 square meter park. Total floor area will be 860,400 square meters, surpassing Mori's Roppongi Hills to make it the developer's biggest-ever project by floor space.
The complex will host the British School in Tokyo with approximately 700 students, to attract global companies and overseas workers, Mori said.
It will also hold a yet-to-be announced luxury hotel brand debuting in Japan, as well as a large-scale food market, museums and galleries and a medical facility to promote wellness.
The project highlights developers' bullishness on Tokyo beyond the 2020 Olympics. Average land prices in the metropolitan area are at their highest since the 2008 financial crisis, data from the Japan Real Estate Institute show, as the economy has recovered and construction and infrastructure projects gather pace ahead of Tokyo 2020."
1498,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 21, 2019 09:45PM ET</span>",Australia to crack down on high-stakes derivatives trading,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's market watchdog on Wednesday said it plans to ban the sale of ""binary"" options to retail customers and introduce restrictions on sales of other derivative instruments seen as high-risk transactions. 
The proposed curbs on the A$2 billion ($1.36 billion) a-year industry follows other regulatory bans in Europe and North America and follows new intervention powers granted to the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) in April.
The global crackdown on high-stakes financial betting by amateur traders has already hurt earnings of trading platforms IG Group (L:IGG) Plus500 (L:PLUSP), CMC Markets (L:CMCX), and Interactive Brokers Group Inc (EI:IBKR), all of which have a big presence in Australia.
""ASIC is concerned that retail investors have suffered, and are likely in future to suffer, significant detriment from binary options and contracts for difference (CFDs),"" it said in a statement. CFDs allow traders to bet on financial asset prices without holding the asset.
The regulator issued a consultation paper outlining plans to ban all sales of binary options to retail customers, which it likened to gambling products.
Binary options are over the counter (OTC) derivatives that allow clients to make ""all-or-nothing"" bets on specific events in a specific timeframe, such as a rise in the gold price within a 30 second window.
According to ASIC, issuers of such products generated gross trading revenue of A$2 billion in 2018, of which 25% were from binary options and the balance from CFDs. 
""We estimate that retail client losses from trading binary options were at least $490 million in 2018,"" the paper said.
The proposal is open to submissions from market participants until Oct. 1 and ASIC expects to reach a final decision shortly after the consultation period ends, a spokesman said.
""A complete ban would prevent retail clients from losing money trading binary options,"" ASIC Commissioner Cathie Armour said in a statement.
Under its proposal, retail sales of CFDs would have leverage limits and rules to improve pricing transparency.
In recent years, regulators in Europe and North America have moved to ban or limit the issue and distribution of binary options to retail clients, and some have introduced leverage limits on CFDs.
According to ASIC's review, Australian issuers of binary options and CFDs have about one million clients. Of these, 17% were domestic, a fifth were in China, where such trades are prohibited, and about 41% were in the rest of Asia.

1500,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 21, 2019 07:10PM ET</span>",Nordstrom beats profit estimates as it clears inventory faster and sells more online,"By Nivedita Balu and Melissa Fares
(Reuters) - Upscale U.S. retailer  Nordstrom Inc  (N:JWN) reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit on Wednesday as it said it had cut costs and cleared more inventory, sending its shares up 10% in extended trading.
The Seattle-based company, which sells everything from apparel and footwear to home decor, said digital sales rose 4% for the second quarter ended Aug. 3, although weaker sales at both its full-price department stores and off-price Nordstrom Rack stores dragged total revenue down 5% to $3.87 billion. 
Nordstrom, like other brick-and-mortar retailers, is seeking ways to respond to changing consumer habits, with more shoppers preferring fast fashion brands and online giants like Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) rather than malls. 
It has invested heavily in both its e-commerce business as well as its loyalty programs, and said it was on track to open its first store selling only women's merchandise in New York City this October.
Other ways it is trying to engage millennials and other shoppers include concept stores such as 'Nordstrom Local,' which holds no stock but serves as a pickup center for online orders while also offering personal styling and tailoring services.
It has also worked on inventory management and is offering more on-trend product assortments as part of a turnaround plan to boost profit. 
""We exited the quarter in a favorable inventory position and made important strides in productivity,"" Nordstrom co-President Erik Nordstrom said.
Inventory was down 6.5% over last year, the company said.
Last week, rival Macy's Inc (N:M) cut its full-year earnings forecast after missing estimates for quarterly profit for the first time in at least two years, as it discounted merchandise heavily to clear spring inventory.
Nordstrom net earnings fell to $141 million, or 90 cents per share, in the quarter from $162 million, or 95 cents per share, a year earlier. 
Analysts were expecting Nordstrom to report revenue of $3.93 billion and a profit of 75 cents for the quarter, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Shares of Nordstrom have tumbled roughly 58% in the past year, versus an 11.5% drop for the S&P Composite 1500 Apparel Retail index <.SPCOMRETA> over the same period.
On Wednesday, its shares were up about 10% at $29.10 in extended trading, after rising about 5.5% in regular trade.
Nordstrom forecast net sales for the year falling by about 2%, at the lower end of its previous estimate.
The company also cut the upper range of its annual adjusted profit forecast and now expects to earn between $3.25 per share to $3.50 per share from a range of $3.25 per share to $3.65 per share, excluding any share repurchases.

""While second quarter profits exceeded expectations, sales came in on the low end and Nordstrom's downward revision of guidance again following a sharp guidance cut in the first quarter suggests that the retailer's challenges run deep,"" said CFRA Research analyst Camilla Yanushevsky, adding ""we expect shares to cool in trading tomorrow morning.""

The S&P 500 gained 0.8%, with the Dow Jones Industrials up 0.9%. The Nasdaq Composite gained 0.9%.
The market opened smartly higher with the Dow up as many as 306 points, then lost a little momentum after minutes from the Federal Reserve's July meeting suggested its rate cut was a recalibration of current policy and not a signal of a major round of rate cutting.
With today's rally, the S&P 500 and Dow are each up 2.8% after their pounding on August 14. The Dow fell 800 points that day. The Nasdaq is up 3%. 
Boeing (NYSE:BA) posted a 2.5% gain that added 56 points to the Dow's rise by itself. Twenty-nine of the 30 Dow stocks moved higher, with Walmart (NYSE:WMT) finishing with a small 0.04% loss.

Target jumped 20.4%, its biggest one-day gain ever, after saying investments in stores and in online sales were producing strong results. The company raised its full-year guidance. Lowe's, up 10%, also easily beat estimates, despite falling lumber prices.

Gold futures were flat at $1,515,70 an ounce. Interest rates moved higher as investor demand for stocks pulled money away from bonds.
The 10-year Treasury yield rose to 1.581% from Tuesday's 1.559%. But the yield curve between the 10-year and 2-year did invert briefly again following the Fed minutes.The spread was 1.68 basis points at the close, down from 4.3 basis points on Tuesday.

1. Salesforce Earnings on Tap
Tech earnings are on the slate for Thursday, with Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) and VMware (NYSE:VMW) set to report results after the closing bell. 
Salesforce is expected to report earnings of 47 cents per share on revenue of $3.95 billion. 
Guidance will likely generate extra attention, with investors keen to see if the company tweaks its recently revised outlook following its acquisition of Seattle-based Tableau Software in a $15.7 billion deal.
Safesforce shares are up 7.6% for the year but off 8.6% since announcing the Tableau deal on June 10.
The deal, which closed on Aug. 1, forced the company to cut its expectations for growth.
Salesforce previously guided full-year earnings in the range of $2.68 to $2.70 a share, flagging a 20 cents to 22 cents a share hit to earnings as a result of the Tablueau deal.
Ahead of the report, Wedbush said the company’s efforts to boost growth in international markets and verticals could underpin performance and added that Salesforce was an ""attractive and reasonably defensive growth investment."" 
VMware (NYSE:VMW), meanwhile, is expected to report earnings of $1.55 a share on revenue of $2.43 billion.
2. ECB Minutes; Eurozone PMIs in Focus
EUR/USD could be the one to watch in currency markets as the European Central Bank is set to release the minutes of its previous policy meeting on Thursday at 4 AM ET (8:00 GMT).
The minutes could provide fresh clues on the size of the central bank’s new round of stimulus expected in September.
Eurozone manufacturing and services PMIs, meanwhile, will also draw some attention as both measures are expected to have fallen slightly in August from last month.
3. U.S. Jobless Claims, Manufacturing, Services Data Due
At 8:30 AM ET, the Labor Department releases its weekly count of the number of individuals who filed for unemployment insurance for the week ended Aug. 18.
Economists forecast that initial jobless claims fell to 216,000 from 220,000. 
At 9:45 AM ET, Markit will releases its preliminary purchasing managers' index (PMI) readings for May.
The manufacturing PMI is seen a notch higher at 50.5 and the services PMI is expected to drop to 52.9."

Nvidia is ""uniquely positioned"" to grow at a faster compound annual rate than its peers and is in the ""early innings"" of its growth story due to the ""increasing use of GPUs across a diverse set of growth markets,” Roy said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street's main indexes rose on Wednesday as upbeat earnings from retailers pointed to strength in U.S. consumer demand, and stocks held gains after minutes from the Federal Reserve's meeting last month showed that policymakers had debated a more aggressive rate cut.
U.S. stocks opened solidly higher following better-than-expected results from retailers  Target  Corp (N:TGT) and Lowe's Cos Inc (N:LOW). Target shares surged 19.4% after the big-box retailer raised its annual earnings forecast. Lowe's shares climbed 10.3% after the home-improvement chain beat profit estimates.
Minutes from the Fed's policy-setting meeting on July 30-31, when the Fed cut rates by 25 basis points, showed that policymakers debated cutting interest rates more aggressively. Some participants preferred a 50-basis-point cut, but the committee was united in wanting to avoid the appearance of being on a path to further rate cuts.
Stocks briefly pared gains following the release of the minutes at 2 p.m. ET (1800 GMT), but then returned to their levels prior to the release.
""The stocks still want to see any evidence that the Fed is going to cut rates,"" said Willie Delwiche, investment strategist at Baird in Milwaukee.
""I don't think there's anything in here that would be an 'aha!' warning sign to stocks that they're not going to get another rate cut."" he said. ""But I also think that the longer-term picture of where the market sees rates ending up and where the Fed sees rates ending up might be different right now, and that's going to have to get resolved at some point.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. money market funds amassed their highest level of assets since October 2009 as investors shift cash into low-risk products amid worries about a global economic slowdown and trade tensions, a private report released on Wednesday showed.
Taxable money funds, which are seen as almost as safe as bank accounts, are offering higher yields than most U.S. Treasuries.
Benchmark 10-year Treasury yields were 1.588% on Wednesday after hitting 1.475% last week, which was a three-year low.
Total money fund assets increased by $17.11 billion to $3.328 trillion in the week ended Aug. 20, putting them at their highest level since October 2009, the Money Fund Report said.
Money fund assets have grown by $357 billion, or 12%, since the end of 2018.
Taxable money market fund assets increased by $17.37 billion to $3.192 trillion, but tax-free assets fell by $261.90 million to $135.69 billion, according to the report, published by iMoneyNet.
The iMoneyNet average seven-day simple yield for taxable money funds fell to 1.79%, the lowest level since October, from 1.80% a week earlier. The weighted average maturity among taxable funds lengthened by one day to 30 days.
The iMoneyNet average seven-day yield for tax-free and municipal funds rose to 0.96% from 0.94% the week before. The weighted average maturity of tax-free funds was unchanged at 29 days.
U.S. money market rates have stabilized in the aftermath of the Federal Reserve's first rate decrease since 2008 at the end of July.
Traders widely expect the U.S. central bank to lower key overnight rates by another quarter point at its policy meeting next month to counter risks from a softening global economy and disruptions from the trade conflict between China and the United States.

1513,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 21, 2019 02:55PM ET</span>","Citigroup, BNP caught up in U.S. case against Huawei CFO: documents","By Karen Freifeld
NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S.-based  Citigroup  Inc (N:C) and French bank  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) are caught up in the U.S. criminal case against the chief financial officer of China's Huawei Technologies, according to newly available documents.
The banks were named in documents released on Tuesday after a hearing in British Columbia Supreme Court, where Huawei CFO Meng Wanzhou is fighting extradition to the United States on bank fraud charges.
The two are among at least four financial institutions that had banking relationships with Huawei when Meng and others allegedly misled them about its business dealings in Iran despite U.S. sanctions. 
Two others,  HSBC Holdings  Plc (L:HSBA) and  Standard Chartered  (L:STAN), have been previously reported. 
The banks are considered “victim” institutions in the 13-count indictment the United States brought against Meng and Huawei, which includes charges of bank and wire fraud, violating sanctions against Iran and obstructing justice. 
Both she and Huawei have denied wrongdoing. 
Spokespeople for Citigroup, BNP Paribas, Standard Chartered, and HSBC all declined to comment, as did a spokesman for U.S. prosecutors. Huawei did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the newly public information.
The British Columbia court made public hundreds of pages of documents and other materials, including video of Meng's detention, in advance of a hearing scheduled to begin Sept. 23 in Vancouver. 
Meng, the daughter of Huawei's billionaire founder Ren Zhengfei, was arrested at Vancouver’s airport in December on a U.S. warrant and her lawyers argue she was unlawfully detained. They claim Canadian authorities delayed her arrest to allow the border patrol to gather evidence for the United States as part of a ""covert criminal investigation.""
In the video, Meng can be seen moving through the Vancouver airport customs and immigration area, escorted by border agents, and being questioned. 
In a transcript, Meng repeatedly asks why she was being detained and is eventually told she can contact a lawyer, but not her family.
""My family members will be worried if they can't find me,"" she says.
Meng was searched and interrogated for hours in violation of her constitutional rights, her lawyers say. She spent more than a week in detention before being granted bail.
TRADE WAR
Diplomatic relations between Canada and China turned icy after Meng was detained and China subsequently arrested two Canadian citizens, charging them with espionage. It has also blocked imports of some Canadian commodities.
Meng and Huawei also have become part of the escalating U.S. and China trade war.
U.S. President Donald Trump told Reuters in December he would intervene in her case if it would help secure a deal with China, leading her lawyers to argue the extradition proceedings are being used for economic and political purposes.
In Tuesday's court documents, they describe Trump's comments about Meng as ""corrosive of the rule of law."" 
The United States also has made a broader push against Huawei, the world's largest telecommunications maker, which it maintains is involved in activities contrary to U.S. national security or foreign policy interests.
Huawei was placed on a U.S. trade blacklist in May that bans the sale of U.S. parts and components to the company without special licenses. So far, the licenses have not been granted except to allow the repair and maintenance of existing products and networks. 
Besides alleged sanctions-busting, the United States says the company's smartphones and network equipment could be used by China to spy on Americans, allegations the company also has repeatedly denied.
In one document released on Tuesday, the United States describes the evidence against Meng, including articles published by Reuters in 2012 and 2013 about a company in Iran called Skycom Tech that had tried to sell computer equipment from a U.S. firm to a customer in Iran.
The reporting detailed links between Huawei and Skycom, including that Meng had served on Skycom’s board of directors between February 2008 and April 2009.
The articles were ""concerning"" to at least four financial institutions that banked for Huawei, according to the document, which was drafted by a U.S. federal prosecutor in Brooklyn, New York, where the case was brought against Meng and Huawei.
U.S. laws and regulations generally prohibited the banks from providing U.S. dollar transactions tied to Iran through the United States.   
Meng and others defrauded HSBC and other banks by misrepresenting Huawei's relationship with Skycom, according to U.S. prosecutors who claim Skycom’s operations in Iran were controlled by Huawei from at least 2007 until 2014.
U.S. authorities claim Huawei used Skycom to obtain embargoed U.S. goods, technology and services in Iran, and to move money via the international banking system.
According to the newly available document about the evidence, witnesses for the prosecution of the U.S. case will include executives from HSBC, Standard Chartered and Citigroup, and an FBI forensic accountant is expected to testify about documents showing BNP Paribas provided banking services for Huawei between at least 2013 and 2018.
In February, when Reuters exclusively reported that HSBC conducted a probe that helped bring the case against Meng and Huawei, a spokesman said the bank was legally obligated to provide the information it did to the U.S. Department of Justice. 

All four banks have resolved their own sanctions issues with U.S. authorities in recent years. The agreements range from BNP Paribas paying $8.9 billion in 2014 and pleading guilty in U.S. court to Citigroup agreeing to pay $217,841 the same year over potential civil liability for its apparent violations of sanctions programs.

1514,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 21, 2019 02:24PM ET</span>",Dozens of Airbus A380s face urgent checks after cracked part dug from ice,"By Tim Hepher
LONDON (Reuters) - Investigators probing an engine explosion on an Air France A380 in 2017 are studying a possible manufacturing flaw in a recently salvaged cracked part in a move likely to trigger urgent checks on dozens of Airbus superjumbos, people familiar with the matter said.
The focus of a two-year-old investigation into the mid-air explosion over Greenland, which left the plane carrying more than 500 passengers with the front of one engine missing, has switched to the recently recovered ""fan hub,"" the people said.
The titanium alloy part is the centerpiece of a 3-metre-wide fan on engines built for the world's largest airliner by U.S.-based Engine Alliance, co-owned by  General Electric  (N:GE) and United Technologies unit Pratt & Whitney (N:UTX).
It had sat buried in Greenland's ice sheet since September 2017 when one of four engines on Air France flight 66 abruptly disintegrated en route from Paris to Los Angeles. It was prised from the ice in June after a high-tech aerial radar search.
Confirming the focus of the probe after Reuters reported the plans for inspections, France's BEA air accident agency said it had discovered a ""sub-surface fatigue crack"" on the recovered part and the engine maker was preparing checks.
The people familiar with the matter linked the crack to a suspected manufacturing flaw and said the checks - to be carried out urgently on engines that have conducted a certain number of flights - would affect dozens of the double-decker jets.
The people said the suspect part was fabricated on behalf of consortium member Pratt & Whitney, which declined to comment. 
Engine Alliance is one of two engine suppliers for the Airbus A380 in competition with Britain’s Rolls-Royce (L:RR).
Its engines power a total of 152 aircraft or just over 60 percent of the 237 A380s in service.
Besides Air France, other airlines operating the A380 with Engine Alliance powerplants include Dubai's Emirates, Qatar Airways, Abu Dhabi-based Etihad and Korean Air.
The checks will involve taking some planes out of service outside their usual maintenance schedules, one source said.
Investigations are not complete and are likely to tackle other features such as the loads or physical forces at play. Experts say air accidents are rarely caused by isolated factors.
Europe's Airbus (PA:AIR) declined to comment.
SIOUX CITY REMEMBERED
Nobody was hurt in the September 2017 incident, in which the Air France superjumbo diverted safely to Goose Bay in Canada. 
Although rare, uncontained engine failures, in which shrapnel capable of puncturing the fuselage exits an engine at extremely high speeds, automatically raise alarm.
The checks come weeks after relatives marked 30 years since an engine failure left a United Airlines DC-10 with almost no control, culminating in the death of 111 out of the 296 people on board during an attempted landing at Sioux City, Iowa.
U.S. investigators cited a defective titanium alloy part and weak inspection procedures, although they also praised the ""highly commendable"" performance of the crew of flight 232. 
The July 1989 crash sped up improvements in manufacturing methods for titanium alloy. Experts say hidden internal defects in such parts are unusual but remain difficult to detect.

Titanium alloy is used widely in aerospace, which is the metal's biggest customer due to its strength compared to the weight of each part and its ability to handle high temperatures.

1518,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 21, 2019 01:15PM ET</span>",U.S. regulator votes to propose new guidelines on shareholder advisers,"By Jessica DiNapoli and Katanga Johnson
(Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday issued new guidance that aims to clarify how investors and advisory firms that cast ballots on their behalf should vote in corporate elections on issues like pay and diversity.
The guidance, which expands previous 2014 guidance on shareholder voting in corporate ballots, addresses some of the grievances U.S. corporations have long had about so-called proxy advisers, such as mistakes in reports the advisers issue on specific companies and conflicts of interest in their business models. 
The SEC voted 3-2 to publish the new guidance, with Democratic commissioners dissenting because it could add risks to shareholders' rights and costs for the proxy advisors. 
Proxy advisory firms including Institutional Shareholder Services Inc and Glass, Lewis & Co tell investors how to vote on governance issues in corporate elections and cast ballots on behalf of some asset managers. The role of proxy advisers has gained more attention in recent years as the firms have grown more influential on charged corporate issues like gun rights and climate change.
""What are the benefits to achieve here? We don't have investment advisers clamoring for advice or certainty on how to meet their fiduciary duties. We don't have (those) who use them - institutional investors - complaining that investment advisers are breaching those duties,"" said Commissioner Allison Herren Lee, a Democrat. ""So, what are we fixing by calling for increased issuer input and injecting cost into the process?""
Corporate trade groups, led by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, have complained that the advisers' recommendations are conflicted, and have been lobbying lawmakers and regulators to rein them in. 
""We commended the SEC for taking a critical first step in bringing much-needed oversight to proxy advisory firms,"" Tom Quaadman of the Chamber said in a statement. ""Proxy advisory firms have been riddled with conflicts of interest, failed to link advice with economic return or company-specific information, and lack process and transparency.""
ISS Chief Executive Officer Gary Retelny said in a statement that the firm was ""concerned that the guidance will hamper our ability to deliver"" its research to investors.
Both ISS and Glass could potentially seek legal action if they believe the guidance breaches federal law. The dissent of the two commissioners could help substantiate any case, according to legal experts.
The SEC's new guidance could also set the agency up for a clash with investors who worry the regulator may diminish their voting rights. 
""The SEC's guidance will harm the very investors the commission is charged to protect,"" said Rob Collins, senior advisor to the Council for Investor Rights and Corporate Accountability. ""Shareholders value their proxy advisors’ independent advice. Diminishing corporate accountability is simply a bad idea.""
The guidance lays out the considerations for investors when they retain a proxy adviser, including assessing the firm's conflicts of interests and potential mistakes in reports.
It also reinforces an ""anti-fraud"" provision for proxy advisers that bars omissions or misstatements in their reports or recommendations. 
The guidance also clarifies that clients, or asset owners such as pension funds, can instruct their investment managers to avoid voting on certain matters. Critics of proxy advisory firms say that investors have wrongly believed they must cast a vote for every share they own, leading investors to rely too much on the firms.
The SEC also plans to issue new rules on proxy advisers, signaling the firms could face further scrutiny.

""We look forward to building on these first steps to achieve even more progress,"" Jay Timmons, chief executive of the National Association of Manufacturers, said in a statement.

1524,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 21, 2019 12:53PM ET</span>",Lowe's shares jump as higher-spending customers drive profit beat,"By Uday Sampath Kumar
(Reuters) - Lowe's Cos Inc (N:LOW) shares surged over 11% on Wednesday as the home improvement chain's efforts to focus on higher-spending customers helped it beat quarterly profit estimates and gain ground on larger rival  Home Depot  Inc (N:HD).
Like Home Depot, Lowe's has been chasing plumbers, builders and carpenters who spend more than its core ""do-it-yourself"" shoppers, by stocking up on higher-end industrial products such as drills and power saws.
Home Depot also beat quarterly profit estimates on Tuesday buoyed by sales of big-ticket items, but warned that the U.S.-China trade drama would impact consumer demand and cut its full-year sales forecast.
Lowe's said the potential impact of U.S. tariffs on some Chinese imports set to take effect from Sept. 1 was baked in its full-year earnings forecast of $5.45 to $5.65 per share, which the company reaffirmed on Wednesday.
Lowe's has also modified certain sections in stores dedicating them specifically to higher-spending customers with staff, billing and parking facilities. Changes in its supply-chain and a new merchandising team have helped keep in-demand products in stock for longer.
Lowe's total average bill amount rose 3.2% to $77.97 in the quarter.
""Under Ellison, retail basics such as in-stocks, merchandising and customer service are all being improved,"" Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail said.
Marvin Ellison, who was the chief executive officer of J.C. Penney Co Inc (N:JCP) before taking the top job at Lowe's last year, has made these changes with his sights squarely set on closing the gap with Home Depot, the United States' largest home improvement chain.
Lowe's same-store sales growth outpaced Home Depot in the country for the second straight quarter, something that helped push the company's shares higher, according to Stifel analyst John Baugh.
For an interactive graphic on Lowe's U.S. same-store sales compared to Home Depot over the last three years, click here: (https://tmsnrt.rs/2Z7N02W)
However, Lowe's overall quarterly net sales of $20.99 billion, hurt by a drop in revenue from Canadian stores, was still about $10 billion shy of Home Depot's figure.
Lowe's executives added rising home prices were leading consumers to spend on renovations and upgrades to their existing homes, rather than investing in new properties, benefiting home improvement chains.
The company's same-store sale rose 2.3% in the second quarter ended Aug. 2, above expectations of a 1.8% increase, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Excluding items, the company earned $2.15 per share, beating estimates of $2.01."

""We've sent a proposal to the company with a suggested framework to take talks forward. If they agree to it, we've offered to call the strike off,"" BALPA General Secretary Brian Strutton told Reuters, after a UK court rejected Ryanair's bid to block planned strike action.

1526,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 21, 2019 12:46PM ET</span>","Exclusive: Two groups, one backed by China's Fosun, bid for NMC Health stake - sources","By Davide Barbuscia, Hadeel Al Sayegh and Stanley Carvalho
DUBAI/ABU DHABI (Reuters) - Two groups, including one backed by China's Fosun (HK:0656), have made competing offers to buy a 40% stake in London-listed NMC Health (L:NMC) worth up to $1.9 billion, four sources familiar with the deal said.
The target stake is jointly owned by the chairman of Abu Dhabi-based investment firm KBBO Group, Khalifa Butti Bin Omeir, UAE-based businessman Saeed Bin Butti Al Qebaisi, and Infinite Investment, a vehicle linked to the two men.
The deal, which shows the growing interest of Chinese companies in the Middle East, could allow the UAE-based investors to realize significant gains after they bought the stake in 2011 for $1 billion.
However, they may choose to retain at least some of their current holding in the company, the sources said. NMC Health's businesses include an extended portfolio of hospitals, day surgery centers, clinics and pharmacies across the UAE.
Its single biggest shareholder, B.R. Shetty, who is also the founder of the company, is not planning to sell his 19% stake, according to the sources.
The group is looking to pay a premium to NMC Health’s market price, two of the sources said. The stock is down about 30% year-to-date.
Neither NMC Health nor KBBO, which is representing the group of Emirati investors, would comment directly on the bids.
Prasanth Manghat, chief executive of NMC Health, said the firm is excited about its future prospects. ""Management is committed to all shareholders, and all actions if pertaining to us will be in best interest of all shareholders,"" he said.
A spokesman for KBBO said the shareholders ""are committed for the long term and want to see value for the company"".
Fosun, whose businesses include pharmaceuticals, industrial operations, asset management, and insurance, could not be immediately reached for a comment."

The memo, dated Wednesday and seen by Reuters, said that any new hires would require explicit approval from the bank's chief executive officer Christian Sewing, as well as his deputy Karl von Rohr and finance chief James von Moltke.
""Hiring will be restricted to positions that are viewed as critical to the bank's success and future growth, with a greater emphasis on internal mobility and identifying tasks we can discontinue,"" the memo said.
The final stamp of approval from the trio of board members is a shift from the past when subordinates had more say over external hires.

1531,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 21, 2019 11:47AM ET</span>",Target shares surge on same-day delivery boost,"By Aishwarya Venugopal
(Reuters) -  Target  Corp (NYSE:TGT) beat expectations for earnings and raised its full-year outlook on Wednesday as its investments in same-day delivery and pick-up services increased traffic to its website and stores, sending shares 19% higher.
The retailer has spent billions of dollars on its push to compete with the ease of delivery provided by Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc, buying grocery delivery firm Shipt, and building in-store pickup and drive-up services.
Target said one out of five customers who used its same-day service in the quarter were new, with shoppers collecting their orders from stores within a couple of minutes of placing them through the company's mobile app or website.
""Q2 could not have gone better for Target,"" Charlie O'Shea, a vice president at ratings agency Moody's, said of the results.
Led since 2014 by retail-industry veteran Brian Cornell, Target has bounced back from a slide three years ago which saw its margins drop, prompting a rethink that has seen it remodel hundreds of stores each year since. 
Like Walmart it has refitted its business to deal with the challenge presented by Amazon and other online retailers, also developing its line of own-brand goods to boost profits.
Wednesday's results showed the company's same-day services drove more than three-fourths of a 34% increase in comparable digital sales in the quarter. Those online sales accounted for more than half of its total same-store sales. 
""Because these options leverage our store infrastructure, technology and teams, same-day fulfillment delivers outstanding financial performance as well,"" Cornell told a post earnings call.
The company's stock, which had already risen 29% this year, jumped 19% to a record high of $102.02, driving gains in other retail players and adding to broad gains for Wall Street. 
NO MARGIN SLIP
The quicker deliveries, Target executives said, also powered profitability as margins expanded for the first time in nearly three years, rising 30 basis points to 30.6% in the quarter. 
That reflected a stronger product mix and optimization of pricing, the company said, at a time when Walmart's margins dropped 46 basis points. Macy's, Kohl's and J.C. Penney have all reported disappointing results in the past week.
""While many department store peers struggle to sustain positive traffic and stable gross margins, Target is finding the right balance,"" Evercore analyst Greg Melich said.
Target's comparable sales rose by a better-than-expected 3.4% as demand for apparel, toys and beauty products rose. Late in the quarter, the retailer also benefited from back-to-school promotions.
Its strategy of opening smaller locations in college towns and urban areas, and stocking more own-brand goods, helped store traffic grow 2.4%.
Earlier this week, the company said it was starting a new food and beverage brand, Good & Gather, that would hit stores in September. 
Target expects full-year adjusted profit to be between $5.90 and $6.20 per share, up from the prior range of $5.75 to $6.05 per share. The outlook accounted for potential additional U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports.

Excluding certain items, it earned $1.82 per share, beating the average analyst estimate by 20 cents. Total revenue rose 3.6% to $18.42 billion, above expectations of $18.34 billion.

The amendment to the U.S.-Japan Open Skies Agreement allocates 12 new slot pairs - 12 arrivals and 12 departures daily - for U.S. air carriers and 12 new slot pairs for Japanese air carriers.
Tokyo International Airport, also known as Haneda, is the main gateway into Japan as it is closer to the city center than Narita, the other main airport that serves the city.
The department announced earlier this month that  American Airlines Group  Inc (O:AAL) will get flights from Dallas/Fort Worth and Los Angeles; Delta Air Lines (N:DAL) won flights from Seattle, Detroit, Atlanta, Portland, Ore., and Honolulu; Hawaiian Airlines a flight from Honolulu, and United Airlines (O:UAL) flights from Newark, N.J., Chicago O’Hare, Washington-Dulles and Los Angeles.
The flight services are expected to begin around March 29, 2020, with the beginning of the Summer 2020 season, and in time for the Tokyo 2020 Summer Olympics.
The new flights were possible after the United States struck a deal with Japan in January to let commercial flights use airspace controlled by its forces in Japan. The extra capacity will help Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s government make tourism a pillar of growth and to boost arrivals by 28 percent from last year, to 40 million by 2020."

OSLO (Reuters) - The liquidity of Britain's short-term power markets is likely to fall by 10-20% if the country leaves the European Union without a deal at the end of October, a senior executive at the EPEX SPOT power exchange told Reuters.
Britain is due to leave the European Union on Oct. 31. If it does so without a deal, it would no longer be coupled to European power markets. In the case of a deal, however, cross-border trading will not be affected during a transition period agreed with the EU.
The intraday and day-ahead markets are among the most liquid products of a power exchange. They represent power that is traded for use within the same day and electricity for physical delivery the following day.
The high liquidity means that any loss of transaction volumes would hit profit at the power exchanges.
""For our traders, it is clearly a disadvantage ... (A no-deal Brexit) is likely to have an effect on the liquidity of the market, particularly on the day-ahead time frame,"" said EPEX SPOT's director for public and regulatory affairs, Wolfram Vogel.
Market liquidity would fall by 10-20% for intraday and day-ahead power trading combined, Vogel said without elaborating on how long it would take for the market to recover.
EPEX did not have a detailed plan to compensate for any lost liquidity, a spokeswoman said.
Cross-border day-ahead transactions in their current form will stop, added Vogel, and EPEX SPOT would instead organize local day-ahead auctions in Britain.
Trading within-day electricity with Ireland, however, would remain unaffected, he said.
EPEX SPOT is working on expanding in the Nordics and Vogel said the exchange's within-day and day-ahead operations in the region are likely to begin between November and January.
A Norwegian license to operate day-ahead power trading is still pending, he said, together with more technical details that need to be finalised with the Nordic transmission system operators.
EPEX SPOT is in contact with members that already trade in the Nordics, Vogel added, and its sales team is working on adding new customers, offering participation fee discounts.
EPEX's parent, EEX, is Deutsche Boerse's (DE:DB1Gn) flagship power derivatives market. EEX already trades financial power derivative contracts in the Nordics, competing with Nasdaq (O:NDAQ) in the futures market.
The start of operations in the Nordics will mean the end of Nord Pool's local monopoly in intraday and day-ahead trading."

In June, the No.2 U.S. homebuilder  Lennar  Corp (N:LEN) flagged weakness in the region and warned that more tariffs on Chinese imports could increase raw material costs and dent margin.
As the trade war continues to stoke fears of a recession, analysts say they expect California deceleration to hurt Toll's full-year 2020 top line and margins given the nine to 12 months delivery cycle on orders.
""The revenue mix from California (for Toll) will likely decline through fiscal 2020. This is the biggest impediment for the stock, in our view,"" said RBC Capital Markets analyst Mike Dahl.
Toll's customers include high net worth individuals who are more sensitive to stock market volatility compared to builders such as D.R. Horton (N:DHI) which targets first-time buyers.
California made up about 30% of Toll's home sales in the nine months ended July 31, for fiscal year 2019."
1536,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 21, 2019 10:56AM ET</span>",Trump criticizes automakers for not backing fuel economy rollback,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump chastised automakers on Wednesday for not backing his administration's plan to roll back Obama-era fuel efficiency rules.
Last month,  Ford Motor Co  (N:F), Honda Motor Co (T:7267), BMW AG (DE:BMWG) and Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p) reached a voluntary agreement with California on fuel efficiency rules, defying Trump and his administration's effort to strip the state of the right to fight climate change by setting its own standards.
The White House has urged other automakers not to back the California agreement, while Democrats have been calling and writing automakers urging them to sign on with California.
The Environmental Protection Agency on Tuesday ridiculed the voluntary framework, which it said ""so far has been nothing more than a press release.""
""My proposal to the politically correct Automobile Companies would lower the average price of a car to consumers by more than $3000, while at the same time making the cars substantially safer. Engines would run smoother. Very little impact on the environment! Foolish executives!"" Trump tweeted.
Gloria Bergquist, a spokeswoman for the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, representing General Motors Co (N:GM), Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203), Ford, Volkswagen and others, said the companies ""look forward to seeing a final rule soon. We support increases to standards that optimize all the priorities, including affordability so more Americans can buy a new car, plus preserving jobs and safety at the same time.""
Sierra Club Executive Director Michael Brune said Trump's tweet was completely untrue. ""Trump’s rollback is unraveling from every corner,"" he said.
All major automakers are on record saying they oppose the administration's ""preferred option"" announced in August 2018, which would freeze fuel economy requirements at 2020 levels through 2026.
Trump's tweet misstated some aspects of the administration's proposal, expected to be finalized sometime after late September. The proposal said that by the 2030 model year, the average price increase of a new vehicle would be reduced by $1,850 and consumers would pay $490 less for financing, insurance and taxes. There is nothing in the administration's proposed revisions that would result in engines running more smoothly, experts say.
The Trump plan’s preferred alternative would hike U.S. oil consumption by about 500,000 barrels per day in the 2030s but reduce automakers’ collective regulatory costs by more than $300 billion. It would bar California from requiring automakers to sell a rising number of electric vehicles or setting state emissions rules.
The administration says the increased fuel use would hike the average global temperature by 3/1000th of one degree
Celsius by 2100, but would also save thousands of lives over the next 30 years -- in part because consumers would more quickly buy safer, cheaper vehicles. Environmentalists and many states reject that analysis.
The Obama-era rules adopted in 2012 called for a fleetwide fuel efficiency average of 46.7 miles per gallon by 2025, with average annual increases of about 5%, compared with 37 mpg by 2026 under the Trump administration’s preferred option."

It is the latest attempt to break a deadlock in Uniper and Fortum's long-running talks over their future relationship strained by the Finnish group's efforts to acquire a majority in Uniper against its will.
Russian regulators also bar Fortum from raising its stake from the current 49.99% in Uniper because of a water license the German group operates there, which, according to local law, cannot be majority owned by a state-owned entity.
On Tuesday, ratings agency S&P said that Fortum acquiring more of Uniper could be negative for the ratings of both groups. Currently, S&P has a 'BBB' rating on both Uniper and Fortum, two notches above junk.
""The S&P report confirms our fears that Fortum has bitten off more than it can chew through the takeover of Uniper,"" Holger Grzella, Uniper's deputy works council head, told Reuters on Wednesday.
""We want to avoid a further negative impact on Uniper at all costs.
Workers fear that Fortum Chief Executive Pekka Lundmark could break up the group if he gets a majority, something Fortum has denied. They accuse him of not being clear about his future intentions with regard to Uniper.
""We have made a constructive proposal for a cooperation on the basis of the status quo. Lundmark has simply ignored it,"" Grzella said.
""It is high time to leave the destructive path taken by Mr Lundmark and work together constructively on the basis of the status quo (no stake increase),"" he said.
Lundmark regularly meets with his counterpart at Uniper, Andreas Schierenbeck, who said earlier this month that talks were constructive but complex, with less flexibility with respect to the water license.
Activist fund Knight Vinke, which owns 5.02% in Uniper, said it would call an extraordinary general meeting in September to table a spin-off of Uniper's Russian operations if the two companies remain in deadlock."

""It's correct, there is a draft for a police report,"" spokesman for the Financial Supervisory Authority (FSA), Soren Christensen, told Reuters.
According to Danish daily Jyllands-Posten, which first reported the story, the information prepared for the police is still subject to approval by FSA management.
 Danske Bank  declined to comment on ongoing investigations.
The FSA said in June it was investigating the bank for failing to inform customers that it expected a poor performance from its Flexinvest Fri investment product, and for continuing to sell it to new customers.
""At the time when the bank sold the product, it expected customers' return after fees to be less than the zero-percent rate on their deposit accounts,"" the FSA said in June.
Danske, which fired former interim CEO and head of its domestic bank Jesper Nielsen as a result of the scandal, said in June it would compensate 87,000 Flexinvest Fri customers, costing the bank around 400 million Danish crowns ($60 million).
The dismissal of Nielsen was the first major change since CEO Chris Vogelzang took charge in June with a mission to restore trust in the lender after its involvement in a major money laundering scandal."

(NYSE:TGT) are signaling that the all-important American consumer is doing just fine.
The big-box discount retailers both beat sales expectations for the second quarter and raised their profit guidance for the full year, shrugging off concerns about tariffs, encroachment from Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN). and dispiriting results from retail peers like Macy’s Inc., J.C. Penney Co. and Kohl’s Corp. Paired with bullish comments on the U.S. housing market this week from  Home Depot  Inc (NYSE:HD). and Lowe’s Corp., the outlook heading into the critical holiday period looks brighter.
“The consumer economy continues to motor along nicely,” said Neil Saunders, an analyst at Global DataRetail. “Home improvement is an early indicator of economic distress and from Home Depot’s numbers, there was no sign that the consumer is in a tailspin. Target and Walmart, both bellwethers for mainstream America, point to the same conclusion.”
Standing Out
Walmart, Target and Home Depot -- along with a few other recent star performers like Costco Wholesale Corp (NASDAQ:COST). and  Best Buy  Co (NYSE:BBY)., who report in the coming weeks -- have stood out by nailing the fundamentals of retail: price, assortment and convenience. Their products are affordable, with enough new stuff to keep people coming back, along with plenty of online buying options that appeal to busy shoppers. Plus their size and clout give them a leg up in negotiating tariff impacts with suppliers that smaller rivals don’t have.
Take Target, which is remodeling 300 stores this year and has introduced about two dozen private and exclusive brands in key categories like apparel, home decor and booze. Or Walmart, which has figured out curbside fulfillment of grocery orders and will start offering in-home deliveries directly to shoppers’ fridges this fall. Those offers make them unique in the sea of sameness that has let Amazon and digital upstarts grab market share from other retailers in recent years.
Target shares surged as much as 18% in premarket trading after reporting results Wednesday and are poised to open at a record high. Lowe’s rose as much as 13%.
A recent survey of shoppers from analysts at Stifel confirms their appeal. More than eight out of 10 shoppers polled in late July said they plan to shop at Walmart in the next month, up from 71% who said the same two years ago. Target enjoyed a similar rate of increase in so-called shopping intention. More than one-quarter of consumers said they plan to spend more on discretionary items -- stuff they want but don’t necessarily need -- in the coming months, well above the 16% average over the past seven years.
“Our data suggests the U.S. consumer remains strong,” Stifel’s Mark Astrachan said in a note.
Comments from retail-industry leaders echoed that sentiment. Lowe’s Chief Executive Officer Marvin Ellison said Wednesday that the home-improvement retailer’s gains in the quarter reflected “a solid macroeconomic backdrop.” Walmart’s finance chief Brett Biggs said last week American consumers were in “relatively good shape.”
Department-Store Doom
Still, some retailers are floundering. Traditional department-store chains like Macy’s and J.C. Penney turned in a dour set of results, and the next round of tariffs on Chinese goods -- poised to hit nearly all apparel -- could send them reeling even more. A levy on department-store staples like handbags already went into effect, with the vast majority of other products slated for hikes later this year, even after a partial reprieve.
It’s not just tariffs: Unfavorable weather in the early spring kept shoppers from buying summer swimsuits and outdoor gear, pummeling performance for the stores that rely on those seasonal products. To goose sales, both Macy’s and J.C. Penney have inked deals with online consignment outlet thredUP, which reflects the weak demand for the fashions currently on their racks. Shoppers have already gone elsewhere, particularly younger ones.
The bottom line is that consumers are still spending, but they’re getting more choosy and cautious, which is why even discounter TJX (NYSE:TJX) Cos. posted a rare stumble after failing to freshen up the assortment at its HomeGoods chain, forcing it to discount items. The miss at what’s traditionally an earnings standout showed how little margin for error there is in today’s unforgiving retail world."

AMS plans to buy Osram in a deal that would value the bigger German lighting group at 4.3 billion euros ($4.8 billion), trumping a competing bid by Bain Capital and  Carlyle Group  (O:CG). To be able to do so, Osram must waive a standstill agreement. 
Osram's supervisory board is expected to discuss the issue at a meeting later on Wednesday.
""A waiver of the standstill agreement is to be expected,"" one of the sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.
The decision would come virtually at the last minute for AMS, which has to give German watchdog Bafin 10 days to examine and approve its offer before it can launch it, but wants to do so before Bain & Carlyle's offer period ends on Sept. 5. 

If the Austrian group does not manage to submit its own bid before the other one expires, the finance investors could increase their bid to win over shareholders, and AMS has no chance to react.

1552,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 21, 2019 08:01AM ET</span>",Luxury Homebuilder's Woes Show Mounting U.S. Slowdown Fears,"(Bloomberg) -- Wealthy buyers are pulling back from some of the most expensive housing markets in the U.S., the latest sign that sky-high prices and fears of a recession are weighing on a key sector of the economy.
Toll Brothers Inc., the nation’s largest publicly traded luxury-home builder, said late Tuesday that purchase agreements fell 3% from a year earlier, worse than a decline of less than 1% that was expected by a Bloomberg survey of six analysts. The company’s orders in California, home to some of the priciest markets in the country, tumbled 36% from a year earlier.
The results underscore a shift taking place in the U.S. housing market. The return of low mortgage rates is heating up competition for starter homes and fueling steep price gains in cities that have long been more affordable. Meanwhile, expensive markets, like San Jose and Seattle, as well as the luxury homes that Toll builds, have seen a drop-off in demand.
“Their buyers are a little more sensitive to what’s going on in the broader economy,” said Drew Reading, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. “They’re paying more attention to the stock market.”
Slowdown Signs
Wall Street and Washington have been buzzing this month about the potential for an economic slowdown after U.S. equities suffered one of the deepest sell-offs of the year on Aug. 14 and a key portion of the U.S. Treasury yield curve inverted for the first time in 12 years. New-home sales also were weaker than expected in June.
Homebuilders that cater to entry-level buyers are better positioned to weather shifting demand, Reading said. Shares of D.R. Horton Inc., which focuses on starter homes, have climbed 41% this year, while Toll Brothers is up 12%. The stock slipped 1.9% in premarket trading Wednesday.
The luxury builder’s biggest challenge may be its concentration in California, where its homes under contract had an average price of $1.74 million in the quarter. Chinese buyers have pulled back there and the federal tax overhaul limited deductions for property levies and mortgage interest.
As at other homebuilders, Toll’s profits have gotten squeezed by the need to drive sales with buyer incentives. Fewer California deals, with their relatively fat margins, also didn’t help. Toll’s full-year guidance for adjusted gross margin of 23% was slightly lower than the consensus of 23.2%, based on a Bloomberg survey of analysts.
‘Tailwinds’ Intact
Toll is off to a good start in the current quarter that started Aug. 1, Chief Executive Officer Doug Yearley said in the earnings statement.
“Low mortgage rates, a limited supply of new and existing homes, and a strong employment picture are providing tailwinds,” he said.
The company has been looking to scale up its business in other parts of the country and build less-expensive homes.
“They are diversifying the type of product they’re building, but it’s not a transformation that happens overnight,” said Alex Barron, an analyst with the Housing Research Center in El Paso, Texas. “Toll Brothers is luxury. They’re not going to go from being a Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN) to being Walmart (NYSE:WMT).”

1553,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 21, 2019 07:56AM ET</span>","AirPods Maker Sales Surge 79%, With More Growth Expected","(Bloomberg) -- Luxshare Precision Industry Co. drew a series of analyst price upgrades after the Chinese assembler of Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL).’s AirPods revealed a roughly 80% surge in first-half profit and sales.
The company, regarded as a bellwether for China’s consumer hardware industry, is expected to become an increasingly important supplier of components for wearable devices like the Apple Watch, some analysts say. Goldman, CICC and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) were among the investment houses that lifted their stock price target on the consumer hardware firm after it posted results late Tuesday.
Luxshare is among the largest of a crop of Chinese manufacturers of consumer electronics that’re increasingly winning orders from longer-established firms like Foxconn Technology Group. The Shenzhen-based firm has in past years become a primary supplier of AirPods, one of the fastest-selling consumer accessories in the market. TF International analyst Kuo Ming-chi estimates AirPod shipments could rise 60%-70% for 2019, and 50%-60% for 2020.
“Luxshare is in a fast-growth phase thanks to its comprehensive product lines and expertise in R&D and production of precision electronic components, which provide a defensive moat,” Csc International analyst Zhu Jixiang said. “Apple’s AirPods in particular are a bright spot in the market, and Luxshare has a significant share of assembling that product.”
Luxshare’s stock slid 2% on Wednesday but Bright Smart Securities analyst Mark Huang blamed that partly on a conservative projection for current-quarter net income growth of 18% to 38%. Huang said any losses presented a buying opportunity.
Only 1 of 32 analysts covering the company rated it a sell, according to Bloomberg-compiled data (the rest were Buys). Its blended 12-month price-earnings ratio of 27 compared with an average of 24 for the past two years.
“Luxshare again produced a solid set of numbers. Any back-sliding in the stock presents a chance to buy,” Bright Smart’s Huang said. “Today’s fall may stem from a temporary valuation adjustment, after a portion of capital chose to lock in profits.”

Analysts’ optimism aside, the Chinese company itself warned Tuesday about the uncertain impact of global trade ructions.
Trump-administration tariffs on Chinese-made products, including eventually a swathe of consumer and mobile electronics, will pressure contract manufacturers’ margins and accelerate a costly shift of capacity away from China over time . An economic downturn could also depress demand for electronics more generally.
Luxshare can counter some of those headwinds due to its strong capability of manufacturing precision instruments and expectations of new wave of 5G-driven demand, Huang said.
“Its growth prospects will expand in the 5G era, along with demand for mobile peripherals,” he said."

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thai chemicals company Indorama Ventures (BK:IVL) has committed $1.5 billion of investment in recycling as consumers become more aware of the environmental impact of single-use plastic and regulators push for more recycling, it said on Wednesday.
Indorama's main business is the production of PET resin, a polymer used to make plastic bottles and fibers used in products such as seat belts and tyres.
In the 12 months to June 30 the company produced nearly 5,000 kilotons of PET.
""We are investing $1 billion in recycling over the next five years,"" Chief Executive Aloke Lohia told Reuters on Wednesday, adding that investment would include greenfield and brownfield mergers and acquisitions focusing on bottle-to-bottle recycling.
Indorama has 11 recycling sites around the world, including plants in Thailand, Mexico and France, and aims to step up its green credentials in response to new regulation being rolled out by governments as well as changing expectations from customers.
In March the European Commission announced a target to incorporate 25% of recycled plastic in PET bottles by 2025, with a targeted 90% collection rate.
After 2023 Indorama plans to invest an additional $500 million by 2025 to help its customers to achieve the 25% target, Lohia added.
Indian-born Lohia started Indorama in Thailand in 1994 with about 200 employees. The company has since grown to employ 18,000 people across 31 countries.
""There is infrastructure in the world to recycle PET. The problem lies in the collection,"" he said.
Consultancy Wood Mackenzie Chemicals estimates that the collection rate for PET beverage bottles in the European Union was about 58% in 2017.
About 40 percent of Indorama's revenue is from North America and about 30 percent from Europe.
Indorama, which counts Coca-Cola (N:KO), PepsiCo (O:PEP) and Nestle (S:NESN) among its customers, said it is working with brand owners and governments to allow more bottle-to-bottle recycling.
The acquisitive company still has $2.5 billion of uncommitted capital for new projects in its other businesses, including olefin, fibers and feedstocks, Lohia said.
Indorama this month bought  Huntsman  Corp's (N:HUN) chemical intermediates businesses in Australia, India and the U.S. state of Texas for about $2.1 billion, beefing up its midstream operations."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Online resale store thredUP said on Wednesday it received $175 million in funding which it will use to expand its platform to offer resale clothing services to retailers. 
Last week, the department store chains J.C. Penney Company Inc (N:JCP) and Macy's Inc (N:M) announced partnerships with San Francisco-based thredUP intended to lure younger, more environmentally conscious shoppers into stores and to provide retailers fresh inventory of secondhand clothing and accessories.
They are among legacy retailers who have faced fierce competition from online giants like Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) and discount retailers like TJX Cos Inc's (N:TJX) Marshalls and T.J. Maxx chains.
thredUP Chief Executive James Reinhart told Reuters the roughly 10-year-old company is in ""active conversations"" with ""dozens of retailers"" about how they can help them tap into a $24 billion apparel resale market.
""The conversation from our end is: 'Look, you guys need a strategy, this is what young people are doing... and if you're a retailer and you're not ambitiously trying to figure out how to be a part of this, you're going to wake up one day and wonder what the hell happened,'"" Reinhart said.
Online resale will grow as much as 10 to 15 times faster than fast fashion stores such as Zara, department stores such as Macy's, and traditional off-price chains like T.J. Maxx, according to Cowen & Co estimates.
In addition to providing the online and in-store services for buying and selling secondhand apparel for retailers and brands, the funding will also be used toward improving in-house logistics and marketing, according to company executives. The funds will bring thredUP's total capital raised to more than $300 million.
Reinhart said thredUP has for the most part turned to Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) for advertising, targeting people already in the mood to shop. Now, the company will focus more on TV and out-of-home advertising, it said.
Consumers download the thredUP app or go onto the resale site and then ship their used apparel, handbags, shoes and jewelry items from more than 35,000 brands such as J.Crew and Old Navy. Company employees receive the items, process them, make sure they're in good condition, price them algorithmically, photograph them and ship them out to shoppers when sold.
The company re-sells clothes at up to 90% off retail prices and takes a cut of each sale, the company said, declining to provide revenue figures.
Downloads of thredUP's app from January to July 2019 totaled 578,000, up 71% from the same time period in 2018, according to analytics firm SimilarWeb. Daily active users on the app reached its peak this past July at 19,000. 

The company currently has five distribution centers and plans to open a sixth by the end of this year or beginning of next year. By year's end, thredUP will have processed 100 million used items, the company said.

Fund returned 3%, or 256 billion kroner ($28.5 billion)Stocks rose 3.0%, bonds 3.1% and real estate 0.8%Fund held 69.3% in equities, 28.0% in bonds and 2.7% in real estate“Uncertainty about global trade and economic growth dampened returns early on, but markets rallied toward the end of the period driven partly by the prospect of more expansionary monetary policy in developed markets,” Norges Bank Investment Management’s Deputy Chief Executive Officer Trond Grande said in a statement.
The Oslo-based fund, which holds 1.4% of global stocks on average, closely mirrors the broad markets, though it has some leeway in how it weighs indexes and strays from its benchmarks. The fund snapped up stocks in a selloff at the end of last year, then hitting its long-term target of 70% in equities.
The investor, built from Norway’s oil and gas riches, has pared losses from 2018 but faces a tough market outlook amid a turbulent month.
The fund said it has more than 600 billion kroner in bonds with negative yields, or about a quarter of its fixed-income portfolio, adding pressure as it struggles to keep up with its 3% real return target.
The largest stock holdings at the end of the quarter were  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT)., Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN). Its largest bond holdings were in U.S. Treasuries, followed by Japanese and German government debt.
In the second quarter, the government deposited 6 billion kroner into the fund, down from 8 billion kroner in the first quarter.

JPMorgan raised its rating on Beyond Meat to overweight from neutral and lifted its target price to $189 a share from $188 a share, sending shares 6% higher. 
The stock has slumped 40% since its high on July 26, making its valuation more palatable, JPMorgan said. 
As well as an attractive valuation, continued signs of rising dollar takeaway growth (a measure of performance in the food sector) and the potential to acquire new food-service customers were outlined as supportive factors. 
In a sign Beyond Meat’s products are catching on with consumers, the dollar takeaway for the company was up 186% year over year in the last 13 weeks, the highest in nearly three years, JPMorgan) said, citing Nielsen data.
The bank also suggested that current estimates on the plant-based burger market were undervaluing the company somewhat as they failed to incorporate sales of the company’s products to the Tim Horton's, Dunkin' Donuts (NASDAQ:DNKN) and Uno's chains and Aramark (NYSE:ARMK), which operates cafeterias in schools, businesses and other locations. 
The decline in shares of Beyond Meat) arrived after the company reported wider-than-expected losses last month and a surprise secondary offering. 
But JPMorgan's note said the selloff was somewhat overdone as only a small proportion of shares were placed in the offering. 
""We appreciate that the secondary offering spooked many investors; however, founder/CEO Ethan Brown trimmed only a tiny portion of his holdings, and we cannot blame anyone involved pre-IPO for locking in some gains,"" JPMorgan said.

1563,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 21, 2019 05:41AM ET</span>","Exclusive: Humbled Noble Group seeks to rebuild LNG, energy businesses: sources","By Anshuman Daga and Jessica Jaganathan
SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Noble Group Holdings (Noble Holdings) plans to rebuild its liquefied natural gas (LNG) and core energy businesses and develop rare earths as it seeks new life as a niche, Asia-focused commodity trader, sources aware of the matter said.
""We have enough credit lines to expand the LNG business. In our restructuring, we made sure we had ample credit facilities, so we could build the business that we lost,"" said one senior executive with the company, which took over assets of the under-liquidation Noble Group Ltd (SI:NOBG).
Noble Holdings has now set up a Singapore desk for LNG by hiring a former trader from Australia's Origin Energy (AX:ORG), expanding its four-person LNG team in London, industry sources told Reuters.
""The company has always had an LNG team but activities were wound down for a while and are now starting back up,"" one of the sources said, declining to be named as the person was not authorized to speak with the media.
Three LNG traders including two co-heads of the team had left Noble in 2016 to join rival  Glencore  (L:GLEN). It also sold its U.S. gas and power business to another rival, Mercuria.
The new Singapore LNG desk will focus on trading, the source said. The restart of the desk has not been previously reported.
""We've been in a process to prove to the market that Noble is a viable enterprise and can continue to fulfill contracts,"" the company executive said, using a 3-year trade finance facility of $700 million secured as part of its restructure.
Noble, once Asia's biggest commodity trader, saw its market value all but wiped out from $6 billion in February 2015 after Iceberg Research issued reports accusing it of inflating its assets.
To rescue itself, Noble sold billions of dollars of assets, took hefty writedowns and cut hundreds of jobs over the last few years, although it defended its accounting practices.
As Noble faced insolvency protection, shareholders approved a $3.5 billion debt restructuring deal that completed in December and left them owning just 20 percent, with creditors taking majority control.
Noble Holdings, whose portfolio comprises a trading division dealing in energy coal, LNG, base metals and other products, declined comment. Another division houses its investments in alumina company Jamalco and U.S. based oil and gas producer Harbour Energy and other businesses.
The company is also recruiting for roles including analysts for base metals and coke, and a sales trader to market energy products in Japan, sources said.
Technology metals or rare earths are expected to be a focus area for Noble Holdings, which through its subsidiary took a small stake in ambitious Australian rare earths developer Arafura Resources (AX:ARU) this year. The executive said Noble Holdings is eyeing other opportunities in the sector.
In the first half of 2019, Noble Holdings reported a net profit of $46.4 million. Employing about 280 staff, it has been gradually building up its trading teams by hiring in Singapore and Hong Kong.
In December, Singapore authorities blocked the listing of the restructured company amid a regulatory probe."

LONDON (Reuters) - European stocks opened higher on Wednesday as hopes for more monetary and fiscal stimulus helped assuage worries about global recession, political turmoil in Italy and endless trade wars.
Traders are waiting for the Federal Reserve's annual JacksonHole symposium later this week and a Group of Seven summit this weekend for clues on what steps policymakers will take to boost economic growth.
Much depends on what the Fed does with U.S. interest rates, making markets hyper-sensitive to the minutes - due later on Wednesday - of its last meeting. 
""People are looking ahead to Jackson Hole later this week and the message that [Fed Chairman] Jerome Powell may or may not give us on the direction of monetary policy. That is the highlight of the week and we are waiting with baited breath,"" said Andrew Milligan, head of global strategy at Aberdeen Standard Investments. 
Futures <0#FF:> are fully priced for a quarter-point cut in rates next month and cuts of more than 100 basis points by the end of next year.
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) economist Ellen Zentner advised clients to watch for the use of the word ""somewhat"" when Powell describes future policy. 
""Acknowledgment that downside risks have increased with no characterization of 'somewhat' could be taken as confirmation that it is likely the Fed makes a larger cut in September,""Zentner wrote in a note.
With so much riding on the Fed, investors were cautious and volumes subdued. The Euro STOXX 600 was 0.6% higher, with Italy outperforming after a rout yesterday following the resignation of Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte.
Shares in Milan-listed Fiat Chrysler climbed 3.1% after Italian media reported that talks between Fiat and  Renault  (PA:RENA) never stopped. That put the STOXX 600 Autos Index on track for its best day in a month.
GEA Group, a German food-processing-machinery company, and outsourcing group Capita gained more than 5% after Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) upgraded its rating on the stocks. 
President Donald Trump showed no signs of backing down in his tussle with China, declaring on Tuesday a confrontation was necessary even if it hurt the U.S. economy in the short term.
Shortly afterward, the U.S. government approved an $8 billion sale of  Lockheed Martin  (NYSE:LMT) F-16 fighter jets to Taiwan, a move sure to draw Beijing's ire and further dim prospects for a trade deal.
Political turmoil in Italy, Britain and Hong Kong has also heightened uncertainties.
Italian bond yields steadied after falling on Tuesday, as Italian President Sergio Mattarella begins two days of talks that will lead either to formation of the country's 67th government since World War Two or to early elections.
Germany bond yields rose before the sale of new 30-year government bonds that could test investor demand for deeply negative bond yields. Germany plans to sell 2 billion euros of the new bond, with a 0% coupon.
MORE STIMULUS
Alarm bells started ringing last week when yields on U.S.10-year notes fell below two-year yields for the first time since 2007, an inversion that has preceded previous recessions. That was enough to prompt Trump's administration to look for ways to stimulate the U.S. economy.
In addition, the central banks of the euro zone, Australia and China are all expected loosen monetary policy some more this year. Germany is considering fiscal stimulus.
Those prospects have driven yields lower. Benchmark U.S.10-year Treasury yields stood at 1.57% on Wednesday, down from a high of 1.625% on Monday.
Currency markets were mostly subdued. The euro struggled was last down 0.1% at $1.1092. The dollar, measured against a basket of currencies, rose 0.1% to 98.265.

1565,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 21, 2019 05:12AM ET</span>","StockBeat: Italian Political Talks, German Tax Cut Drive Gains","By Geoffrey Smith
Investing.com -- Italy’s stock market got its mojo back on Wednesday after investors took the view that the latest political crisis may not lead inevitably to the broader European one that many fear.
The FTSE MIB led Europe’s markets higher after early trading, rising 1.4% to a two-week high after the resignation of Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte left the country temporarily without a government.
Other markets followed Italy higher after a report that the German government had agreed a draft law largely scrapping the so-called “Solidarity Surcharge” on income tax. That’s Berlin’s biggest move yet to support an economy that is slowing down under a combination of trade-related pressures. The so-called ""Soli"" generated nearly 20 billion euros for the government last year.
By 5 AM ET (0900 GMT), the benchmark Euro STOXX 600 was up 1.1% at 375.32, while the FTSE MIB was up 1.7% and the German DAX climbed 1.1%. The U.K. FTSE 100 rose 1.0%.
President Sergio Mattarella will now conduct two days of talks with the various parties in parliament to see if another majority can be formed. If not, his choices effectively boil down to either calling new elections, or installing a government of technocrats to oversee the passage of a budget for 2020, before calling elections in the spring.
The latter is the likelier option, says Florian Hense, an economist with Berenberg Bank in Berlin. That’s because it means the technocrats, rather than any of the country’s biggest parties, will be saddled with the unpopular task of finding 20 billion euros in savings in the next budget. Under legislation already in place, if those savings aren’t found, then a 3 percentage point increase in value added tax will come into force.
Hense puts a 50% chance on the above scenario. The second-most likely scenario, he says, would be of the 5 Stars Movement patching up its differences with the center-left Democratic Party and agreeing to form a new government. 
Either of those would put off what the market fears most - snap elections which put the right-wing populist Lega party of Matteo Salvini in power, either on its own or with other like-minded anti-immigrant and Euroskeptic parties.
“The stronger Salvini would be, the noisier the conflict with the EU over the 2020 budget could become, Hense said in a note to clients, adding that this could cause a fresh surge in bond yields.
“To avoid a major confrontation with the EU and keep bond yields at affordable levels, Salvini would have to perform a major U-turn,” Hense argued in a note to clients.
Gains in the bond markets have, as usual helped bank stocks since Conte’s speech.   Intesa Sanpaolo   (MI:ISP) was up 1.3%, while Unicredit (MI:CRDI) was up 1.4%. However, the biggest gains were among smaller names, widely perceived as weaker than the big two. UBI Banca (MI:UBI) was up 2.6%, while Banco Bpm (MI:BAMI) was up 1.9% and  Mediobanca  (MI:MDBI) up 1.8%.
However, the biggest gains had little to do with politics: Fiat Chrysler rose 3.8% and the Agnelli family holding company Exor rose 3.3% on the back of a report suggesting that the company is still talking to France’s   Renault   (PA:RENA) about a prospective merger."
1566,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 21, 2019 05:09AM ET</span>",China Traders Bet Big on a Lagging Bank Stock in Hong Kong,"(Bloomberg) -- It’s trading near its lowest levels since 2016 and has lost $44 billion in value since an April peak -- but mainland investors can’t seem to get enough of China Construction Bank Corp.
The Hong Kong-listed shares of the lender, one of China’s big four state-controlled banks, have seen mainland inflows of HK$6.2 billion ($790 million) over the past 19 sessions through Aug. 14, based on the latest data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s more than 17% of Chinese investors’ total spending during the buying streak.
A low valuation and healthy dividend yield make it attractive, said Terry Sun, a Hong Kong-based analyst with CMB International Securities Ltd. China Construction Bank’s A shares traded at about a 40% premium over the Hong Kong-listed shares last week, the biggest gap among the big four lenders.
China’s central bank introduced a revamped market benchmark rate this week aimed at lowering borrowing costs for households and companies to support the economy. While that’s seen to bring down industry rates, Sun expects the bank’s net interest margin to be more stable than peers, and says its large proportion of retail loans will help shield it from the impact.
Personal banking contributed to nearly 40% of China Construction Bank’s revenues for last year, the highest ratio among the big four lenders, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The stock rose as much as 1.4% in Hong Kong on Wednesday.
Hong Kong was the world’s worst-performing major stock market over the past month, roiled by weeks of protests, a weakening yuan and the fallout from the China- U.S. trade war. That has helped bring valuations on the Hang Seng Index down towards the lowest since late 2016, encouraging the buying streak from mainland investors.
China Construction Bank traded at a record low of below 0.64 times book value earlier this month, and its estimated dividend yield is at 6.2%, higher than that of Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd., the nation’s biggest lender and another favourite of mainland investors.
Further upside is expected in the coming months, with earnings to offer encouragement, said Wang Zhen, an analyst with UOB-Kay Hian Holdings Ltd. “As an industry leader, the bank has strong ability to adapt to and withstand the unfavourable macro-environment. The stock should perform well in the coming months.”

The five-day strike called by Portugal's SNPVAC union is the first of a wave of planned walkouts by unions in Ireland, Britain and Spain. It comes a year after strikes over pay and conditions forced Europe's largest low cost carrier to cancel hundreds of flights.
Ryanair said on Tuesday a small number of fights from its Portuguese bases might be affected by minor schedule changes and that affected customers had been notified. There are no delays or cancellations reported so far at Lisbon, Porto and Faro airports.
Management say significant progress has been made since last year's strikes, with collective labor agreements concluded with a number of pilot unions throughout Europe.
But SNPVAC said Ryanair had refused to comply with a protocol signed last November, which it said included holiday pay, 22 days of annual leave per year and full compliance with Portuguese parental law.
At the height of the busy summer season, Portugal's government set out a minimum service for Ryanair and its staff to deliver, including a daily round trip between Lisbon and London.
SNPVAC said the minimum service order was ""abusive"", arguing it undermined the right to strike.
Belgium's CNE and ACV PULS trade unions told members on Tuesday not to comply with a Ryanair request to staff flights affected by the Portuguese strike.
Spain's STICPLA union also sent a letter to its members, advising that they were not obliged to ""answer company calls"" if they were in their rest time, on days off or on holiday.
Unions representing cabin crew in Spain said their plans for 10 days of strikes next month still stood after more than seven hours of mediated talks with the airline ended on Tuesday without agreement."

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs (N:GS) has applied for majority control of its Chinese joint venture, the bank confirmed on Wednesday, the latest international bank to do so ahead of Chinese plans to eventually allow foreigners full control.
The bank submitted an application with the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) on Monday to take its stake in Goldman Sachs Gao Hua Securities to 51% - the maximum permitted - from its current 33% holding.
A spokesman for the bank confirmed the filing, which was first reported by Bloomberg.
Western banks' lack of control over the JVs, along with their limited contribution to revenues, have long been a source of frustration for foreign banks in China.
Management control would allow foreign banks to offer more services through their JVs and potentially leverage their global networks to win China market share, bankers have said.
Unlike most of the other joint ventures, Goldman Sachs already has day-to-day operational control of its joint venture, which offers investment banking services such as equities and bond underwriting and deal advice.
Despite that managerial control, Goldman has long made it clear it would eventually seek to take a majority stake too.
Under the new agreement submitted to regulators, the securities sales, trading and research operations that currently sit in the business of its partner, Beijing Gao Hua Securities, will be folded into the joint venture.
Beijing Gao Hua is controlled by veteran Chinese banker Fang Fenglei.
Goldman's move to go to 51% follows similar actions by many of its rivals following a relaxation of the rules in late 2017.
UBS (S:UBSG) was the first to get approval under the new rules as well as the stake it needed for control.  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS) is waiting for its stake purchase to be approved.
JPMorgan (N:JPM) and Nomura (T:8604) have approval and are working to start up joint ventures from scratch.
 Credit Suisse  (S:CSGN) is seeking approval to inject fresh capital into its JV in a move that would take it to 51%.

1571,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 21, 2019 03:26AM ET</span>",German 30-year Bund auction to test demand for sub-zero yields,"By Dhara Ranasinghe
LONDON (Reuters) - Germany's borrowing costs edged higher on Wednesday before the sale of new 30-year government bonds that could test investor demand for deeply negative bond yields.
Germany, the euro zone's benchmark bond issuer, plans to sell 2 billion euros of the new bond, with a 0% coupon.
Analysts say the 30-year bond will probably be the first issued with a negative yield. Thirty-year bonds sold in July yielded an average 0.3%.
Thirty-year bonds across major markets have tumbled this year as worries about weak growth and speculation about central bank easing drives investors into longer and longer-dated maturities to grab a few extra basis points of yield.
""The new 30-year bond being auctioned by Germany will be positioned as a test of investor demand for yields at these low levels,"" said Peter McCallum, a rate strategist at Mizuho.
""This launch may be one in which the auction is soft but the weakness is relatively short-lived. We suspect some will be looking to buy the bond but only after the supply has cheapened the sector further.""
Investors typically sell existing bonds before an auction to make way for new supply, and long-dated German bonds underperformed their shorter-dated peers in early trade.
The 30-year German bond yield rose 2.5 basis points to -0.15% (DE30YT=RR), above last week's record-low -0.31%.
Below 0%, investors are essentially paying governments to hold their debt -- a move that can be profitable if investors are willing later on to pay more for holding government debt.
In the past year, German 30-year bonds have returned over 30%, compared with returns of around 10% on 10-year Bunds. This comes as the pool of negative-yielding bonds deepens globally.
Returns on 30-year government bonds, Germany - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/12/5003/4960/DE2108.png
Tuesday's auction also takes place amid increasing clamor in Germany to ramp up spending to boost a frail economy.
""The appetite for that (30-year bond)could well determine whether the German government is minded to raise further money that way in the coming months,"" said Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets.

1572,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 21, 2019 03:23AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Alibaba postpones up to $15 billion Hong Kong listing amid protests: sources,"By Julie Zhu and Greg Roumeliotis
HONG KONG/NEW YORK (Reuters) - China's biggest e-commerce company  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd has delayed its up to $15 billion listing in Hong Kong amid growing political unrest in the Asian financial hub, two people with knowledge of the matter told Reuters.
Alibaba's Hong Kong-listing plans are being closely watched by the financial community for indications on the business environment in the Chinese-controlled territory and provides a window into Beijing's reading of the situation.
While no new timetable has been formally set, Alibaba could potentially launch the deal as early as October, still seeking to raise $10 billion-$15 billion, depending on whether political tensions had eased and market conditions became more favorable, one of the people said.
The decision to postpone the deal, initially set to launch in late August, was taken at a board meeting before Alibaba's earnings release last week, the second person said.
The delay was due to the lack of financial and political stability in Hong Kong, the people added, following more than 11 weeks of frequently violent pro-democracy demonstrations which have plunged the city into turmoil. 
Police have fired over 1,000 rounds of tear gas while more than 700 people have been arrested, followed by an unprecedented airport shutdown last week. 
Hong Kong's benchmark Hang Seng index fell to seven-month lows last week.
""It would be very unwise to launch the deal now or anytime soon,"" the first person said. ""It would certainly annoy Beijing by offering Hong Kong such a big gift given what's going on in the city,"" the source added.
Preparations for Alibaba's listing, potentially the world's biggest equity deal this year and the largest follow-on share sale in seven years, have been underway for some time. 
Earlier this year, Altaba, the Yahoo (NASDAQ:AABA) offshoot holding the company's stake in Alibaba, announced plans to sell up to its entire 11% stake - an event Alibaba would want to see completed ahead of its Hong Kong float to stabilize its U.S. trading volumes before investors need to adjust to the two prices that would be available following a Hong Kong listing.
The Altaba sale has been completed, the second person said.
Both people declined to be identified as they were not authorized to speak to media. Altaba did not immediately respond to a request for comment outside regular business hours. 
Alibaba declined to comment on its Hong Kong deal plans.
DEAL CRUCIAL FOR HK EXCHANGE
The second source, however, said Alibaba views the Hong Kong deal as a way to ""diversify its access to capital markets"", but not as core to its business. Alibaba ""does not see the postponement as a blow"", the person added. 
Meanwhile, a listing by Alibaba is a big deal for the Hong Kong stock exchange, which is lagging behind its New York rivals in the annual battle to be the leading global listings venue.
Just last month, Anheuser-Busch InBev canceled a planned up to $9.8 billion Hong Kong IPO of its Asia Pacific unit.
""It won't be too bad for investors as long as Alibaba is going to Hong Kong, sooner or later,"" said Connie Gu, a tech analyst at BOCOM International. 
The delay could in fact temporarily benefit rival Chinese tech stocks such as Tencent Holdings Ltd and Meituan Dianping if it meant investors would hold off withdrawing their capital from those companies in preparation for investing in Alibaba's Hong Kong listing, Gu added. 
The city loosened its rules last year specifically to lure overseas-listed Chinese tech giants to list closer to home.
Alibaba would be the first to test the new system. 
Asked last week whether Hong Kong's turmoil would affect Alibaba's listing, Hong Kong stock exchange CEO Charles Li avoided directly acknowledging the company's application, which is still technically confidential.

But Li added: ""I am confident that companies like that ultimately will find a home here, because this is home and I think they will come. I don't know when though.""

1573,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 21, 2019 03:21AM ET</span>",Exclusive: China's Tianjin government orders Bohai Steel restructuring start by September: sources,"By Shu Zhang and Muyu Xu
SINGAPORE/BEIJING (Reuters) - The government of the Chinese city of Tianjin, the only shareholder of bankrupt Bohai Steel Group Ltd, is demanding that Bohai's creditors and strategic investor implement a bankruptcy restructuring plan by the end of September, two creditor sources with direct knowledge of the matter said.
Bohai Steel, a former Fortune Global 500 company that was founded by the Tianjin municipal government in 2010 by merging four local steelmakers, collapsed in 2016 with more than 200 billion yuan ($28.4 billion) in unpaid debt, the biggest bankruptcy restructuring in China's history.
The company's demise followed years of over-expansion fueled by easy credit that left it heavily leveraged when steel prices plunged to record lows in 2015.
The implementation of Bohai's bankruptcy restructuring plan, which was approved by a local court in January, has been delayed over a power struggle between the Tianjin government, creditors and investors, as well as the local government's fears of losing state-owned assets and jobs, the sources said.
However, financial pressures from local banks and concerns about the city's own debt burden have created a new sense of urgency for the Tianjin government to start the Bohai Steel restructuring as soon as possible, they said.
The Tianjin government is keen to take action before the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China on Oct. 1, both sources said, a major event for China's ruling Communist Party. As a result, a timely reorganization is now considered a ""political task,"" they said.
""The government is pushing hard ... after Bohai there are even more complex cases to deal with,"" said one of the sources.
Neither the Tianjin government nor the management of Bohai Steel immediately responded to requests for comment sent by fax from Reuters.
In Tianjin, some financial institutions have turned their backs on any local companies due to multiple large-scale corporate defaults and the local government's inability to resolve debt crises involving state firms, bankers have told Reuters.
The Tianjin government's debt burden is the highest among China's provincial-level megacities and provinces, according to S&P Global Ratings, due to a regional economic slowdown as well as curbs on pollution and local government shadow financing.
RESTRUCTURING
Under the restructuring plan, Bohai Steel will be broken into two parts, steel and non-steel. Delong Steel Group (SI:DELO), a mid-sized private steel maker with annual capacity of 3 million tonnes, will buy Bohai's steel-related assets, said the sources.
Delong will pay 20 billion yuan for the transaction, equivalent to about 10% of Bohai's total unpaid debt, said the first of the two sources, another case of a smaller private steelmaker acquiring a floundering state company amid sector-wide consolidation.
A representative of Delong's media department said that the company would not accept any interviews or media requests.
The former Bohai assets of Tianjin Iron and Steel, Tianjin Metallurgy Group and Tianjin Tiantie Metallurgy will be combined and renamed New Tianjin Steel and hold production capacity of 14 million tonnes, said the first source.
The steel unit's remaining bank debt will likely be converted into equity, said the second source, calling the deal a ""total bargain"" for Delong.
""Creditors will make a huge loss in this case. But we've got no other choices,"" said the first source.
Since debt-to-equity swaps were re-launched by China in 2016 as a way to reduce corporate financial leverage, they have become a popular tool for banks to deal with state firms' debt burdens in government-organized bailouts.
While the steel sector used to be dominated by state players with strong government support, private firms that survived Beijing's campaign to eliminate polluting and inefficient steel capacity are expanding quickly.
The Bohai deal will make Delong the 10th largest steel producer by annual production capacity in China, the world's largest steel producing country."

1576,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 21, 2019 01:18AM ET</span>","Exclusive: Philips, under investigation in U.S. and Brazil, fired whistleblower who warned of graft","By Brad Brooks
SAO PAULO, August 21 (Reuters) - Healthcare giant Philips was warned of suspicious sales of its medical equipment to the Brazilian government, and failed to halt them, nearly a decade before an alleged bribery racket was exposed in the company's Brazil operations last year, Reuters has learned.
Claims of malfeasance reached the highest levels of the Dutch conglomerate as early as 2010, according to court records filed by federal prosecutors, internal company documents and Reuters interviews with a former manager at a Philips subsidiary in Brazil who says he told superiors of the suspected scheme and was later sacked.
That ex-employee, Jose Israel Masiero Filho, a former supply-chain executive with Dixtal Biomedica Industria e Comercio Ltda., spoke extensively with Reuters in his first interview with foreign media. He said in January 2010 he spotted irregularities in three deals to sell Philips and Dixtal equipment to an obscure Brazilian middleman who had landed big contracts with Brazil's Ministry of Health. Masiero said he suspected payoffs had been used to secure that government business, allegations now at the heart of a burgeoning graft probe in Brazil, court records show.
Masiero emailed an internal Philips hotline immediately to report his suspicions, met soon after with the company's top compliance officer, and alerted at least three other senior executives during 2010. Among them was Steve Rusckowski, former chief executive of Philips Healthcare, the company's largest division. Masiero's warnings were detailed in emails, internal company memos and court records viewed by Reuters.
""Philips should consider that by approving and accepting these sales, it will be involved in illegal activities if discovered,"" Masiero wrote to Rusckowski in an email dated October 14, 2010.
Still, Koninklijke Philips (AS:PHG), as the company is formally known, continued to sell to the Brazilian intermediary to fulfill the Health Ministry contracts, invoices show.
Rusckowski, who served as Philips Healthcare's chief executive until April 2012, did not respond to requests for comment. He is now CEO of New Jersey-based Quest Diagnostics (N:DGX).
In an emailed statement to Reuters, Philips said it is cooperating with Brazilian authorities investigating the nation's medical device industry. The company said it launched an internal investigation in 2010 in response to an ""anonymous complaint"" but ""did not identify direct evidence of wrongdoing."" The company said it did, however, tighten up its internal control processes in Brazil.
Philips would not discuss ex-employee Masiero or the circumstances surrounding his dismissal.
Brazil's Health Ministry did not respond to requests for comment.
HEALTHCARE IN THE CROSSHAIRS
Philips is now among the targets in a widening investigation into medical contracting graft in Brazil that authorities say is still in its early stages, and which has sparked additional probes by U.S. law enforcement.
Masiero is cooperating with Brazilian prosecutors. They allege Philips and other multinationals conspired with intermediaries to pay bribes for public contracts, charging Brazil's state healthcare system inflated prices to recoup the cost of the kickbacks. Twenty four people were charged last year in connection with the alleged scheme. All are currently on trial in Rio de Janeiro. 
Germany's  Siemens  AG (DE:SIEGn) and the American firms Johnson & Johnson (N:JNJ),  General Electric  Co (N:GE) and  Stryker  Corp (N:SYK), all major manufacturers of medical devices, have been swept up in the probe.
Johnson & Johnson, Siemens and GE declined to comment. They previously denied wrongdoing and said they were cooperating with the investigation. Stryker said it was committed to working in an ethical manner and that it was unable to comment further.
In the United States, the FBI, Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission have launched their own investigations into suspected corruption in sales of medical equipment in Brazil as well as China, according to people with knowledge of the matter.
The whistleblower Masiero said he is cooperating with all those agencies, an assertion confirmed in emails viewed by Reuters. The Justice Department, SEC and FBI all declined to comment.
Philips told Reuters it is ""reviewing"" inquiries from the Justice Department and SEC in connection with the Brazil probe.
MYSTERIOUS MIDDLEMAN
Now 52, Masiero was hired in 2006 to be Dixtal's exports manager, rising to become the top logistics and supply chain executive for the Sao Paulo-based medical device firm in early 2009. Philips purchased Dixtal in 2008.
In early 2010, Masiero noticed what he considered irregularities with three large contracts awarded by Brazil's Health Ministry. The deals, one for 750 Philips heart defibrillators, the others for a total of 3,972 Dixtal vital-signs monitors, were worth a combined 68.9 million reis (about $40 million at the time), government records show.
Masiero said he found it odd that Philips did not compete directly for such a major piece of business. Neither Philips or Dixtal submitted bids, according to government records of tender competitors viewed by Reuters.
Instead the contracts were won by Rizzi Comercio e Representacoes Ltda., a little-known Brazilian medical supply firm. Masiero, tasked with getting the equipment to Rizzi Comercio, was surprised to find its billing address was a tiny storefront with peeling purple paint in a dilapidated Sao Paulo neighborhood.
""It was an immediate red flag for me,"" Masiero told Reuters. 
In addition, the Health Ministry was paying well above market prices for the equipment, Masiero said, unusual for a large customer with buying clout. On February 12, 2010, for example, Masiero allegedly received an email from a Philips' sales executive, Frederik Knudsen, directing him to deliver the first shipment of 60 defibrillators to Rizzi Comercio, which marked up those devices an additional 67%, according to correspondence included in court records.
""The value that should be on the order is what was agreed to with the Health Ministry"" – $16,700 per unit – ""and not what we sold them to Rizzi for ($9,991),"" according to the email allegedly from Knudsen, which was seen by Reuters.
Prosecutors say Philips and Rizzi Comercio conspired to disguise and recoup the cost of bribes through inflated prices, fleecing Brazilian taxpayers in the process.
Knudsen, whom Philips confirmed still works for them, is now among those on trial in Rio. So is Daurio Speranzini, who led Philips Healthcare's operations in Latin America for seven years before joining GE in 2011. He left that firm last December. Both men were charged last August with racketeering and fraud.
Knudsen's lawyers did not respond to requests for comment. In a written defense filed with the court, they said Knudsen did not set Philips' prices and that he is innocent. In a separate court filing, they also questioned the veracity of the emails their client allegedly sent to Masiero.
Speranzini's lawyers referred questions to their written defense, which contends he had no knowledge of the alleged bribery scheme or of Masiero's warnings.
Also on trial for racketeering and fraud are two brothers who own Rizzi Comercio, Wlademir and Adalberto Rizzi.
Their lawyer, who did not respond to requests for comment, said in court filings that her clients engaged in no illegal activities.
SOUNDING THE ALARM
Uneasy about the deals with Rizzi Comercio, Masiero on January 20, 2010, notified Philips' global compliance team in Amsterdam through an email hotline.
Philips sent Caroline Visser, then-chief of Philips' global compliance, to Brazil to meet with Masiero in March 2010. She promised a swift investigation, according to emails the pair exchanged.
Two months later, Masiero was transferred from Dixtal to a logistics post within Philips in Sao Paulo, a move he considered a demotion and an effort to silence him. The shipments continued, invoices show.
Frustrated, Masiero on October 14, 2010, sent an email to Rusckowski, the head of Philips' healthcare division.
Masiero expressed concern about Rizzi Comercio and its use of an unfamiliar intermediary, Moses Trading American, to purchase the U.S.-made Philips heart defibrillators on its behalf for export to Brazil. Far more typical, Masiero told Reuters, would be for Philips to sell directly to Rizzi.
Masiero's uneasiness only increased when he traced Moses Trading American's address on Philips' invoices to a private home on a golf course in suburban Phoenix.
""Moses Trading selling operation is clearly suspicious,"" Masiero wrote to Rusckowski.
According to emails reviewed by Reuters, Rusckowski forwarded Masiero's message to Clement Revetti, Jr., the chief legal officer for Philips Healthcare. Revetti thanked Masiero and asked him not to contact the CEO again.
Masiero defied that order. On November 9, 2010, he again emailed Rusckowski and Revetti of his concerns.
On March 4, 2011, Masiero says he discussed his suspicions once more in person in Sao Paulo with Visser, the compliance head. He was fired later that day. Masiero said he was given no reason for his dismissal. Paperwork required under Brazilian labor laws shows Philips sacked Masiero ""without cause,"" meaning the company made no claims that it was performance-related.
Visser and Revetti did not respond to requests for comment.
As for Moses Trading American, Brazilian prosecutors say that operation is run by a Peruvian named Oscar Moses whom they are investigating in connection with a string of allegedly fraudulent medical equipment deals in Brazil. He has not been charged with a crime.
Moses did not respond to requests to comment sent to his LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) profiles. 
TALKING TO PROSECUTORS
Discouraged after his firing, Masiero dropped the matter.
Then in 2014, Brazil was engulfed by a corruption scandal centered on contracting graft at state oil company Petrobras (SA:PETR4). That blockbuster probe, known as Car Wash, ultimately toppled leaders at the highest levels of Brazilian business and politics.
Masiero got in touch with federal prosecutors.
""His information was key to helping us break up this scheme,"" said Marisa Ferrari (NYSE:RACE), a lead prosecutor on the case.
Masiero, meanwhile, is unemployed. He said he has been blacklisted in Brazil.
He and his family recently left Brazil for a country Masiero does not want to name.

TALLINN (Reuters) - Estonia's Bolt, a popular ride-sharing service in Eastern Europe and Africa, on Wednesday launched food delivery service in its home town of Tallinn, the nation's capital, and said it plans to roll out Bolt Food this year in South Africa, Latvia and Lithuania as well.
Bolt, which until early this year was called Taxify, has grabbed business from Uber (NYSE:UBER) mostly in major African cities and Eastern Europe. It now operates in 30 countries.
Bolt is a late entrant to the food delivery market, where a number of start-ups and other ride-sharing firms have operated for years. It plans to grab market share with lower prices for consumers and a better cut for delivery personnel, while building on its wide user base.
""This is a very competitive market,"" Jevgeni Kabanov, chief product officer at Bolt, told Reuters in an interview. ""However, we have more than 25 million people around the world using Bolt and food delivery has been a popular request for quite some time.""
Bolt rebranded earlier in 2019 to ensure the ride-hailing service is not confused with taxis and to represent its widening offering - it has launched scooter rentals in selected cities.
""I would say food delivery is the third big product launch for us. It fits very neatly into our strategy,"" Kabanov said.
In the first half of 2019, Uber said revenue from its Uber Eats almost doubled from a year earlier to $1.1 billion. But the sector has proved challenging for a number of start-ups as investment has declined from a peak in 2015.
Venture capitalists have in general pulled back from the sector amid concern over excessive competition and high valuations for companies that generally are not profitable.
In Tallinn, Bolt Food's main rival will be Helsinki-based food delivery service Wolt, which has raised $160 million since the beginning of 2018.
Bolt, founded in 2013, has raised more than $200 million from investors, including Daimler and China's Didi Chuxing Technology Co, among others."
1578,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 20, 2019 11:55PM ET</span>",Negative-Yield Debt in Japan Hasn't Looked This Good Since 2008,"(Bloomberg) -- Japan’s negative-yielding bonds were a surprise beneficiary of the collapse in global rates in July.
Foreign investors more than doubled purchases of the nation’s debt last month to 2.88 trillion yen ($27.1 billion) from 1.28 trillion yen in June, according to data from Japan Securities Dealers Association. The bulk of purchases were in the two-to-five-year bracket, where the extra yield that can be gained over Treasuries using currency forwards swelled to the highest in a decade.
Global funds also bought more super-long bonds -- those due in 20 years or more -- amid speculation the worsening outlook for global growth will spur the Bank of Japan to ease policy, a move that would disproportionately favor longer maturities.
The large purchases of two-to-five-year bonds by overseas investors imply they were relatively active on cross-currency transactions as yields fell in the rest of the world, said Keiko Onogi, senior JGB strategist at Daiwa Securities Co. in Tokyo. The buying of longer-maturity debt suggests they were topping up duration risk given growing concerns about the global slowdown, she said.
While all Japanese bonds with maturities up to 15 years are yielding less than zero, using currency forwards to structure the investment can more than compensate for that.
Investors who lend dollars for yen using three-month forwards can earn an annualized return of 2.49%. Taking the yen proceeds and plugging them into five-year JGBs gives a total return of 2.15%. That’s a 70 basis-point pick-up over five-year Treasuries, the most since 2008.
While foreign funds boosted overall holdings of Japanese bonds last month, local investors were net sellers of the two-to-five-year sector. Major domestic banks offloaded 241.6 billion of those maturities, while trust banks cut holdings by 204 billion yen.
Foreign investors have been net buyers of Japan’s super-long bonds for all but one month this year amid intensifying speculation the central bank will respond to the global-growth slowdown by boosting stimulus.  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS),  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). and JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co. have all recommended investors buy the nation’s longer-dated debt in recent weeks."

Down under, Australia’s ASX 200 dropped 1.0%.
Concerns about a global economic slowdown continued to be cited as headwinds for the markets today.
Traders also remained cautious amid conflicting signs on the Sino-U.S. trade front. U.S. President Donald Trump said he had to “take China on” even if it would cause short-term impact on U.S. economy.
""Somebody had to take China on,"" Trump told reporters during a White House visit by Romanian President Klaus Iohannis. ""This is something that had to be done. The only difference is I am doing it,"" he said.
""China has been ripping this country off for 25 years, for longer than that and it's about time whether it's good for our country or bad for our country short term. Long term it's imperative that somebody does this,"" he said.
Meanwhile, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said at a private lunch on Tuesday that he beliveves the trade war with China could end by the end of 2020, according to CNBC who cited people who attended the gathering.
Tensions between the two sides seemingly eased somewhat on Tuesday after the U.S. extended a license that allows tech giant Huawei to continue doing business with U.S. companies.
Monetary policy will dictate movements in the stock markets in the coming days, as the U.S. Federal Reserve releases the minutes of its July meeting later in the day while Fed Chairman Jerome Powell is expected to give a speech on Friday.
Analysts currently expect the central bank to cut rates at its meeting next month. Trump previously said the Fed should cut interest rates by at least 100 basis points and add “some” quantitative easing for good measure."

The United States Postal Service contracted with American to take possession of receptacles of U.S. mail at six locations and then deliver it to numerous international and domestic destinations. The settlement resolves claims American Airlines falsely reported the times it transferred possession of the mail. American did not immediately comment Tuesday.
""We expect companies doing business with the government to comply with their contractual obligations,” said Assistant Attorney General Jody Hunt, who heads the department's civil division. ""The Department of Justice vigorously pursues all manner of fraudulent conduct that undermines the benefits that the government has bargained for.""
American said in a statement it was pleased it had reached a settlement.
""The allegations focused on conduct that was remedied years ago, and we have invested in new equipment and procedures to ensure that we are in full compliance with our commitments,"" the statement said. It added that ""the U.S. Postal Service is an important customer for American, and we are glad to have corrected these procedures and put this matter behind us.""
American said in a securities filing the Justice Department in April 2015 notified the airline it was investigating American’s 2009 and 2011 contracts with the U.S. Postal Service for the international transportation of mail by air.
The contract required American to take possession of mail at U.S. locations or at various Department of Defense and State Department locations abroad, and then deliver that mail to numerous international and domestic destinations.
""To obtain payment under the contracts, American Airlines was required to submit electronic scans of the mail receptacles to USPS reporting the time the mail was delivered at the specified destinations. The contracts specified penalties for mail that was delivered late or to the wrong location,"" the Justice Department said.

1581,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 20, 2019 09:40PM ET</span>",Walmart sues Tesla for negligence after repeated solar system fires,"By Nichola Groom and Nivedita Balu
(Reuters) - Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc on Tuesday sued Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc, accusing it of ""widespread negligence"" that led to repeated fires of its solar systems and asking a court to force Tesla to remove solar panels from more than 240 of its U.S. stores.
Solar energy systems installed and maintained by the electric car maker were responsible for fires at seven locations, with dozens showing hazardous problems such as loose wiring and ""hot spots"" on panels, according to court papers filed in New York State Supreme Court.
Tesla did not respond to a request for comment.
The lawsuit accuses Tesla of having untrained workers putting up shoddy installations and showing ""utter incompetence or callousness, or both,"" court papers said.
The lawsuit is the latest blow to Tesla's struggling solar business, which it acquired through its $2.6 billion purchase of SolarCity in 2016. Quarterly installations have plummeted more than 85 percent since the deal, as Tesla has cut its solar panel sales force and ended a distribution deal with  Home Depot  Inc (NYSE:HD) . 
The fires destroyed significant amounts of store merchandise and required substantial repairs, totaling millions of dollars in losses, Walmart said in the lawsuit. 
In addition, inspections of the retailer's other Tesla-owned solar installations ""displayed troubling problems that were indicative of widespread negligence,"" the lawsuit said.
As of November 2018, at least seven Walmart stores, including in Denton, Maryland and Beavercreek, Ohio, had experienced fires due to Tesla's solar systems, according to the lawsuit. One of the fires happened months after the system was de-energized, Walmart said.
The suit argues that inadequate inspections by Tesla have created a safety hazard for Walmart customers and employees.
'MONEY PRINTER ON YOUR ROOF'
Walmart became a SolarCity customer in 2010 and over the next six years fitted 244 of its store rooftops with panels in a bid to improve its image as an environmentally aware company and to lower its energy costs. In the lawsuit, it asks for the court to require Tesla to remove all of its systems from Walmart stores, which are now all de-energized. 
Walmart has a goal of sourcing 35 percent of its electricity from renewables by 2020. The retailer was a major customer for SolarCity, which added both residential and commercial installations at a rapid clip while taking on significant debt.
In the lawsuit, Walmart accused SolarCity of having ""an ill-considered business model that required it to install solar panel systems haphazardly and as quickly as possible in order to turn a profit, and the contractors and subcontractors who performed the original installation work had not been properly hired, trained, and supervised.""
Under the terms of its solar energy contracts, SolarCity, and then Tesla, was required to install, maintain and operate the panel systems, according to the lawsuit.
In July, Walmart gave Tesla 30 days to provide analyses of the root causes of the fires, compensate the retailer for damages to its stores and demonstrate an overhaul of its operations, among other measures. As of Aug. 15, Tesla ""still had not taken any reasonable steps toward curing its breaches,"" the lawsuit said.
Three days later, on Aug. 18, Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk announced the re-launch of the company's solar business that allows customers to install solar panels without a long-term contract.
""It's like having a money printer on your roof,"" Musk wrote on Twitter.
Shares of the California-based company lost about 1.65% in extended trading.

The case is Walmart Inc vs Tesla Energy Operations, New York State Supreme Court, New York County.

1582,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 20, 2019 09:39PM ET</span>",'You prepare for war': how one U.S. firm tried escaping Trump's China tariffs,"By Anne Marie Roantree
HONG KONG (Reuters) - When Larry Sloven heard last year that U.S. tariffs threatened his China electronics business, he knew that setting up shop elsewhere would be a slog rather than an adventure.
The 70-year-old had spent half his life building supply chains in southern China to produce goods for big-box U.S. retailers. But he had never reshuffled one on short notice, with tariffs hanging over his head. 
""It is the hardest thing I've ever had to do in all my 30 years in the business,"" said Sloven, president of Capstone International HK Ltd, a division of Florida-based Capstone Companies.
""You've got packaging, assembling, auditing, labor, overheads, components, logistics, transportation,"" he said. ""I went from first gear to fourth gear very quickly."" 
Sloven, a native of Long Island, New York, cut his teeth in Asia in the 1970s sourcing lighting products from Japan. He then moved to Taiwan and then mainland China, making and sourcing electrical products for AT&T (NYSE:T) and Duracell, before becoming a buying agent for sporting goods retailer Dick's.
He joined Capstone in 2012 to manage its network of Chinese manufacturers from Hong Kong. 
Rising labor costs and tighter regulations in China had already led him to consider moving the business elsewhere in Asia. But the trade war forced his hand. 
Through dozens of interviews and phone, Whatsapp and email exchanges over a year, Reuters documented Sloven's quest to uproot his supply chain operation, an effort entailing many close calls, bureaucratic headaches - and some good luck.
Sloven is just one of thousands of entrepreneurs who have been forced by the trade war to upend their business operations in China in the biggest supply chain shift in a generation.
Companies like Capstone contribute over $200 billion in U.S. purchases of China-made electronics and machinery annually. 
GRAPHIC: China's top exports and imports from U.S. - https://tmsnrt.rs/2KVYxbp
DUE DILIGENCE
When Washington imposed the first tariffs in July 2018, Capstone's core products, such as battery-powered LED bulbs and motion-activated lighting, were not on the list.
Nor were some Capstone prototypes that Sloven sees as the future of the company: ""smart furniture"" like a mirror that doubles as a touchscreen with internet access.
But his instinct was that U.S.-China ties were taking a turn for the worse.
""You don't know what's coming next in China,"" he said.
He set his sights on Thailand as the site of a possible second production base. Sourcing raw materials locally was difficult, but at least they carried no import duties. Setting up a business entity in Thailand was also cheap and fast, and some of the work could be subcontracted. 
A U.S. trade official in Thailand introduced him to various local companies who could help.
""I will be able to make products in Thailand,"" Sloven said at the end of last summer. But, he added, ""it's not going to be easy.""
In September, U.S. President Donald Trump gave him an even better reason to move.
The total value of U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods was expanded from $50 billion to $250 billion, putting Capstone's LED products in the crosshairs of 10% levies.
Smart furniture, if made in China, would take a hit.
Soon after, a survey by Amcham China, which represents U.S. businesses, showed that a third of its members were planning to shift the sourcing of components or assemble some goods outside of China.
Sloven's efforts in Thailand appeared to have paid off. After numerous meetings, he found a furniture factory and an assembler outside Bangkok that could help him.
Both had international experience and were expanding to meet increasing demand from U.S. firms. And while smart furniture was new to them, they were confident they could pull it off and were ready to invest. The companies cannot be named because of non-disclosure agreements.
After a site visit in February, Sloven ordered components for his smart mirror to be shipped to Thailand. By mid-March, Capstone engineers were showing the factory how to put them together.
""I'm not concerned,"" Sloven said in February. ""I'm giving him the information step by step,"" he said, referring to his Thai partner. 
Even as Sloven grew more optimistic, the urgency to leave China seemed to abate as 2019 began. 
Trump and President Xi Jinping of China had declared a cautious truce at a Group of 20 summit in Buenos Aires, and it seemed to be holding. Officials on both sides were suggesting a deal before a March deadline, and the threat of tariffs rising to 25% seemed distant.
But Sloven was sticking to his plan.
""I don't think there's going to be a trade war, but that doesn't change things,"" he said at the time.
GRAPHIC: SE Asia factory activity holds up better - https://tmsnrt.rs/2HhYaaf
MOVING SLOWLY
The March deadline passed, but tariffs remained unchanged. That gave Sloven breathing room.
He scheduled a series of pilot runs to test how well the Thai factory handled assembly. He also needed to prepare for audits of labor rights and environmental standards that U.S. retailers require.
He estimated that would take at least another six months. 
""I'm going to start moving on a small scale because they're not going to be able to just do it immediately,"" Sloven said. ""As much as they say, 'Oh, I can do this right now' - I'm not taking that chance."" 
More investment in tooling and moulds was required, too, but the Thai companies agreed to bear the cost.
Regardless of what happened with the trade war, Sloven felt covered.
""You prepare for war,"" he said. ""You're ready if you're attacked.""
RE-NEGOTIATING CHINA
Sloven also had work to do in China. 
His suppliers in Shenzhen, Dongguan and Guangzhou were certain the trade conflict would blow over and were reluctant to negotiate deals that would send components and raw materials abroad for assembly.
But Sloven kept pressing ahead with the Thailand plan, concerned about the toll the trade war was taking in China.
In early April, Sloven invited Reuters to meet his trade lawyer, Sally Peng of Sandler, Travis & Rosenberg.
Peng described how Chinese factory floors were emptying out as workers were laid off. Few owners had the expertise or resources to automate or find new export markets, so most were riding it out, hoping for a trade deal. They were ""losing money every day,"" she said.
""They believe that eventually it will all come back,"" Sloven said. 
""I think within five years, it will all be gone,"" Peng replied.
GRAPHIC: Trade flows redirected away from China - https://tmsnrt.rs/2P6b2qb
INVESTOR CALL
The same day Sloven met his lawyer, his bosses in Florida announced 2018 results that reflected the effects of the trade war. Net revenues came in at $12.8 million, down from $36.8 million in 2017. Net losses were $1 million, a swing from a $3.1 million profit. 
""Capstone faced challenges in 2018 unlike any in its history,"" chief financial officer Gerry McClinton said.
Meanwhile, development of the smart mirror was in full swing. The prototype was deemed a success at a Las Vegas electronics show in January, and a PR agency and a marketing company were hired to advertise the new product.
Then Trump hiked tariffs to 25% on May 10.
For Sloven - and many others - the urgency level bounced back up. That month, a survey by AmCham China and AmCham Shanghai showed the number of firms that had moved production or were considering doing so leaped above 40%.
To speed things up, Sloven introduced the Thai assemblers to his Chinese suppliers. 
He wanted to set the rules of the game and then let them interact independently. Those meetings had to go well, or all could fall apart.
In a stroke of luck, he discovered the two sides had something in common.
""The Thai guy, his family was from China originally so he spoke a certain dialect. And the factory in China – my supplier - and him speak the same dialect,"" Sloven said. ""What a home run!""
After months of digging in its heels, the Chinese company finally relented and agreed to supply Sloven in Thailand.
AUDITS, LOGISTICS
With his supply of components and raw materials secured, the next big step was the audits. 
Thirty-five percent of the product had to be made in Thailand for the product to be considered Thai, and thus exempt from American tariffs.
A certificate from an independent auditor would prove that, but the auditing usually takes four to five weeks.
""I know what I have to do, but getting the information is mind-boggling. These are supply chain issues that everyone in the world is going to have to face,"" Sloven said. 
Logistics was another concern for Sloven. Shipping to the United States from Thailand takes 8-10 days longer than it does from China.
Despite the extra costs and time, Sloven thinks he will be able to make the product for the same price as in China without the tariffs.
And by the middle of the summer of 2019, Sloven was confident that most of his challenges had been overcome and that the smart mirror would ship on schedule on October 1. 

But, he allowed, ""there's always going to be hiccups"".

1584,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 20, 2019 06:27PM ET</span>",U.S. Justice Department teams up with states on probe of Big Tech firms,"By Katie Paul and David Shepardson
ASPEN, Colo./WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department is working with a group of more than a dozen state attorneys general as it moves forward with a broad investigation into major technology companies, the department's antitrust chief, Makan Delrahim, said on Tuesday.
Delrahim said at a tech conference in Colorado the government is looking at previously approved acquisitions as part of a broad antitrust review announced in July of major tech firms with significant market power.
""Those are some of the questions that are being raised ... whether those were nascent competitors that may or may not have been wise to approve,"" Delrahim said. ""Whether the intention of the incumbent was to purchase some of those competitors, I don’t know. I’m not privy to the facts of each of those investigations.""
On July 23, the Justice Department said it was opening a broad investigation into whether major digital technology firms engaged in anticompetitive practices, including concerns raised about ""search, social media, and some retail services online.""
That was an apparent reference to Alphabet Inc's (O:GOOGL) Google, Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) and  Facebook Inc  (O:FB), and potentially Apple Inc (O:AAPL).
More than a dozen states are expected to announce in the coming weeks they are launching a formal probe, a person briefed on the matter told Reuters.
""I think it’s safe to say more than a dozen or so state attorneys general that have expressed an interest in the subject matter,"" Delrahim said.
U.S. Representative David Cicilline, a Democrat who chairs a House panel that oversees antitrust issues, said on Tuesday, ""Big tech platforms aren’t going to regulate themselves. I’m pleased that several state attorneys general are now conducting their own investigation into the dominance of these firms.""
In July, eight state attorneys general met with U.S. Attorney General William Barr to discuss the effect of big tech companies on competition, and various antitrust actions.
The New York Attorney General's office said on Monday it is continuing to ""engage in bipartisan conversations about the unchecked power of large tech companies."" North Carolina's attorney general, Josh Stein, is also ""participating in bipartisan conversations about this issue,"" his office said.
The department is looking not only at price effects, but also innovation and quality, and the next steps in its broad antitrust review would be seeking documents and other information and could include some compulsory requests, Delrahim said.
After the July announcement the companies under investigation ""immediately reached out to work with us in a cooperative manner to provide information that we need as far as the investigation,"" Delrahim added.
The Federal Trade Commission in June told Facebook it had opened an antitrust investigation. Last month, the FTC resolved a separate privacy probe into Facebook's practices after the company agreed to pay a $5 billion penalty."
1585,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 20, 2019 05:42PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch,"Investing.com - Here's a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow.
1. Fed Minutes, Housing Activity in Focus
Monetary policy comes into focus tomorrow as the Federal Reserve releases the minutes of its July meeting at 2 PM ET (18:00 GMT).
With expectations running high that the U.S. central bank is likely to cut rates at its meeting next month, the minutes will likely be parsed for further insight into policymakers’ appetite to support easier monetary policy measures, specifically if there was much dissent among the FOMC members.
President Donald Trump earlier this week continued to call on the Fed to cut rates.
Trump said the central bank should cut interest rates by at least 100 basis points and throw in “some” quantitative easing for good measure.
The National Association of Realtors releases its report on July existing home sales at 10 AM ET (14:00 GMT).
Forecasts compiled by Investing.com expect the report to show existing home sales in July rose 2.5% from June to 5.39 million units on an annualized basis. 
2. Crude Inventories on Tap
The Energy Information Administration (EIA) releases its weekly petroleum report Wednesday morning. 
Ahead of the EIA report, the American Petroleum Institute released data, which often serves as an early indication of weekly petroleum levels, showing crude stockpiles fell by 3.5 million barrels last week.
The EIA is expected to report crude stockpiles fell by 1.889 million barrels last week. The report has confounded economists’ estimates lately, showing a build for two consecutive weeks against expectations for a decline.
Crude oil futures rose 0.2% to settle at $56.34 a barrel.
3. Lowe's, Target Earnings Due
Earnings from Lowe’s Companies (NYSE:LOW) are due before the opening bell Wednesday, coming a day after rival   Home Depot   (NYSE:HD) topped forecasts but cut its outlook amid pressures from falling lumber prices. 
Lowe's is expected to report earnings of $2.01 a share on revenue of $20.95 billion. 
The home-improvement retailer’s results are expected to reflect an uptick in costs amid restricting efforts. It announced store closures and job cuts last year as part of a major restructuring plan. 
In its first-quarter report, the home-improvement retailer cut its full-year earnings outlook, and investors will be keen for an update following the key spring quarter.
Lowe's shares are up 6.2% this year.
  Target   (NYSE:TGT), meanwhile, is expected to report earnings of $1.62 a share and revenue of $18.3 billion before the opening bell on Wednesday. 
As well as earnings and guidance, commentary concerning the Trump administration’s decision to delay tariffs on retail-sensitive items such as toys and clothes to Dec. 15 from Sept. 1 will likely draw close attention. 
The tariff delay eased fears that U.S. companies would be forced to pass any additional levies on certain items to consumers during the key holiday season.
 Target  (NYSE:TGT) shares are up 29% this year."
1586,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 20, 2019 05:39PM ET</span>",Stocks - S&P Pulls Back After Three Days of Wins,"Investing.com - After three days that produced big gains, stocks pulled back on Tuesday.
The S&P 500 fell 0.8%. The Dow dropped 0.7% and the Nasdaq Composite slid 0.7%.
The easy explanation - also a likely one - is that investors decided to cash in recent gains to see what will happen next. The risks to the market haven't gone away, and investors showed their concerns with a wave of selling in the last 15 minutes of trading.
In addition, interest rates moved lower, a signal of demand for lower-risk assets. The 10-Year Treasury yield fell to 1.552% from Monday's 1.598%. The 10-2 Year Treasury Yield Spread narrowed to 4.32 basis points from Monday's 5.58 basis points.
The spread actually went negative last week, seen by many investors as a signal a recession might be ahead. That caused markets to slump badly on Wednesday, with the Dow off 800 points. President Donald Trump suggested the administration might cut rates on payroll taxes to support the economy.
While the president has insisted the economy is strong, he also called on the Federal Reserve to cut its key interest rate by 100 basis points. The Fed cut its federal fund rates by a quarter point on July 31. Minutes from that Fed Meeting will be released Wednesday afternoon and will offer a look at how the central bank views the economy.
The Fed is expected to vote for another rate cut at its Sept. 18 meeting.
With Tuesday's selling, the major averages remain 4% or more below their peaks reached in July. The S&P 500 is off 4.2% from its July high. The Dow is down 5.2%
The Nasdaq is off 4.7%, with the Nasdaq 100 index down 4.52%. The Nasdaq 100 was off 0.71% on the day.
An additional factor that probably came into play -- many investors and money managers go on vacation in the last two weeks of August, which reduces trading volumes and can boost volatility.
“For some time, we have been concerned that investors were too reliant on Fed rate cuts and too complacent about the prospects for a China trade deal, and we are now seeing the market waking up to these risks,"" wrote David Spika, president of GuideStone Capital Management, in a Tuesday note. ""There is way too much uncertainty to be near-term bullish today,""
Tech shares were held back (with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) an exception) by a Wall Street Journal report that as many as 20 states attorneys general will launch a joint antitrust investigation of large technology companies.
Apple's gain was tiny, just 1 cent to $210.36. It was one of 24 Nasdaq 100 stocks that were higher Tuesday and one of just three Dow stocks to see gains on the day.
The Dow was led by   Home Depot   (NYSE:HD), whose earnings beat analysts' estimates. Shares were up 4.4% as a result. But the company injected some notes of worry. Lumber prices were lower, the company warned, and it's worried about the impact of higher tariffs on many home-improvement products. 
The third Dow winner was United Technologies (NYSE:UTX), up just 3 cents. 
 
 
 
Oil prices were basically flat, with West Texas Intermediate crude down a penny at $56.13. Brent crude added 29 cents to $60.03 a barrel.
U.S. energy stocks, particularly oil-and-gas production and oil services companies, struggled.
Retail stocks were hit, particularly Macy’s (NYSE:M) and Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN). Nordstrom reports fiscal-second-quarter earnings after Wednesday's close. Macy's quarterly results last week were badly received, with shares falling 10% in a day. Nordstrom shares are down 45% this year and 20% since June 28. 
Adding to the unease in U.S. markets were worries about slow growth in Europe and a growing political crisis in Italy after its prime minister resigned.
Winners and Losers in the S&P 500 
 Home Depot  (NYSE:HD), defense contractor Raytheon (NYSE:RTN), home-improvement retailer Lowe’s Companies (NYSE:LOW) and medical-equipment company   Medtronic   (NYSE:MDT) were among the top S&P 500 performers. 
Discount retailer Kohl's (NYSE:KSS), chemical-maker Dow Inc. (NYSE:DOW), Macy’s (NYSE:M) and food processor ConAgra Foods (NYSE:CAG) were among the worst S&P 500 performers. "
1587,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 20, 2019 05:37PM ET</span>",China Is Cracking Down on Inflated Bond Trading Numbers,"(Bloomberg) -- China is cracking down on banks and brokers that it suspects of inflating bond trading volumes in an effort to win more business, according to traders familiar with the matter.
A subsidiary of the central bank is monitoring large transactions on the X-Bond system for signs of abnormal trading, the two traders said, asking not to be named as they’re not authorized to speak to media. The checks started after turnover on a China Development Bank note spiked to a record on July 16, according to the people. Daily volume on that contract has fallen by a third since.
China Foreign Exchange Trade System, an interbank trading platform affiliated with the central bank, didn’t immediately reply to a fax requesting comment.
Market participants interpret some of the activity by China’s smaller banks and securities firms as taking place for the purpose of increasing turnover rather than servicing clients, the traders said. The appearance of liquidity helps them rank highly on government-compiled list of the most active market players, attracting more business. Authorities last year acted to stop the practice in the onshore currency market, after transaction volume on the yuan surged to a record.
The practice doesn’t move yields as neither party places strong bets on direction -- instead the trades are matched or offset to boost transaction volume. China is pushing to modernize its bond market to attract greater capital inflows, as the yuan weakens amid an escalating trade war with the U.S. A sudden spike in turnover can confuse foreign investors already grappling with obstacles such as a volatile currency or a lack of hedging tools.
The daily turnover on the 10-year China Development Bank notes that alerted officials surged to more than 150 billion yuan ($21 billion) on July 16. The volume was 104 billion yuan on Monday, and the yield rose 1 basis point to 3.41% on Tuesday.
CFETS publishes a ranking of the most active players on the X-Bond platform every month. The platform, which was introduced three years ago and allows traders to offer quotes anonymously, accounted for 10% of onshore debt transactions in 2017.

“Donald Trump inherited a growing economy from the Obama-Biden administration just like he inherited everything in his life,” the former vice president said during an event in Prole, Iowa. “And now he’s squandering it just like everything he’s inherited.”
Biden said Trump’s “irresponsible tariff war” with China has hurt farmers and stunted growth for the entire economy.
While Trump insisted Tuesday that the U.S. is “very far from a recession,” he and his economic advisers have been casting about for ways to cut taxes to juice the economy amid signs of rising risks of a U.S. and worldwide recession.
De Blasio Says He’s Still in Race to Win (2:00 p.m.)
New York Mayor Bill de Blasio has less than 1% support in national polls, and he’s far short of the 130,000 donors needed to participate in a September debate among Democratic presidential candidates, yet he says he’s still in the race to win.
“I’m standing up for working people. I’m standing up for labor unions. I’m saying very bluntly that we can not depend on private insurance companies to give people the kind of health care they actually deserve,” de Blasio said Tuesday during an MSNBC interview.
Among New York City voters, 76% opposed his presidential candidacy in an April 3 Quinnipiac University poll, with a 42% job approval rating.
De Blasio acknowledged he probably won’t make the cut for the September debate. To qualify, candidates need 130,000 individual donations, and at least a 2% showing in four different polls. As of his last filing in July, de Blasio had raised $1.1 million from 6,700 donors. -- Hnery Goldman
Castro Is 10th Candidate to Make Third Debate (12:20 p.m.)
Julian Castro’s qualification for the third Democratic debate means there will be at least a full stage of 10 candidates for the September face-off.
The CNN/SSRS poll released Tuesday provided the former Housing and Urban Development secretary with his fourth showing he’s met the 2% minimum support to guarantee his place on the debate stage. Castro met the threshold of 130,000 unique donors -- with at least 400 from 20 or more states -- in July.
Former Vice President Joe Biden, Senators Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Kamala Harris of California, Cory Booker of New Jersey and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, South Bend, Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg, former Texas congressman Beto O’Rourke and entrepreneur Andrew Yang will also face off in Houston.The Democratic National Committee limited the stage to 10 candidates per night in the first two debates but has yet to say what it will do if another candidate makes the cut for the third round, scheduled for Sept. 12-13. Billionaire Tom Steyer has met the donor threshold and is one poll away from qualifying. Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii also has the donors but is still two polls away from making the stage.
Republican Party Raises $20.8 Million in July (10:48 a.m.)
The Republican National Committee raised $20.8 million in July, bringing its total to $117.9 million for the year as it prepares for President Donald Trump’s re-election campaign.
The RNC ended the month with $46.6 million cash on hand and no debts, it announced. It’s hired staff in 16 key states around the country and is training volunteers and registering voters. It’s also launched digital ads targeting Democrats in down ballot races.
“We continue to directly invest this money into growing our top-notch data-driven infrastructure,” said RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel.
Major donors provided 45% of the party’s fundraising, up from 33% during the mid-terms, when big contributors focus more on congressional races.
The RNC and its counterpart, the Democratic National Committee, which had raised $44 million through June, are due to file their monthly reports with the Federal Election Commission Tuesday. -- Bill Allison
Biden Regains Double-Digit Lead in New CNN Poll (6:50 A.M.)
Joe Biden’s front-runner margin has widened over his Democratic rivals for the party’s nomination in a new CNN poll released Tuesday.The former vice president gained 7 percentage points from a June poll, while Senator Kamala Harris dropped the most, losing 12 points since the surge she saw in polling after the first Democratic candidate debates.
Biden has 29% of Democratic and Democratic-leaning registered voters in the poll, trailed by Senators Bernie Sanders with 15% and Elizabeth Warren with 14%. Their support has remained relatively stable.
The biggest loser was Harris, who had 17% of support in CNN’s June poll taken in the days immediately following the first Democratic National Committee-sanctioned debates. She dropped to 5% in the poll released Tuesday. South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg also had 5%, followed by former Congressman Beto O’Rourke with 4%.
Among the rest of the field, former HUD Secretary Julián Castro scored 2%, securing his spot on the debate stage in Houston next month, as it marks his fourth such qualifying poll.
The survey was conducted for CNN by SSRS Aug. 15-18 of a random sample of 1,001 adults across the country. The margin of error for results from the subsample of 402 Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents who are registered to vote, is plus-or-minus 6.1 points. -- Elizabeth Wasserman

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said on Tuesday that it has fined and settled charges against a Russia-based ratings firm for failure to disclose payments it received to publicize digital asset offerings of issuers it had rated.
The regulator said that ICO Rating had not admitted or denied the SEC's charges but had agreed to pay a nearly $269,000 fine for the so-called ""anti-touting"" violations committed between December 2017 and July 2018.
The firm also agreed not to break those rules in the future, the SEC said.
ICO Rating did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The SEC has previously issued specific warnings about the promotion of cryptocurrency online fundraisers known as initial coin offerings (ICOs).
It is aiming to crack down on the array of 'ICO agencies' that offer crypto issuers active followers and posts on social media platforms such as Reddit and Bitcointalk. These can attract investors, given the lack of conventional financial information available on cryptocurrencies.
Some research houses accept payments in the cryptocurrencies they are analyzing and may give positive ratings for a price. Often the payments are not disclosed, a violation of securities law. Reuters reported on the phenomenon last year.
""The securities laws require promoters, including both people and entities, to disclose compensation they receive for touting investments so that potential investors are aware they are viewing a paid promotional item,"" said Melissa Hodgman, a director in the SEC's enforcement division.
""This requirement applies regardless of whether the securities being touted are issued using traditional certificates or on the blockchain."""

1593,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 20, 2019 05:11PM ET</span>","JPMorgan metals trader pleads guilty to spoofing, resigns from bank","By Jonathan Stempel
NEW YORK (Reuters) - A JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co precious metals trader pleaded guilty to spoofing, or placing bogus trade offers, on Tuesday, when he also resigned as an executive director at the bank.
The guilty plea and resignation of Christian Trunz, 34, of London, were announced by the U.S. Department of Justice.
Trunz admitted in the federal court in Brooklyn, New York, to having from July 2007 to August 2016 at JPMorgan and another bank placed thousands of orders for gold, platinum and palladium futures contracts that he never intended to complete.
While the Justice Department did not identify the banks by name in court papers, Trunz had worked for JPMorgan since at least 2008, according to the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority's BrokerCheck database.
Lawyers for Trunz did not immediately respond to requests for comment. A spokeswoman for JPMorgan declined to comment.
Trunz's plea followed a guilty plea to spoofing last October by another JPMorgan trader, John Edmonds, in a Connecticut federal court.
The Justice Department said Trunz, who worked in New York, London and Singapore, learned about spoofing from more senior traders and engaged in the practice with the consent of his immediate supervisors.
U.S. prosecutors have charged several other traders with spoofing, and their probe into the practice is continuing. JPMorgan said in a Feb. 26 regulatory filing that it was cooperating with the probe.
Trunz pleaded guilty to one count of spoofing and one count of conspiracy to engage in spoofing. His sentencing is scheduled for Feb. 19, 2020. Edmonds has yet to be sentenced.
The case is U.S. v Trunz, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of New York, No. 19-cr-00375."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Betting against  General Electric  Co (N:GE) stock has increased in the last week as the stock has fallen following a report by fraud investigator Harry Markopolos that questioned the conglomerate's accounting, financial analytics firm S3 Partners said on Tuesday.
Short sales, or bets that GE's stock price will fall, rose 13.5% to $14.3 million in the last week and 20.7% to $20.6 million in the last month, Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director of predictive analytics at New York-based S3 Partners, told Reuters.
GE stock closed down 3.3% at $8.38 on Tuesday, and is down about 7 percent since Markopolos's report came out last Thursday.
S3 Partners uses an algorithm to calculate daily short interest based on market data and insights from $2 trillion in assets the firm has under advisement, Dusaniwsky said.
The firm estimates that short-sellers' unrealized profits have climbed 7.3% in the last week and 18.6% in the last month. The data also suggest more short-sellers have bet against GE's stock and that no major investor has closed, or covered, its short position, the firm said.
""When short sellers see something like this they tend to jump in as a pack,"" Dusaniwsky said. ""We've not seen any covering in size.""
Markopolos, who blew the whistle on Bernard Madoff’s Ponzi scheme, said on Thursday GE was concealing deep financial problems, prompting a sharp rebuke from GE's new CEO. He said he was working with an undisclosed hedge fund to profit from short selling.
Concerns raised by the report were echoed on Tuesday by Fitch Ratings, which ranked GE near the top of risky insurers.

1595,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 20, 2019 04:31PM ET</span>","As trade war drags on, new Bunge CEO looks to avoid 'stroke-of-the-pen' risk","By Karl Plume
CHICAGO (Reuters) - A year removed from a losing bet that the U.S.-China trade war would be promptly resolved, global grains trader  Bunge  Ltd (N:BG) is facing an even more uncertain business environment, with a new chief executive who is determined not to get burned again.
Gregory Heckman, who joined Bunge's board late last year and took on the CEO role in January, told Reuters in an interview on Tuesday improving risk management at the 200-year-old company is a key focus as he oversees a portfolio review that is expected to last through the middle of 2020.
As the trade war enters its second year with no sign of a resolution, White Plains, New York-based Bunge and other grain traders are also navigating weather-reduced crops in the United States, a herd-culling hog disease in China that has slashed demand for soybeans and currency gyrations that have fueled uncertainty in top soymeal exporter Argentina and elsewhere.
Bunge's surprise loss in last year's second quarter, when bets on a quick trade war resolution turned sour, and another loss-triggering bet in the fourth quarter as trade tensions eased is something Heckman is determined to avoid.
""We want to avoid any surprises from stroke-of-the-pen risk,"" Heckman said, referring to unforeseen risks such as abrupt government policy shifts or tweets by U.S. President Donald Trump.
Investors last year pointed to a culture at Bunge where traders took on more risk compared with rival trading houses as contributing to the loss.
""While we have to make certain decisions to manage the inherent risks and protect the margins in our crushing and our distribution and milling assets, we try to absolutely stay out of the way of any big changes that can happen,"" Heckman said.
The company is improving coordination between its risk management and commercial teams and doing more scenario analysis to make sure that any bets are appropriately weighed against earnings prospects, he said.
Grain merchants like Bunge and rivals Archer Daniels Midland Co (N:ADM), Cargill Inc and Louis Dreyfus Co, known as the ABCD quartet of global grain trading giants, have already been restructuring their businesses and cutting costs after a years-long crop supply glut that thinned margins and sapped profits.
Heckman joined Bunge's board as part of a deal to ease activist investor pressure on the company following a string of weak results that made it vulnerable to takeover attempts by ADM and global commodities trader  Glencore  Plc (L:GLEN).
Heckman, a founding partner of private investment firm Flatwater Partners and the former CEO of grains trader Gavilon Group, declined to comment on whether the company was currently in takeover talks.
Rising market uncertainty has stiffened near term earnings headwinds for Bunge since it reported better-than-expected second-quarter earnings last month, Heckman said.
Bunge left its full-year 2019 earnings guidance unchanged when it announced second-quarter results on July 31, but warned that uncertainty from African swine fever and the trade war meant more of the profit for the second half of 2019 would come in the fourth quarter.
""We thought that our (second-half 2019) earnings would be largely weighted to Q4. It's probably even more so now,"" Heckman said.
Bunge is looking to streamline the company's operations and maximize profit as part of its ongoing portfolio optimization program. It unveiled a new global operating model in May and announced last week that its headquarters would move to St. Louis from White Plains, New York.
The effort has also found a new home for Bunge's sugar business, long a drag on earnings, in a Brazilian bioenergy joint venture with  BP  Plc (L:BP).
The company is actively working on ""a number of other projects"" that will be announced as they are completed, Heckman said. He declined to elaborate on which businesses would be impacted.
""We've given ourselves an internal deadline to have the majority of the portfolio transformation and optimization work completed by the end of Q2 2020,"" he said."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department sued on Tuesday to block travel technology firm Sabre Corp's (O:SABR) $360 million acquisition of Farelogix Inc, saying in court papers that it was a ""dominant firm's attempt to eliminate a disruptive competitor.""
Last week, Sabre said it planned to close the deal announced in November by Wednesday unless the Justice Department sued. The companies agreed last week to extend the termination date of their acquisition agreement to April 30 to allow time for any Justice Department challenge to be resolved.
The suit, filed in U.S. District Court in Delaware, said the firms compete head-to-head to provide booking services to airlines, including offering IT solutions that allow airlines to sell tickets and ancillary products through traditional brick-and-mortar and online travel agencies to the traveling public.
""If allowed to proceed, the acquisition would likely result in higher prices, reduced quality, and less innovation for airlines and, ultimately, traveling American consumers,"" said Makan Delrahim, who heads the Justice Department’s Antitrust Division in a statement.
The government says Sabre, the dominant provider of booking services in the United States with over 50 percent of airline bookings through travel agencies, has for many years ""operated outdated technology and resisted innovation"" while Farelogix is ""an innovative technology company that has stepped in to address the needs of airlines and their customers.""
The suit says Sabre was ""so threatened"" by Farelogix's next-generation technology standard that in 2013 it urged the U.S. Transportation Department to block approval of the standard. It cites text messages between Sabre executives that the deal would ""entrench us more.""
Nearly 50 percent of airline bookings in the United States are made through travel agencies, the government said.
The department added that airlines have successfully leveraged Farelogix's market position to negotiate lower fees with Sabre.
Sabre said it would challenge the lawsuit as the Justice Department's claims reflected a ""fundamental misunderstanding of the industry"" and that the two companies' services were complementary rather than competitive.

Sabre, based in Southlake, Texas, had 2018 revenues of $3.9 billion, while Miami-based Farelogix had $42 million in revenues last year.

SEATTLE (Reuters) - Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co said on Tuesday it plans to add extra staff and hire ""a few hundred"" temporary employees at an airport in Washington state where it is storing many grounded 737 MAX jetliners, a key step in its best-case plan for resuming deliveries to airline customers in October.
The world's largest planemaker, burning cash as one of the worst crises in its history stretches into a sixth month, said the workers will assist with aircraft maintenance and customer delivery preparations at Grant County International Airport. 
The hiring plans are the first publicly detailed steps Boeing will take as it works to deliver hundreds of grounded 737 MAX jets to airlines globally, an undertaking that would amount to one of the biggest logistical operations in modern civil aviation. 
Chicago-based Boeing has been unable to deliver any 737 MAX aircraft since the single-aisle plane was grounded worldwide in March after two fatal crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia killed 346 people, cutting off a key source of cash and hitting margins.
GRAPHIC: Boeing posts worst quarterly loss ever - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/BOEING-RESULTS/0H001QEKZ7GT/index.html
Global airlines have had to cancel thousands of flights and use spare aircraft to cover routes that were previously flown with the fuel-efficient MAX, eating into their profitability. Many carriers have taken the MAX off their schedules late into the fall or early 2020.
Boeing reiterated on Tuesday that it was working toward getting the 737 MAX flying again commercially in the ""early fourth quarter"" after it wins approval of reprogrammed software for the stall-prevention system at the center of both crashes. 
In late July, U.S. Federal Aviation Administration Deputy Administrator Dan Elwell declined to be pinned down on Boeing's previously stated target of October for entry into service.
""We don't have a timeline,"" Elwell said. ""We have one criteria. When the 737 MAX has been - when the complications to it have been satisfactorily assessed, and the MAX is safe to return to service, that's the only criteria.""
Boeing said it plans to move all the aircraft from Moses Lake, an eastern Washington location where it runs test flights, to facilities in the Seattle and Everett areas where its factories are located. 
Hundreds of Boeing 737 MAX jets remain grounded worldwide, and Boeing has continued building the jets at a rate of 42 per month in the Seattle area. The U.S. planemaker is also storing freshly built aircraft outside its factories in Renton and Everett, around Seattle. It also has jets parked at a facility in San Antonio, Texas. 

The total cost so far of the 737 MAX crisis is more than $8 billion, mainly due to compensation the planemaker will have to pay airlines for the delayed deliveries and lower production.

1599,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 20, 2019 03:42PM ET</span>",General Electric insurance called 'risky' by Fitch; shares fall again,"By Alwyn Scott
NEW YORK (Reuters) -  General Electric  Co (N:GE) ranks among the riskiest backers of long-term care insurance, suffering from both high exposure to claims and a relatively small cash pile to pay them, Fitch Ratings said in a report on Tuesday that sent GE's shares tumbling.
The Fitch report, which the credit rating agency produces annually, echoed concerns raised last week by financial investigator Harry Markopolos, who estimated that GE has under-reserved by $29 billion for its long-term care policies.
GE stepped up its defense of its insurance accounting on Monday.
On Tuesday, the U.S. conglomerate reiterated comments it made on Monday https://www.ge.com/reports/follow-up-from-last-weeks-note in response to the Markopolos report. ""Our current reserves are well-supported for our long-term care portfolio characteristics,"" GE said. It provided details about how it set key assumptions used in determining its level of reserves. 
GE shares were down more than 3% at $8.40.
The reports by Markopolos and Fitch reignite debate about whether GE has set aside enough money to cover its long-term care liabilities or will need to put up many billions more, potentially upending its plan to strengthen its fragile finances. 
To deal with GE's debt load of $105 billion and low cash inflow, Chief Executive Officer Larry Culp is selling businesses to pay down debt. Analysts said any money diverted to reserves could constrict how much Culp could cut GE's debt.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) said on Monday that its analysis showed GE's reserves were likely adequate. ""We continue to view GE's block as having high reserves on a relative basis to peers,"" Goldman wrote. In March, Reuters similarly found GE's reserves were in line with comparable insurers.
But others said long-term policies differ significantly in benefits and costs to insurers. In general, long-term care coverage, which pays for assisted living and nursing home stays, has turned out to be far more expensive than insurers assumed when they sold policies decades ago, and has tipped some insurers into financial loss and even bankruptcy.
Fitch said its analysis found GE and many other insurers still have not set aside enough money to cover losses expected on long-term care policies, which are unusually risky because the costs are volatile and vulnerable to interest rate changes. Even insurers that have taken a more conservative stance and set aside more money than GE have not avoided losses, Fitch said.
HIGH EXPOSURE
But GE also has ""very high"" exposure to long-term care for more than 250,000 retirees and others who receive benefits paid for by such policies, Fitch Ratings analyst Anthony Beato told Reuters. 
GE ranked second on Fitch's list of the 16 riskiest long-term care insurers, just below Genworth Financial Inc (N:GNW), a company that GE spun out in 2004. The other insurers cited as having below average reserves and very high exposure are  Unum Group  (N:UNM) and Senior Health Insurance Co of Pennsylvania, Fitch said.
In a statement, Genworth said its believes its reserve-setting process is appropriate and that it strong disagrees with Fitch's view that its assumptions about future premium increases are too optimistic. 
Unum did not comment on the content of the Fitch report. Senior Health did not respond to requests for comment.
GE scored high, Beato said, because it has mostly older policies written when the costs of long-term care were poorly understood. A large portion of GE's policies also provide lifetime benefits and some contain inflation protection benefits.
""When you compound all of that together, (GE's portfolio) looks much riskier than what the rest of the industry maintains,"" Beato said.
GE's insurance group also has only about $1 billion in capital on a statutory accounting basis, Beato said. While GE, as the parent, has put in money to shore up reserves in the past, Fitch did not factor that into its rankings because it wanted a comparison of reported statutory capital levels across the industry, Beato said.
""Should GE have to increase reserves further, the capital base continues to be dwarfed by this very large exposure"" at GE's insurance operating subsidiary, Beato said.
Last week, GE audit committee chairwoman Leslie Seidman said Markopolos' analysis was not accurate. ""I'm not sure (he) really understands the accounting in this area,"" she said in an interview on CNBC. 

GE did not make those comments about Fitch's report on Tuesday, but said it stood by its own accounting.

1600,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 20, 2019 03:40PM ET</span>",U.S. regulators hand Wall Street a major win with stripped-down 'Volcker Rule',"By Pete Schroeder
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. banking regulators on Tuesday eased trading regulations for Wall Street banks, giving them one of their biggest wins under the Trump administration but drawing criticism from consumer activists who warned of potential risks to taxpayers. 
The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) approved the revamped version of the so-called ""Volcker Rule,"" which aims to ban lenders that accept U.S. taxpayer-insured deposits from engaging in proprietary trading. 
The changes, first proposed in May 2018, followed years of lobbying by banks, including  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS), JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) and  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS), which have long complained the rule is too vague and complex. 
The new rule gives banks more leeway in terms of trading activity and simplifies how banks can tell if that trading is permitted by law.
While many regulatory experts have agreed the prior rule was too cumbersome, the changes were criticized by consumer groups and Democratic lawmakers who say a rewrite could put taxpayers at risk. 
FDIC Commissioner Martin Gruenberg, a Democrat who backed the Volcker rewrite proposed in May 2018, voted against the final rule Tuesday, saying it would ""effectively undo"" the rule's protections. 
In particular, he warned that the new rule narrows the definition of banned trading in a way that could free up banks to engage in riskier bets with potentially billions of dollars in financial instruments.
The other three FDIC board members, all Republicans, voted in favor.
Democratic Representative Maxine Waters, who chairs the House Financial Services Committee, accused regulators of undercutting a cornerstone of Wall Street reforms introduced by the 2010 Dodd-Frank law.
""The final rule published today would curtail prohibitions in a manner that Congress never intended,"" she said in a statement calling on other regulators to halt the project. 
Analysts say the final rule, which is significantly different from the proposed 2018 version, could also be vulnerable to legal challenges. 
The rewrite aims to clarify which trades are exempt from the ban, such as when banks facilitate client trades and hedge risks, and to expand those exemptions. The final rewrite scraps a proposed new test for identifying proprietary trading that banks complained would have made the rule even more complicated. 
That proposed ""accounting test"" was meant to replace a more subjective test that aimed to identify if a trader intended a trade to be speculative. But banks argued it could apply to a host of additional financial instruments not meant to be covered by the rule. 
The final rule scraps that proposal for large Wall Street firms, instead simplifying the original test and only applying it to much smaller banks.
At the same time, the rewrite simplifies a separate part of the rule which makes it easier for banks to invest in hedge funds or private equity funds. Regulators said they expect to propose further easing of the ""covered funds"" aspect of the rule, including for foreign firms, later this year.
The banking industry hailed the rule, while calling for regulators to expedite that additional relief.
""We urge the regulators to finish the job of Volcker Rule reform,"" said Kevin Fromer with the Financial Services Forum, an industry group that represents the CEOs of the nation's biggest banks. 
The rule will become effective on Jan. 1, 2020, but banks will have one year to comply. 

The OCC and the FDIC are two of five regulators charged with implementing the rule. The others - the Federal Reserve, the Securities and Exchange Commission, and the Commodities Futures Trading Commission - are expected to approve the new rule soon.

1603,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 20, 2019 01:41PM ET</span>","Drugmakers Endo, Allergan agree to $15 million in settlements in major opioid case","By Nate Raymond
(Reuters) - Endo International Plc (O:ENDP) and Allergan Plc (N:AGN) have agreed to pay $15 million to avoid going to trial in October in a landmark case by two Ohio counties accusing various drug manufacturers and distributors of fueling the U.S. opioid epidemic.
The tentative deals disclosed on Tuesday came ahead of the first trial to result from 2,000 lawsuits pending in federal court in Cleveland largely by local governments seeking to hold drug companies responsible for the deadly epidemic.
Endo announced said it had reached an agreement-in-principle to pay Cuyahoga and Summit counties $10 million to and provide them up to $1 million worth of two of its of its drug products free of charge.
Allergan has tentatively agreed to pay $5 million to resolve claims involving its branded opioids, though the deal does not resolve claims involving generic painkillers, said Frank Gallucci, a lawyer for Cuyahoga County.
Allergan did not respond to requests for comment.
The accords are the first to result from the counties' cases, which were selected for the first bellwether, or test, trial in the litigation to allow parties to gauge the value of the remaining claims and inform potential settlement talks.
Other companies still set to face trial on Oct. 21 include drugmakers Purdue Pharma LP, Teva Pharmaceutical (NYSE:TEVA) Industries Ltd (TA:TEVA) and Johnson & Johnson (N:JNJ) and drug distributors McKesson Corp (N:MCK),  Cardinal Health  Inc (N:CAH) and AmerisourceBergen Corp (N:ABC).
Endo's chief legal officer, Matthew Maletta, called the settlement a ""favorable outcome"" and stressed its value should not be extrapolated to any other opioid-related cases.
Endo, which in 2017 withdrew its painkiller Opana ER from the market, said the settlement includes no admission of wrongdoing.
Opioids were involved in 400,000 overdose deaths from 1999 to 2017, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
More than 2,300 lawsuits by state and local governments are pending nationally, accusing drug manufacturers of deceptively marketing opioids in ways that downplayed their risks and drug distributors of failing to detect and halt suspicious orders.
The companies deny wrongdoing, saying they complied with their legal obligations and did not cause the epidemic.
Most of the lawsuits are before U.S. District Judge Dan Polster in Cleveland, who has pushed for a settlement and will preside over the bellwether trial.
Purdue and Teva this year settled claims by Oklahoma's attorney general for $270 million and $85 million, respectively, ahead of a trial before a state-court judge.

The state subsequently took J&J to trial. A ruling is expected next week.

The owner of the iconic venue, as well as the New York Knicks and New York Rangers, reported a loss per share of $3.08 on $263.6 million in revenue, compared with estimates for a loss of $2.64 on $270.1 million in revenue.
MSG Entertainment revenue slipped 6% from the year-ago period to $174 million, while MSG Sports revenue dropped 32% to $90 million. 
Shares fell nearly 8% in midday trading.
The company said its decrease in revenue was mostly due to a new accounting standard from contracts, which was offset by revenue from other live-sporting events.
“Looking ahead, we remain confident in the strength of our core businesses and expect fiscal 2020 to be an important year as we work to complete the proposed sports spin-off and begin to usher in the company's next chapter, with MSG Sphere in Las Vegas starting to take shape,” CEO James Dolan said in a press release.

1610,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 20, 2019 12:49PM ET</span>","Home Depot beats quarterly profit estimates, warns of tariff impact","By Uday Sampath Kumar
(Reuters) -  Home Depot  Inc (N:HD) beat quarterly profit estimates on Tuesday as it sold more big-ticket items to high-spending builders and handymen, while flagging the potential impact of U.S. President Donald Trump's ongoing trade tussle with China on consumers.
The home improvement chain, which has distanced itself from co-founder Bernie Marcus' support for Trump's re-election campaign, blamed the impact of the trade dispute as well as a continued slump in lumber prices for a cut in its full-year sales forecast.
Still, the company's shares were up 4.4% at $217.11 by midday as investors shrugged off the warning, which analysts said was largely expected.
The United States' proposed tariffs on an additional $300 billion worth of goods have sent jitters through Wall Street, with companies warning that prices for U.S. shoppers could rise, potentially hurting demand. 
Home Depot estimated the proposed 10% levies, currently scheduled to go into effect on Sept. 1 and Dec. 15, along with the 25% tariffs already in effect, could raise its cost of sales by $2 billion - about 2% of its annual sales.
""We will work with each of our suppliers in negotiating that tariff cost, and my suspicion is, at the end of the day, it won't be quite that much,"" outgoing Chief Financial officer Carol Tome told Reuters.
Wall Street analysts said the impact from the latest round of tariffs on earnings is more likely to come from a hit to consumer demand rather than an increase in expenses.
""A tariff is a tax and not knowing how the consumer is going to react to that is probably prudent given the environment we're in right now,"" Gordon Haskett analyst Chuck Grom said.
""It's more of the impact on Home Depot's consumer spending than expenses.""
Home Depot said it now expects 2019 sales to rise about 2.3%, down from a prior forecast of a 3.3% increase.
However, the company recorded a bigger-than-expected profit in the second quarter, selling more products to professional customers such as electricians, plumbers and builders who typically make larger, more frequent purchases.
The Atlanta-based chain, which is looking to broaden its business beyond its core ""do-it-yourself"" customers, said its average bill amount rose 1.7% to $67.3 in the reported quarter.
Lumber prices, however, continue to weigh on the company's sales as roughly 8% of its revenue comes from sales of the commodity.
Lumber futures (LBc1) have fallen about 16% since their 2019 highs in early February as land and labor shortages have constrained builders' ability to construct new houses, creating a supply glut for the key building material.
That prompted Home Depot to cut its full-year same-store sales growth forecast as well to 4% from 5%.
Home Depot's net sales rose 1.2% to $30.84 billion in the second quarter ended Aug. 4, marginally missing analysts' average estimate of $30.98 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

It posted a profit of $3.17 per share, beating analysts' estimates of $3.08 per share.

1611,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 20, 2019 12:47PM ET</span>","Home Depot Cuts Sales Outlook on Tariffs, Lumber Price Deflation","(Bloomberg) -- Terms of Trade is a daily newsletter that untangles a world embroiled in trade wars. Sign up here. 
 Home Depot  Inc (NYSE:HD). cut its revenue forecast on lumber price deflation and concern that President Donald Trump’s recently announced tariffs will hurt U.S. consumption.
Same-store sales -- a key gauge of a retailer’s performance -- rose 3% in the second quarter, trailing the average 3.2% projection, according to Consensus Metrix. The company now sees 4% growth for the full year, down from a previous forecast for 5%.Key Insights
For years since the recession Home Depot has been riding the tide of rising home prices, since homeowners often spend more when they see their properties increasingly as an investment. But the overall home market has moderated from a few years ago, and now the 20% drop in the cost of lumber in the past year is adding to price pressure for Home Depot.Tariffs remain a question mark for consumer-facing companies, challenged with rising costs for some goods as the Trump administration gets set to launch more duties on imports from China.There’s about a two-quarter lag for orders, meaning the follow-through of slowing home building is still hitting companies like Home Depot that are closely tied to housing. Still, the company maintained its earnings per share forecast for the year.Market Reaction
Home Depot fell as much as 0.5% in premarket trading Tuesday ahead of the announcement. The stock had advanced 21% this year through Monday’s close, exceeding gains in the S&P 500 Index.Get More

Morgan survey showed on Tuesday.
The share of investors who said on Monday they were ""long,"" or holding more longer-dated Treasuries than their portfolio benchmarks, exceeded those investors who said they were ""short,"" or holding fewer longer-term government debt issues than their benchmarks, by 1 percentage point.
This was the smallest margin since July 8, and less than a 9 point gap a week ago, J.P. Morgan said.
Last Thursday, 30-year bond yields (US30YT=RR) fell to a record low of 1.916%, while 10-year yields (US10YT=RR) touched a three-year trough of 1.475%, according to Refinitiv data.
Longer-dated yields declined more than shorter-dated ones as worries about trade tensions between China and the United States and a global economic slowdown touched off another safe-haven stampede into U.S. government debt.
The move pushed 10-year yields below two-year yields , known as a curve inversion, for the first time in 12 years last week.
An inverted yield curve has preceded every U.S. recession in the past 50 years.
On Tuesday, longer-dated yields fell on the day but remained above last week's lows with 10-year yields last at 1.552%."

NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS) officially became a credit-card lender on Tuesday by rolling out its first product with Apple Inc (O:AAPL), but the bank has aspirations to grow much bigger in consumer lending, its chief executive said in an internal memo viewed by Reuters.
The virtual credit card, which officially launched to all U.S. customers, is Goldman's first, and it represents a big push by the Wall Street bank to build out its young consumer business. 
""Apple Card is big, but it's also a beginning,"" Goldman's CEO David Solomon wrote in an internal email to employees. ""In the decades to come, I expect us to be a leader in our consumer business, just like we are in our institutional and corporate businesses.""
Solomon did not say whether the bank is looking for other partners to launch more co-branded credit cards, as it did with Apple. 
But in describing the area at the bank's New York headquarters where ""the credit card business is being developed,"" he said the employees working there embody the strategy Solomon hopes will drive the bank's future growth: ""collaboration of teams across the firm's divisions...One Goldman Sachs.""

Goldman began selling consumer banking products to retail customers three years ago with the launch of Marcus, its online bank. Marcus now has more than $5 billion in loans and more than $50 billion in deposits from some 4 million customers in the United States and Britain.

1618,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 20, 2019 11:31AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Cigna seeks sale of group benefits insurance business - sources,"By David French
(Reuters) - U.S. health insurer  Cigna Corp  (NYSE:CI) is exploring a sale of its group benefits insurance business, which could be valued at as much as $6 billion, four people familiar with the matter said on Tuesday.
The unit for sale offers disability insurance as well as life and accidental death and dismemberment coverage to clusters of company employees. Cigna's move to shed it underscores its decision to focus on healthcare following its $54-billion acquisition of pharmacy benefits manager Express Scripts (NASDAQ:ESRX) Holding Co last year.
The Bloomfield, Connecticut-based company is working with an investment bank to run an auction for the group benefits business, the sources said. The unit could attract interest from other insurers that already have this product line and are seeking scale in that competitive market, the sources added.
While stating the company does not comment on rumors and speculation, a Cigna spokesman said: ""Given the dynamic marketplace, we continually review opportunities to ensure we continue to deliver value to our customers and clients.""
The sources asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential.
Cigna's group benefits business sits within the company's group disability and other operations division. This unit reported $1.31 billion of adjusted revenue in the three months to June 30, and covered 15.4 million people as of that date, according to Cigna's second-quarter financial statement.
Other health insurers have carried out similar divestitures.  Aetna Inc  (NYSE:AET) announced in October 2017 that it would sell its U.S. group life and disability unit for $1.45 billion to Hartford Financial Services Group (NYSE:HIG).
As health insurers face regulatory uncertainty amid political efforts to lower U.S. healthcare costs ahead of the 2020 presidential election, Cigna is hoping the acquisition of Express Scripts will help rein in its own costs.
That deal put Cigna in direct competition with CVS Health Corp (NYSE:CVS), which acquired Aetna last year, as well as UnitedHealth Group Inc (NYSE:UNH) and its pharmacy benefit manager Optum. 

Any proceeds from the sale of its group benefits insurance business could help Cigna pay down its long-term debt, which totaled $37 billion as of the end of June.

1619,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 20, 2019 11:11AM ET</span>","Taking aim at rivals, CBOE Europe's closing auction debuts with tiny volume","By Josephine Mason
LONDON (Reuters) - Europe's latest share trading platform debuted with a whimper this week as just 23,000 euros ($25,460) worth of stock changed hands in Monday's first closing auction, but its parent Chicago-based CBOE said plenty of customers were lining up to use it.
Mark Hemsley, European president of the exchange group best known for its futures and options products and which is home to the VIX volatility index, said the stocks traded were listed in Euronext's (PA:ENX) indexes in France, Belgium and the Netherlands.
""It's low volume because people are testing it out,"" Hemsley said. ""We have a good pipeline of customers who are going to try and use it.""
Turnover on the platform, dubbed Closing Cross, was tiny compared with the tens of billions of euros traded each day across Europe's major existing exchanges. But it represents the latest challenge to their market dominance.
Exchanges like  Euronext , the  London Stock Exchange  (L:LSE) and Deutsche Boerse (DE:DB1Gn) have a dominant position in share trading, including during the closing auctions which take place at the end of the trading day and which are capturing an ever bigger portion of daily activity.
It is these end of day auctions which Closing Cross targets and CBOE says it will be cheaper to use, without disclosing any detail on long-term pricing.
As much as 20% of daily volume in Europe is now traded in the five-minute closing auction, up from 13% three years ago, due in part to growing popularity of passive or index-trading investment products and greater regulation.
CBOE won't charge customers to use the new product until the end of the year. Aquis (L:AQX) has also launched a rival platform which is based on a monthly subscription.
Closing auctions have become a big revenue driver for the established exchanges, which charge more to trade in their closing auctions than during the day."

(Reuters) -  Elanco Animal Health  (N:ELAN) agreed to buy Bayer's (DE:BAYGn) veterinary drugs unit on Tuesday in a cash and stock deal valued at $7.6 billion, creating the second largest maker of medicines for pets and livestock and expanding Elanco's reach online.
The deal is the latest in the fast-growing animal health market, which has recently seen Elanco floated by Eli Lilly and Co (N:LLY) and rival U.S. drugmaker  Pfizer  (N:PFE) also spinning off its veterinary medicine business.
It also adds to the list of assets sold by Bayer, as the German company looks to slash debt from its $63 billion takeover of seed maker  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON) last year and as it braces for a potential settlement of lawsuits over an alleged cancer-causing effect of weedkiller Roundup.
The two companies said Bayer would receive $5.3 billion in cash and $2.3 billion worth of Elanco stock based on a price of $33.60 per share, the 30-day average price as of Aug. 6.
Elanco said the stock amounted to 68 million shares, or a stake of about 18.2% based on Refinitiv data, but the number of shares could rise or fall by as much as 7.5%, depending on Elanco's share price performance on the closing date.
Refinitiv data on 373 million outstanding shares does not yet take into account the dilutive effect from an as-yet unspecified capital increase that Elanco plans to carry out.
The price tag for the deal implies a multiple of 18.8 times adjusted core earnings, Bayer said, adding it would sell the equity stake over time.
Reuters reported last month that Bayer had approached Elanco to discuss a possible combination that would be number two after industry leader Zoetis (N:ZTS) and ahead of unlisted Boehringer Ingelheim - which bought animal health assets from Sanofi (PA:SASY) - and drugmaker Merck & Co (N:MRK). 
Market researchers expect the $44 billion animal health sector to grow 5%-6% per year, driven by an increase in livestock farming and, more importantly, by more people wanting to own pets and spending more money on their wellbeing.
FUNDING
Bayer is the world's largest maker of flea and tick control products for cats and dogs, with Elanco praising its ""top presence on Amazon"" with ""industry-leading e-commerce/retail capabilities.""
""The move combines our long-standing focus on the veterinarian, while meeting pet owners’ changing expectation of pet care and access to products,"" said Elanco CEO Jeffrey Simmons.
Elanco said it planned to fund the cash payout to Bayer with a combination of new debt and equity, with the size of the equity capital increase depending on future market developments.
Its shares were down 6.7% at $27.81 at 1430 GMT, while Bayer shares were unchanged. 
Bayer has recently sold its 60% stake in a chemical park operator as well as consumer health brands Dr. Scholl's and Coppertone, with combined proceeds of close to 2.4 billion euros ($2.7 billion).
Credit rating agency Moody’s said the Elanco deal would improve Bayer's ability to reduce its debt load and shoulder an expected settlement of the Roundup cases. S&P and Fitch, in turn, flagged the risk of a credit rating downgrade for Elanco. 
Equity analysts at Citi said Bayer sold near the top of the price range the brokerage had projected. It expects Bayer to buy back 3 billion euros worth of its own shares in 2020 to offset lower earnings per share from the divestments, with the remainder of the proceeds used to speed up debt payments.
Analysts have put the likely Roundup settlements at $5-$10 billion, with many saying the share price reflects exaggerated market expectations of a $20-$25 billion hit. Bayer strongly denies a carcinogenic effect from using Roundup.

Elanco said it expected the transaction to close by the middle of 2020.

""In order to optimize our performance, this also means reviewing and realigning our strategic orientation,"" Breitschwerdt, head of Mercedes-Benz Vans, said at the launch of an electric Mercedes-Benz van on Tuesday.
Daimler will seek cost-saving opportunities, including through a review of the company's' product portfolio, he said.
""We are looking at what we have and what we could have,"" Breitschwerdt said, adding that the X-Class midsize pickup truck was not delivering the sales volumes the company had hoped for.
""The X-Class is a niche product,"" the Daimler manager said at an event in Sindelfingen near Stuttgart. Furthermore Mercedes-Benz was not interested in entering the full-sized pickup truck segment, Breitschwerdt said.
He added that the vans division had too many management layers and the company was looking at ways to cut fixed costs without resorting to forced layoffs. Daimler's vans division employs 26,000 staff.
Mercedes-Benz launched the EQV, an electric van with a theoretical operating range of around 400 kilometers and the ability to charge the battery to 80% of capacity within 45 minutes, Daimler said.
The Mercedes-Benz EQV will hit showrooms in early 2020, the company said.
Breitschwerdt said he expected 15% to 25% of van sales by 2025 to be fully electric variants in the passenger segment and that he would consider diversifying the cell supplier base to ensure a sufficient supply of batteries as production ramps up.

Eskom, which supplies about 95% of the nation’s electricity and is seen as the biggest threat to the economy, is reliant on government bailouts as it struggles under 440 billion rand ($28.6 billion) of debt while reporting annual losses. Mantashe is one of the key officials charged with ensuring that there is a reliable power supply and Eskom becomes financially sustainable.
“The unions are going to get behind the plan,” Mantashe said in an interview with Bloomberg TV in Johannesburg. “We have a duty to do what is right for the country, more than what is just right for unions and workers, and we must do what can save the economy, what can save the country.”
Mantashe is a former secretary general of the National Union of Mineworkers, which along with the National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa, represent the bulk of the utility’s 46,665 workers. Both labor groups have rejected plans to separate Eskom into generation, distribution and transmission units under a state holding company, fearing the move would be precursor to privatization and job losses.
Eskom “must be redirected and managed properly,” said Mantashe, who served on the utility’s board in the 1990s. “If it fails, that would be a disaster for South Africa.”
Mantashe also revealed that a long-awaited update of the government’s future energy blueprint, known as the Integrated Resource Plan, will be presented to the cabinet within the next two weeks. Technologies being considered to replace aging coal stations include modular nuclear plants, gas, hydro, solar and wind, he said.

MUMBAI (Reuters) - Southeast Asia's biggest bank DBS Group Holdings (SI:DBSM) is preparing to enter the local credit card market in India in 2020, a senior company executive said on Tuesday.
The Singapore-based lender's move highlights its efforts to tap growth outside its home market to offset weakness in the local economy.
""We will launch our credit card by the second, or the third quarter of next year,"" said Shantanu Sengupta, head of consumer banking for DBS in India on the sidelines of a banking industry event in Mumbai.
Global rivals, such as  Citigroup  (N:C), are also looking to expand their credit card customer base in India. Earlier this year, India's top digital payments player Paytm announced plans to launch a card with Citi, giving the U.S. bank an opportunity to service some of Paytm's more than 300 million clients. 
India's credit card market is still small in comparison to its debit card market. The latest data from May showed 48.9 million credit card users in the country, compared with some 825 million with debit cards.
DBS, which had set a target of reaching a 5 million customer base in India by 2023, now expects to achieve this target early.
""We've crossed more than half the customer target already and hence we'll be able to cross the mark before the deadline,"" said Sengupta. He said DBS was not daunted by the ongoing economic slowdown in India and was currently focusing on increasing its domestic branches.
India is trying to boost adoption of electronic payments and recently moved to require banks and card payment networks to offer no-fee debit card transactions.

In a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification filed on Aug. 5, the Pittsburgh-based company said it expects to let go fewer than 200 workers following its decision to halt production at the Michigan facility.
In mid-June, the company said it would idle two blast furnaces at its Great lakes and Gary Works plants, citing lower steel prices and softening demand.
U.S. Steel said the lay-offs at the Michigan plant could last beyond six months. They will impact nearly every area of the facility, from blast furnace to finishing operations, a company spokeswoman told Reuters.
The lay-offs call into question claims President Donald Trump has made about the resurgence of the domestic steel industry. Last week in Pennsylvania, Trump said his 25% tariff on foreign imports has turned a ""dead"" business into a ""thriving"" enterprise.
Domestic steel prices did rise in the immediate aftermath of Trump's tariffs. But they have fallen dramatically amid improved supplies and weakening demand from the auto and farm machinery sectors.
Prices of hot-rolled coil are down nearly 37% from their 2018 peak.
U.S. Steel's stock price has plunged 73% since March 1, 2018, when Trump announced his decision to crack down on foreign imports.
An official at the United Steelworkers union, which represents U.S. Steel workers, said lay-offs were also planned for the Gary Works facility in Indiana. U.S. Steel's spokeswoman, however, said the company ""currently"" doesn't expect ""any employment level changes"" at the Indiana plant.
The city of Gary and the state of Indiana have offered U.S. Steel a $47 million tax break package to help it invest $750 million in modernizing Gary Works, its largest North American plant.
The state's tax credits and worker training grants were tied to the condition that U.S. Steel retain at least 3,875 jobs at Gary Works."

LONDON (Reuters) - The head of the world's biggest miner BHP (L:BHPB) (AX:BHP) said he will ""stick up for globalization"" and is more worried about the damage trade tensions are inflicting on the world economy than their impact on demand for the commodities BHP produces.
BHP on Tuesday posted annual profit of $9.12 billion, a bumper figure built largely on selling iron ore, coal and copper to China, the world's largest importer of commodities
BHP shares were trading 1.6% lower by 1130 GMT, as despite record dividends, analysts said they had expected even better results.
CEO Andrew Mackenzie told reporters in London protectionism was an act of economic self-harm.
""Economically this is causing disruption and the partial unraveling of global supply chains,"" Mackenzie said. ""We're not completely immune to some form of downturn and that's why we're nervous.""
Asked whether commodity cycles had peaked, he said he did not know, adding the company was ""anxious but ready"".
Prices of iron ore, which represents nearly 50 percent of BHP's core earnings, have fallen as the impact eases of supply disruption at the start of the year caused by a dam disaster in Brazil and extreme weather in Australia.
Trade tensions between the United States and China have also impacted market sentiment.
Mackenzie said he would stick up for the benefits of globalization and opposed moves toward greater intervention such as removing the independence of central banks.
""The people advocating this are committing economic self-harm,"" he said.
U.S. President Donald Trump has repeatedly criticized the U.S. Fed, accusing it of undermining the administration's economic policies."

(Reuters) - Shares of  Sarepta  Therapeutics Inc (O:SRPT) plummeted 17% on Tuesday after the U.S. health regulator, in a surprise move, declined to approve the drugmaker's newest treatment for a muscle-wasting disorder that mainly affects young boys.
Wall Street analysts expressed disbelief at the decision and at least five cut their price targets for the company's shares while stressing they still expected the company's second drug for Duchenne muscular dystophy (DMD) to eventually be approved.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration's so-called complete response letter (CRL) on Sarepta's new treatment, called Vyondys 53, cited risks of infection and kidney toxicity and is a blow to the company as it looks to solidify its leadership in treating DMD.
""We believe the setback can only be described as odd and we cannot help but feel there is more to the CRL than the issues cited,"" William Blair analyst Tim Lugo wrote in a client note.
By Share of the company were trading down nearly 18% at $98.80 in trading before the bell. Wall Street brokerages' median price target for the stock, however, is still $193, a 60.4% upside to current levels.
Exondys 51, the company's first DMD treatment, was approved in 2016 against the advice of the FDA's outside panel of experts and its own reviewers, who had questioned the drug's effectiveness.
The FDA's decision cited risks of infections and kidney toxicity seen in pre-clinical studies of Vyondys 53, which is also known as golodirsen.
The company said the doses used in those studies had been ten-fold higher than those used in clinical studies.
""Sarepta is being slapped on the wrist for the prior questionable accelerated approval of Exondys 51,"" said SVB Leerink analyst Joseph Schwartz.
""The FDA may be holding Sarepta to a higher standard now, but we are optimistic that golodirsen can overcome this speedbump on its way to an eventual approval,"" Schwartz added.
The past few weeks have been eventful for Sarepta.
The company's shares plunged earlier this month after a notice from the FDA showed that a patient on its gene therapy for DMD had developed a serious illness in an ongoing trial.
Sarepta said it was not known whether the patient had received its experimental therapy or a placebo in the trial, and that independent safety monitors decided the study should continue.
""While none of these single events are catastrophic, the cumulative effect is wearing on investor patience,"" Baird analyst Brian Skorney said.
The Exondys 51 drug targets 13% of DMD patients, while the newest treatment would have treated about 8% of DMD patients. Analysts have forecast annual sales of golodirsen to reach a peak of nearly $400 million in five years.
The company is also developing another similar treatment that would target a further 8% of the population."

The Solidarity union sued Denel last month, accusing it of deducting tax and other payments from employees' salaries then failing to hand the cash over to the South African Revenue Service (SARS) and other bodies.
Solidarity claimed Tuesday's ruling as a victory in what it described as a broader fight to hold state firms to account. A Denel spokeswoman it had not received details of the ruling but would meet its obligations. She said Denel had approached SARS to see if it could delay payments.
The lawsuit came after Denel, a cornerstone of South Africa's once-mighty defense industry, said it would not be able to pay employees their full salaries in June and asked the government for a 2.8 billion rand ($182.43 million) cash injection a week later.
Denel's recapitalization request, one of a clutch of bailouts needed for debt-ridden state-run companies, has piled pressure on President Cyril Ramaphosa who has promised to overhaul Africa's most industrialized economy after decades of corruption and mismanagement.
Investors and credit rating agencies raised the alarm in July, when the government said it would give power utility Eskom 59 billion rand of additional financial support over the next two years, on top of an already-promised bailout of 230 billion rand spread over the next decade.
Anton van der Bijl, head of Solidarity's Legal Services, told Reuters he thought the ruling would cost Denel millions of rand.
""It is regrettable that we had to go to court just to draw Denel's attention to payments that it should have made a while ago.”
The company, which produces military equipment from ammunition to attack helicopters, has said it is trying to turn its operations around by exiting loss-making businesses and pushing to win contracts to ease liquidity constraints."
1639,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 20, 2019 07:40AM ET</span>","U.S. yield curve: Invert, steepen, repeat","By Richard Leong
(Reuters) - A swift steepening of the U.S. 2-year/10-year yield curve after it inverted last week may have given investors hope that the United States can escape recession. They should probably take a breath.
History indicates that the reprieve may be brief, before a more sustained, severe flip occurs.
A catalyst for another inversion might happen later this week if the Federal Reserve's minutes on its July 30-31 meeting on Wednesday or Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's speech on Friday at the Jackson Hole economic conference were to suggest U.S. policy-makers are not fully on board for an all-out rate-cutting mode, which could drive short-term rates higher and flatten the curve. For an explainer on the yield curve:
The yields on 2-year and 10-year Treasury notes inverted for the first time since 2007 last week, rattling investors who saw this as an omen that a U.S. recession is coming. 
While the 2-and-10-year inversion has gone away for now, the previous three bouts of inversion on this part of the yield curve have shown a pattern: a steepen and then return to a more sustained or deeper inversion more than once before a recession hits.
The inversion between three-month Treasury bill rate and 10-year Treasury yield - which economists and some Fed economists believe is a more reliable recession indicator - has been in place since May. That curve inverted in March, steepened in April and then inverted again.
While the stock market reacted with fear after the inversion, there was skepticism from some that a recession would necessarily follow. The yield curve retraced its inversion and stocks rebounded on Monday.
""We would caution against seeing the inversion of the yield curve as an infallible predictor of an economic contraction or a bear market,"" UBS Global Wealth Management's chief investment officer Mark Haefele said. 
Currently, some investors said the latest episode of the inversion is overstating the chances of a recession. They argue the Fed's openness to lower borrowing costs would prolong the current economic expansion, which became the longest on record last month.
""We do not view the inversion of the yield curve as a recessionary signal, and see central banks' dovish pivot stretching the growth cycle,"" said BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) Investment Institute on Monday.
Here is how the curve has performed in recent years after an initial inversion: 
In February 2006 when the 2-to-10-year part of the curve inverted, that lasted for about a month before 10-year yields rose above their two-year counterparts.
Then the inversion re-emerged about three months later and largely persisted into May 2007. 
At the time, the Federal Reserve was at the tail end of a rate-hiking campaign that ultimately raised the federal funds rate to 5.25% in June 2006 from 1.25% in June 2004.
""Although the moderation in the growth of aggregate demand should help to limit inflation pressures over time, the Committee judges that some inflation risks remain,"" Fed policy-makers said in a statement after their June 2006 meeting.
Some investors had downplayed the inversion as a harbinger of a looming economic downturn.

In mid-1998, the 2-to-10-year part of the yield curve inverted briefly before a more sustained inversion took place in 2000 while the dotcom stock bubble was imploding which sent the economy into a recession. 
(Graphic: U.S. yield curve in the early 2000s link: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/12/4921/4878/U.S.%20yield%20curve%20in%20early%202000s).
From December 1988 to May 1990, the 2-to-10-year part of yield curve inverted on five separate occasions before a recession June 1990.

In the late 1970s to the early 1980s, curve inversion was a mainstay as then Fed Chairman Paul Volcker sought to combat double-digit inflation by tightening money supply, a move that propelled the federal funds rate above 17% in 1980.

Kohl's shares, which are down 27% so far this year, underperforming the S&P 500 index, were up nearly 6% in premarket trade.
Kohl's has been investing in several new partnerships to woo more shoppers. Last month, it expanded a returns program it launched with Amazon in 2017, through which items bought on the e-commerce website could be returned at Kohl's stores, generating additional sales for the retailer. Kohl's also stocks Amazon's Echo Dot speakers and Kindle e-readers at its stores.
The retailer has also teamed up with millennial-focused Popsugar to launch a new line of clothes and announced last week it would sell a selection of emerging brands online and in more than 50 stores, with Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) helping it to identify trendy brands.
Sales at stores open for at least a year fell 2.90% in the second quarter. Analysts on average were expecting a drop of 2.50%, according IBES data from Refinitiv.
However, the company said that its comparable sales turned positive during the last six weeks of the second quarter with 1% growth.
""This positive trend has continued into August driven by a successful start to the back-to-school season. We are confident that our upcoming brand launches, program expansions, and increased traffic from the Amazon returns program will incrementally contribute to our performance,"" Chief Executive Officer Michelle Gass said.
Net income fell to $241 million, or $1.51 per share, in the quarter ended Aug. 3 from $292 million, or $1.76 per share, a year earlier.
Excluding certain items, the company earned $1.55 per share, beating analysts expectation of $1.53.
Net sales fell to $4.17 billion from $4.31 billion a year earlier missing expectations of $4.20 billion.
Kohl's also maintained its fiscal 2019 adjusted profit forecast of a $5.15-$5.45 per share range."

Walt   Disney   (NYSE:DIS) fell 0.4%, while Netflix declined 0.8%.

COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Denmark's  Jyske Bank  (CO:JYSK) will begin charging wealthy individuals for deposits instead of paying interest, it said on Tuesday, less than two weeks after launching the world's first negative interest rate mortgage.
Jyske Bank, Denmark's second-largest lender, said it would introduce a negative interest rate of 0.6% for clients depositing more than 7.5 million Danish crowns ($1.1 million).
""The negative interest rate environment that has affected the Danish market since the spring of 2012, only interrupted in 2014, now seems to be of a rather permanent nature,"" Jyske Chief Executive Anders Dam said in a statement.
""Market expectations indicate that the negative interest rate environment will last for several years,"" Dam added.
The Nordic country was among the first to introduce negative rates in 2012. Earlier this month, Jyske became the first to offer a negative rate on a home loan, in effect paying customers 0.5% to borrow money for 10 years.
Such moves reflect prospects of a global recession, prompting central banks to try to kick-start the economy by measures such as cutting lending rates.
Denmark's largest lender  Danske Bank  (CO:DANSKE) has said it has no plans to introduce negative interest rates on deposits, though Switzerland's UBS (S:UBSG) has said it would impose a negative rate of 0.75% on wealthy clients who deposit more than 2 million Swiss francs ($2 million) with its Swiss bank.
Denmark last month became the first developed economy in this year's global plunge in bond yields to have negative yields on all its government bonds."

HONG KONG (Reuters) - China's Huawei will spend more on production equipment this year to ensure supply continuity, cut redundant roles and demote inefficient managers as its grapples with a ""live-or-die moment"" in the wake of U.S. export curbs, founder Ren Zhengfei said.
His remarks come as the United States said this week it will extend by 90 days a reprieve that permits Huawei Technologies to buy components from U.S. companies to supply existing customers, but it also moved to add more than 40 of Huawei's units to its economic blacklist.
In a memo sent to employees on Monday loaded with military metaphors, 74-year-old Ren asked staff to work aggressively towards sales targets as the firm goes into ""battle mode"" to survive the crisis.
""The company is facing a live-or-die moment,"" Ren, a former Chinese army officer, said in the memo, which was seen by Reuters. Huawei confirmed the contents of the memo.
""If you cannot do the job, then make way for our tank to roll; And if you want to come on the battlefield, you can tie a rope around the 'tank' to pull it along, everyone needs this sort of determination!""
Huawei is a key theme in a broader, year-long U.S.-China trade war, with Washington slapping it with the trade ban in May citing national security risks. Huawei, however, posted a 23% revenue jump in the first half, helped by strong smartphone sales in its home market.
Ren said in the memo, ""In the first half, our results looked good, it is likely because our Chinese clients were sympathetic and made payments in time, the big volume made cash flow look good, this doesn't represent the real situation.""
But he expressed confidence in Huawei's full-year results and said it needs to ""spend the money and solve the production continuity issue"" by ramping up strategic investment on things including production equipment.
According to the memo, Huawei, which employs nearly 190,000 people around the world, is reforming its operation globally by granting more power to the frontline, cutting out reporting layers and eliminating inefficient posts.
""In 3-5 years time, Huawei will be flowing with new blood,"" Ren said. ""After we survive the most critical moment in history, a new army would be born. To do what? Dominate the world,"" Ren said.
While Ren said in June the ban was worse than expected and that Huawei's revenue may stay flat in the next two years, in the memo he called on staff to try their best in meeting the sales target outlined at the start of the year before the ban - which was to grow its revenue to around $125 billion from more than $100 billion in 2018.
He also warned of cash flow risk if receivables are not paid in time. He asked staff to be conservative in ensuring dues were paid in time by clients, because otherwise the lack of liquidity could be fatal to the company."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Corporate America is responsible for providing economic benefits to all, not just its investors, the Business Roundtable group said on Monday. 
The group's ""statement of corporate purpose"" was signed by the heads of more than 180 U.S. companies, including the CEOs of Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN), American Airlines (O:AAL), the largest airline in the world; and JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM), the biggest American bank. 
Although largely symbolic, the group's statement goes against a roughly 30-year viewpoint that corporations exist to serve shareholders. 
That notion has guided every major business decision, from how much a CEO is paid to whether a company invests in its employees or fires them. 
The statement comes amid calls for greater corporate responsibility from Democratic candidates for president and employee activists who want companies to take stances on issues outside of the corporate sphere. 
The chairman of the Business Roundtable, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, said there is a growing wealth gap in the United States, and prioritizing all stakeholders will lead to a healthier economy. 
""The American dream is alive, but fraying,"" Dimon said in a statement. ""Major employers are investing in their workers and communities because they know it is the only way to be successful over the long term."" 
The statement outlined five commitments, including to invest in employees by providing fair wages and ""important benefits,"" support communities and ""protect the environment."" 
The group's statement could be significant because the previous tenet - shareholder primacy - fueled a range of decisions now commonplace at publicly traded companies, said Barbara Dyer, an MIT Sloan School of Management professor. 
""If you think that the primary thing is to generate shareholder value then you want to cut down any costs that are unduly high,"" Dyer said. 
In the 1980s, that led to staff cuts and efforts to break unions. 
Dyer said the Business Roundtable may have changed its perspective now because the tight labor market presents an opportunity to rethink ""how we view and how we invest in people.""
She added, however, that it is unclear whether the statement represents a real turning point and said she was skeptical it will create major changes, for example, in how executive compensation is structured. ""I don’t have any illusions that that's going to change any time soon.""
Maura Cowley, a director with the Sierra Club Resist campaign, said the statement lacks substance because some of the companies that signed it are ""actively making the climate crisis worse."" 
""It's hard to take this letter seriously without further details or next steps,"" Cowley wrote in an emailed statement. ""Until these sentiments are met with substantial action by these companies it is hard to see this as anything other than words on paper."" 
One investor group, the Council of Institutional Investors, criticized the group's statement, saying that ""accountability to everyone means accountability to no one."" Investors are a positive force pushing companies to focus on long-term performance, it said. 
""It is government, not companies, that should shoulder the responsibility of defining and addressing societal objectives with limited or no connection to long-term shareholder value,"" the Council said. 

The AFL-CIO labor group did not immediately reply to a request for comment on the Business Roundtable's statement.

LONDON (Reuters) - European shares followed their Asian counterparts higher on Tuesday as investors bet possible monetary and fiscal stimulus measures would help stave off a major global economic downturn.
After a tumultuous first half of August as investors dumped equities and poured their money into government debt and other safe haven assets, some calm has returned to markets this week as traders welcomed talk of more stimulus in China and Germany.
In early European trade, the pan-region Euro Stoxx 600 rose 0.2%, the German DAX gained 0.1%, and Britain's FTSE rose 0.36%. That followed gains in Asia. 
The MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, rose 0.1% and followed a decent rebound on Monday.
Investors were cheered by signs policymakers were willing to do more to support their economies in the grip of international trade frictions, led by the bruising Sino-U.S. tariff tussle, and not everyone thinks the economy is in as bad shape as the market selloff last week implied.
""We still see limited near-term recession risks as central banks' dovish pivot helps stretch the economic cycle, yet caution that trade and geopolitical tensions pose downside risks,"" strategists at BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) Investment Institute said in their weekly research note. 
China's new lending reference rate was set slightly lower on Tuesday after the central bank announced interest rate reforms designed to reduce corporate borrowing costs, while Germany's right-left coalition government has said it would be prepared to ditch its balanced budget rule and take on new debt to counter a possible recession.
The immediate focus now shifts to the minutes of the U.S. Federal Reserve's last meeting due on Wednesday. Traders are also keenly waiting on the Fed's Jackson Hole seminar and a Group of Seven summit this weekend for clues on what additional steps policymakers will take to bolster growth.
Senior White House officials are discussing a temporary payroll tax cut to boost the economy, the Washington Post reported on Monday.
SAFE HAVENS STEADY
Safe haven assets, which panicked investors had flocked to last week, saw their prices steady on Tuesday.
Bond yields rose marginally but remained below three-year highs touched last week. The 10-year German bund yield fell 2 basis points to -0.67%, above the record low of -0.727%.
The U.S. Treasury 10-year bond yield was 2 basis points lower at 1.582%, also above recent three-year lows.
Financial markets went into a tailspin last week after the Treasury yield curve briefly inverted when short-term yields traded above those of long-term paper - the inversion has presaged previous recessions and is widely watched by markets as a harbinger of a downturn.
Spot gold prices rose 0.4% to $1,501 after tumbling 1.2% on Monday, their biggest daily drop in about a month. 
The Japanese yen, a popular currency for investors looking for safety, rose 0.2% to 106.41 yen per dollar but was well below the highs of 105.05 touched last week.
Elsewhere in currency markets the euro was little moved against the dollar at $1.1075 as traders prepare for the release of Fed minutes later in the week.
Investors will be watching the political situation in Italy, where Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte is set to address parliament on Tuesday afternoon (1300 GMT) to defend his record amid the growing chance of a snap general election. 
Conte might hand in his resignation immediately afterwards or could instead wait for a formal vote to make it clear he is being unseated by the far-right League.
In energy markets, oil prices rose on the broader market optimism. Brent crude gained 0.13% to $59.82 a barrel, after climbing 1.88% on Monday. U.S. crude was up marginally at $56.25 a barrel, after rallying 2.44% in the previous session.
UNCONVENTIONAL POLICY
The key for markets now is whether pledges for more accommodative policy, either monetary or fiscal or a combination of the two, are enough to assuage concerns about the state of the global economy and end fears of recession.
In a sign of how far some central banks are willing to ease, Australia's central bank discussed unconventional monetary policies including negative interest rates at its August board meeting, according to minutes of the Reserve Bank of Australia's (RBA) Aug. 6 meeting.
Antoine Bouvet, senior rates strategist at ING, said the RBA minutes were the most important news of the day because of what they said about easing more generally.
""It spells out what the market is implicitly pricing: non-standard measures are difficult to withdraw,"" he said. ""It is reasonable for rates markets to price those measures remaining a feature for a long time.""

1649,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 20, 2019 06:05AM ET</span>",U.S. whiskey exporters struggle after year of EU tariffs,"By Jonas Ekblom
BRISTOL, Pa. (Reuters) - When Europe's tariffs on U.S. whiskey hit in June 2018, craft distillery Mountain Laurel Spirits LLC lost 10% of its sales overnight as its European distributor simply stopped buying its award-winning Dad's Hat Pennsylvania Rye Whiskey.
Foreign governments subject to U.S. President Donald Trump's trade tariffs have targeted American distilleries and their bourbon and rye whiskeys for retaliation. The industry fears new tariffs under consideration by the U.S. government could result in even higher tariffs on their products in Europe.
""We went from a marginally profitable business to breaking even,"" Mountain Laurel's owner and chemical engineer-turned-distiller, Herman Mihalich, said while testing his latest batch of rye whiskey in the sleepy hamlet of Bristol in southeast Pennsylvania.
U.S. whiskey exporters are struggling to recoup lost sales after shipments to Europe plummeted 21% between June 2018 and 2019, according to data from the Distilled Spirits Council, a U.S. industry group.
In the 12 months before the tariffs hit, the United States exported $757 million of rye and bourbon. From July 2018 to June 2019 exports were $597 million. Exports are a sizeable chunk of sales the U.S. whiskey industry, which generated $3.6 billion in revenue in 2018.
The Distilled Spirits Council said that 63% of U.S. whiskey exports have faced retaliatory tariffs from the European Union, China, Turkey, Canada and Mexico. The EU currently levies 25% tariffs on U.S. whiskey.
The U.S. Trade Representative's office is preparing to slap tariffs of up to 100% on $1.8 billion worth of European spirits and wine in response to illegal European aid to planemaker Airbus (PA:AIR), the most recent development in a 15-year-long trade dispute between Europe and the United States.
""American whiskeys have become collateral damage,"" said Chris Swonger, chief executive of the Distilled Spirits Council at an Aug. 6 hearing with the U.S. Trade Representative. He urged Washington not to introduce the new tariffs because the industry fears Europe will introduce even more tariffs in retaliation.
The group said that at least 11,200 to 78,600 jobs could be lost in the beverage, alcohol and hospitality sectors, which currently employ 2.4 million Americans, if the EU-U.S.-conflict worsened.
WHISKEY BOOM ENDING
The tariff war is capping a boom for U.S whiskey despite a surge in global demand for traditionally made spirits and cocktails. The Kentucky Distillers Association said that the production of Kentucky bourbon, a popular variety of U.S. whiskey, in 2018 reached its highest level - 1.7 million barrels - since 1972.
At the Aug. 6 hearing, Swonger testified that many of the Distilled Spirits Council's members, including exporting businesses from 45 U.S. states, have halted hiring and expansion plans and seen margins take a hit because of the tariffs.
One of them is Scott Harris of Catoctin Creek Distilling Co in Virginia, who has thousands of unfilled rye bottles. Anticipated European demand never materialized because of the EU levies, which have pushed prices too high for most European consumers.
The company had hoped that Europe could soak up at least a tenth of its sales and had bought a large inventory of European-sized bottles just as the tariffs hit.
Worse, Harris said he cannot do anything with the 700 ml bottles because the U.S. market mandatory standard is 750 ml bottles.
Catoctin Creek's European sales are today close to zero, and the few bottles it does sell are at a significant loss because the firm does not want to pass on the cost of tariffs to price-sensitive European customers.
""We had one distributor we signed a deal with. He just stopped returning our phone calls,"" Harris said. ""We've been trying very hard to get into the UK and France, and we can't get any distributor to talk to us right now.""
Several distillers interviewed by Reuters said that prior to the tariffs, Scottish or Irish whiskeys were generally more expensive in Europe, fueling thirst for cheaper U.S. varieties. But when the duties reversed the cost picture, European distributors lost interest in American rye and bourbon.
Getting into the European market was ""low-hanging fruit,"" said Amir Peay, owner of James E. Pepper Distilling Co in Lexington, Kentucky. His company had invested ""hundreds of thousands of dollars"" to break into the European market.
""The way the market is now is extremely disappointing,"" Peay said.
In Pennsylvania, Mountain Laurel Spirits has tried to offset sales declines by breaking into new markets in the United States, a far from easy task as each of the 50 U.S. states requires an in-state licensed wholesaler.
While there are exceptions and there are wholesalers that operate in several states, Mihalich complained that the contracts often have to be drawn up 50 different ways.
Other foreign markets outside of Europe are often hard to break into and often not worth the hefty investment for smaller distillers, several companies said.
Large spirit producers have also been forced to adjust to the tariffs. Brown–Forman Corp (N:BFb), maker of the world's most popular U.S.-made whiskey, Jack Daniels Tennessee whiskey, has lost $125 million due to the European tariffs.
Chief Executive Lawson Whiting said in June that the company takes the hit ""quite personal"" since it produces 60% of all U.S. whiskey.
""It is a targeted tariff at Brown-Forman,"" Whiting said."

1651,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 20, 2019 05:25AM ET</span>",StockBeat: Germany's Top Court Ends Real Estate Managers' Golden Age,"By Geoffrey Smith
Investing.com -- Has Germany’s Constitutional Court just killed the goose that laid the golden egg?
Investors in a handful of residential property managers will be thinking that on Tuesday, after a ruling that upheld a federal government regulation capping rental increases. The ruling threatens a business model that has been wildly successful in the last decade, in which companies such as Dax member Vonovia (DE:VNAn) and midcap Deutsche Wohnen (DE:DWNG) have used rock-bottom borrowing costs to gentrify cities such as Berlin, upgrading old buildings and then raising rents to levels that – while more in keeping with cities such other European capitals – have gone far beyond the ability of older tenants to pay.
Vonovia fell 1.8% on the news to a seven-week low, while Deutsche Wohnen fell 1.7% to its lowest since the start of 2017. Deutsche Wohnen, whose business is concentrated in Berlin where the rent issue is at its most acute, has lost nearly one-third of its value since the spring, when the city Senate, run by the two major left-wing parties and the Greens, floated new its own plans for tighter rent controls.
LEG Immobilien (DE:LEGn) and Tag Immobilien (DE:TEGG), two more real estate midcaps, fell 2.4% and 1.6%, respectively.
The Constitutional Court’s ruling referred to a different initiative by the federal government, but its language sets an ominous precedent in establishing a hierarchy of principles, putting social engineering above the rights of property owners to ask a market-driven price for their assets. That may make it harder for Deutsche Wohnen and Vonovia to challenge any more draconian plans enacted by the Berlin city Senate.
“It is in the public interest to steer against the expulsion of less economically strong population groups from popular neighborhoods,” the ruling stated in explaining its encroachment into the area of property rights, a principle that the German constitution typically defends robustly.
The federal government’s “Rent Brake” limits rental increases to 10% above a local reference price derived from prevailing rental levels, but allows for some exceptions in the case of new build and restorations. A federal government committee agreed in principle at the weekend to extend the restriction through 2025. 
Elsewhere in Europe Tuesday, markets traded mixed in thin volumes, as a weak economic outlook and political uncertainty stopped them following the lead from Wall Street on Monday and Asia overnight. The benchmark Euro Stoxx 600 was down less than 0.1% at 373.56. The German Dax was down by a similar amount while the FTSE 100 was up 0.3%. Italy’s FTSE MIB lagged the rest of the continent, falling 0.6% amid expectations that Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte will resign later in the day, triggering the breakup of the current coalition and possibly new elections within the next couple of months."
1652,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 20, 2019 05:15AM ET</span>","Greene King Deal May Spell More U.K. Pub Closures, Say Analysts","(Bloomberg) -- Analysts see the potential for further pub closures after Hong Kong’s CK Asset Holdings Ltd. agreed to buy Greene King Plc in a deal that valued the U.K. company at about 2.7 billion pounds ($3.3 billion).
Greene King shares surged 51% on Monday to the highest level since the Brexit referendum in June 2016, after CK Asset’s bid of 850 pence a share in cash. Peers Marston’s Plc, JD Wetherspoon Plc and Mitchells & Butlers Plc also rose.
The deal follows private equity firm TDR Capital’s agreement to buy U.K. pub-chain operator EI Group Plc for about $1.6 billion in July.
“Nearly all the different industries within the listed Leisure space have seen a pick-up in private equity interest this year,”  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analyst Jamie Rollo wrote in a note.
Here’s a round-up of market views:
Morgan Stanley, Jamie Rollo
(Cut to equal-weight from overweight, PT raised to 850p from 690p)
The 850p per share bid implies a valuation of an estimated 9.2x enterprise value to Ebitda for calendar year 2020 The bid also represents a 0.5x premium to historical managed pub transactions over the last 20 yearsKepler Cheuvreux, Geoffroy Le Guyader
Proposed deal shouldn’t raise many competition issuesOffer values Greene King at 13.3x P/E 2019e and 9.26x EV/Ebitda 2019e, which is in line with the P/E multiples for the acquisition of peer EI GroupOffer looks fair, should be completed in December 2019CMC Markets, David Madden
The offer price “seems like a hefty price for a sector which has been under pressure” because of higher wages, higher business rates and a more fragile consumer environment The announcement has helped the pub sector as a whole because it may signal pub closures ahead, which could help the pubs that stay open “Price competition is key” and CK Asset’s investment might make sense if it can help lower pricesMarkets.com, Neil Wilson
The announced deal is “a bottle of champagne for shareholders,” but it may mean more pub closures Greene King owns the freehold or long leasehold on 81% of its properties, and CK Asset’s premium suggests the the Hong Kong firm “sees significant value in the property portfolio” "
1653,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 20, 2019 05:08AM ET</span>",Inverted Yield Curve: Is It Time to Worry Yet?,"(Bloomberg) -- Last year, U.S. 10-year yields weren’t low enough to really boost the equity market’s appeal. This summer, the inversion of the yield curve is suddenly triggering worries of a U.S. recession, while bund yields are deep into negative territory as Germany seems heading for an economic downturn. Yet there’s few signs of panic among equity traders.
Many in the market agree that a U.S. recession isn’t imminent. UBS strategists see the inverted yield curve more as “a statement on lackluster growth in the rest of the world,” and suggest a slowdown would take some time to materialize.
One interesting point they note is that European equities seem to have been more vulnerable than U.S. stocks to the gyration of the U.S. 10-year bond yield over the past six months.
The U.S. 10-year yield has only fallen below 1.6% on two previous occasions: mid-2012 and mid-2016. According to Citi strategist Jonathan Stubbs, it has worked well as a buy signal for European equities both times, with the DAX returning 23% on average over the next 12 months, the CAC 24%, and the FTSE 17%. Of course, with Fed cuts, ECB QE and trade concerns, things may be different this time, he says.
So, should we be worried? Not yet, according to JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) strategists including Mislav Matejka. Over the past six historical episodes, yield-curve inversion preceded recessions by 17 months on average, while the equity market peaked about 11 months after the inversion, they write. Even if the risk of a downturn next year is increasing, much can happen in the meantime. They still expect equities to make all-time highs into the first half of 2020 and see the current pull-back not lasting beyond early September as the ECB will start quantitative easing and the second Fed rate cut might be bigger than the first.
The bounce in the U.S. 10-year yield over the past couple of days may have also provided some relief. Indeed, Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) technical analysts note that extreme momentum has pushed the monthly Relative Strength Index (RSI) of the U.S. 10- and 30-year bonds into their fourth and fifth-most overbought level ever. This may signal an imminent “key low” or “pivot low.”
And not all is bad about negative yields anyway. The more bond yields move deep into negative territory, the more stocks are seen by many as the only attractive asset. Why buy a bond on which you’re guaranteed to lose money while you can buy stocks with lofty dividend yields of 5% or more?
True, if held until maturity, government bond yields don’t look appealing. But on an absolute-return basis, some long-duration securities beat stocks. Notably this year, Austria’s 100-year note has delivered investors as much as an 80% return so far. Granted, the timing must be right and liquidity could be an issue.
Finally, let’s not forget about another silver lining. With Germany facing the danger of a recession, the government has signaled it stands ready to inject stimulus if things turn sour. Since the bund curve has turned negative across all maturities, financing those fiscal measures in the long-term is even more appealing.
In the meantime, Euro Stoxx 50 futures are trading little changed ahead of the open, while S&P 500 contracts are up 0.2%.
SECTORS IN FOCUS TODAY:

The stock soared almost 7% once trading started in the Danish capital, its biggest gain since May. The Stoxx Europe 600 index was little changed.
“With no negative surprises in these results and relative to weak share price performance and bearish investor positioning, the shares may see some short-term relief,” RBC Capital Markets said in a note.
Earnings before interest, tax and costs related to Pandora’s restructuring program, fell 15% to 1.08 billion kroner ($160 million) in the second quarter, Pandora said on Tuesday. That beat the average estimate of 996 million kroner in a Bloomberg survey of five analysts. The company said it needs to expand its inventory buyback program as part of “additional important restructuring initiatives to improve the structural health of the business,” which will cost an extra 500 million kroner.
“As expected, the financial results continued to be weak and impacted by the commercial reset” that’s part of the new strategy, dubbed Program Now, Pandora said in a statement. The company reiterated its guidance for the full year and said it sees “early positive signs of the impact” of the new strategy, which “is visible in the underlying gross margin, cost levels and cash generation.”
The report was the first under Chief Executive Officer Alexander Lacik, who joined in April following a string of departures from Pandora’s top management. He’s under pressure to deliver on a strategy that was formulated before he joined.
Pandora has been hurt by fading consumer interest in its charms and bracelets and the company has also taken a hit from a decline in retail sales at shopping malls. The stock has lost more than 75% of its value since a 2016 peak and is heading for a third consecutive year of losses on the Copenhagen stock exchange.

Campbell said markets could be holding off until the Jackson Hole Symposium on Thursday where there will be concrete comments from U.S. Federal Reserve Chief Jerome Powell and European Central Bank head Mario Draghi.
Investors will also keep an eye out for minutes from the latest policy meetings of both the Fed and the ECB later this week.
 Pandora  A/S (CO:PNDORA) jumped 6.6% to the top of the STOXX 600 index on Tuesday after the Danish jewelry maker maintained its full-year guidance. However, a fall in bank shares (SX7P) and miners (SXPP) capped gains.

SEOUL (Reuters) - Japan has approved shipments of a high-tech material to South Korea for the second time since imposing export curbs last month, two sources said, ahead of talks by government officials this week to resolve a dispute stemming from their wartime past.
Relations between the two U.S. allies worsened late last year when a South Korean court ordered Japanese companies to compensate some of their former laborers forced by the firms to work during World War Two.
In early July, Japan tightened controls on shipments to South Korea of three materials used in chips and displays, threatening to disrupt the global tech supply chain. Japan also announced a plan to remove South Korea's fast-track export status from later this month.
The material cleared for Japan's exports to  Samsung Electronics Co Ltd  (KS:005930) in South Korea is photoresists, which are crucial for the tech giant's advanced contract chipmaking production, the people who were familiar with the matter said on Tuesday.
A Samsung Electronics spokeswoman and a South Korean trade ministry spokeswoman declined to comment. A Japanese official in charge of the issue was not available for comment. 
An official at South Korea's presidential office confirmed the exports at a briefing, but said that ""uncertainties"" will remain until Japan completely removes the tighter export controls it has instituted.
""Tokyo's latest export approval is positive for the local industry, but I don't see Japan's move as a conciliatory message to South Korea,"" another South Korean government official told Reuters, requesting anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter. 
Earlier this month, Japan gave the green light to the export of photoresists to Samsung Electronics for the first time since it imposed the restrictions.
Samsung Electronics shares ended up 1.95% on Tuesday, leading the wider market's (KS11) gain of 1.05%.
CARBON FIBER 
Japan's latest move comes ahead a meeting between Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Kono and his South Korean counterpart, Kang Kyung-wha, in Beijing on Wednesday. 
""This is a signal that Japan would not further escalate tensions. This is positive in that it creates an atmosphere for talks,"" said Ahn Duk-geun, a international studies professor at Seoul National University. 
But he said he does not expect a breakthrough in the stalemate, citing wide differences over how to resolve forced labor issue between the two neighboring countries. ""I hope there will at least be a handshake,"" Ahn said. 
“We will have to actively express our position, but it is a very difficult (situation),"" Kang said at an airport in Seoul on Tuesday before leaving for Beijing.
Separately, South Korean President Moon Jae-in pledged to nurture the local carbon fiber industry, as part of efforts to reduce dependence on Japan imports for high-tech materials. 
Moon attended an event by South Korean firm  Hyosung Advanced Materials  (KS:298050) to announce a total of 1 trillion won ($828.55 million) investment by 2028 in expanding production of carbon fiber, one of the items potentially subject to tighter export controls and used to make parts of hydrogen cars and aircrafts. 

Currently, South Korean firms rely on Japan's Toray Industries (T:3402) and others for carbon fiber supplies, industry officials say.

1660,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 20, 2019 03:07AM ET</span>","China's Baidu beats earnings expectations, shares rally","By Yingzhi Yang and Ayanti Bera
(Reuters) - Chinese internet search giant Baidu Inc (NASDAQ:BIDU) beat quarterly earnings estimates on Monday after signing more people up to its video streaming service, sending its shares higher in a relief rally.
Baidu reported a small 1% bump in revenue and a 62% drop in net profit for the second quarter, but the result was welcomed by investors who had feared worse amid a slowing Chinese economy and stiff competition from rivals like ByteDance's TikTok.
Baidu's earnings update followed reports from  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) and JD.com last week, which also beat expectations, showing how some tech giants' diversification strategies might be helping stave off macroeconomic pressures.
Baidu's video streaming service iQiyi was a key driver of the revenue bump as it crossed the 100 million subscriber mark in June, although there were some concerns about rising costs at the unit associated with winning and retaining viewers.
Baidu's total revenue for the three months to the end of June rose to 26.33 billion yuan ($3.7 billion) from 25.97 billion yuan a year earlier, beating a forecast 25.77 billion yuan, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Baidu earned 10.11 yuan per American depositary share, compared with expectations of 6.12 yuan per ADS.
""It makes sense that Baidu beats the estimates because analysts have lowered their expectations to the minimum,"" said Connie Gu, an analyst at BOCOM International, adding the market would need to see better-than-expected results for several consecutive quarters for more sustained confidence.
Baidu's Nasdaq-listed shares rose over 9% in after-hours trading. The stock has plummeted more than 50% over the past year.
But there were some red flags at separately listed Netflix-like iQiyi, where shares tumbled by the same magnitude after a 20% jump in costs as the company spent more on content to entice subscribers undercut a 15% rise in revenue to 7.11 billion yuan.
STRUCTURAL PRESSURE
Baidu, whose search engine dominates the market in China, has been under pressure as factors such as U.S.-China trade tensions and tougher government regulation weighed on key revenue contributors like advertising.
Analysts said Baidu faced a longer-term structural problem, especially with the rise of new media platforms seeking to lure away subscribers.
""Competition from recently rising large-traffic platforms is becoming more and more fierce, with advertisers shifting budget to those platforms,"" said Natalie Wu, an analyst at China International Capital Corporation.
While Baidu has been expanding into other business lines such as cloud services and mini programs within its Baidu App, most of its success so far has been at iQiyi.
Revenues at its core search-engine business dipped 2% during the quarter, while Baidu's net income more than halved to 2.4 billion yuan.
Baidu Chief Executive Robin Li warned employees in an internal letter on Tuesday that ""severe external challenges and a weak macro environment"" necessitated changes to the company's personnel and business strategy.
""These changes will bring pain in phases, but will also bring positive and far-reaching effects, to allow Baidu to walk on more steadily and for longer,"" he said in the letter seen by Reuters.
The company said no job cuts were planned when questioned about the personnel restructure."

That was a sharp improvement from the 27% drop in June.
Overall exports by the sector rose 4.3% to 1.9 billion Swiss francs ($1.94 billion) in July.
One of the world's most popular shopping destinations, Hong Kong is on the verge of its first recession in a decade as mass demonstrations scare off tourists and bite into retail sales.

The Asian financial center that reverted from British to Chinese rule in 1997 is the biggest foreign market for Swiss timepieces, absorbing 13.5% of the exports by value in July.
The U.S. market had a 10.1% share and China 8.0%, Federation of the Swiss Watch Industry data showed on Tuesday.
Vontobel analyst Rene Weber said in a note last week that Hong Kong was one of the most important market for Swiss watchmakers Swatch Group (S:UHR) and  Richemont  (S:CFR), representing about 11% of their sales.
Kepler Cheuvreux's Jon Cox said he had cut growth assumptions for this year and next. He also reduced earnings per share estimates for Swatch Group by 6% and for Richemont by 4% over the next two to three years.

The new asset sales will come on top of Casino's existing plan to sell off 2.5 billion euros of assets by the first quarter of 2020. Of that target Casino has already signed agreements for sales worth 2.1 billion euros.
The sales so far have mainly taken the form of the disposal of non-core supermarkets or property assets to private equity investors.

1664,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 20, 2019 02:21AM ET</span>",Climate change could rain on Saudi Aramco's IPO parade,"By Clara Denina , Sinead Cruise, Rania El Gamal and Simon Jessop
LONDON/DUBAI (Reuters) - Saudi Aramco's biggest asset could also be a liability.
The state energy giant's vast oil reserves – it can sustain current production levels for the next 50 years – make it more exposed than any other company to a rising tide of environmental activism and shift away from fossil fuels.
In the three years since Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman first proposed a stock market listing, climate change and new green technologies are putting some investors, particularly in Europe and the United States, off the oil and gas sector.
Sustainable investments account for more than a quarter of all assets under management globally, by some estimates.
Aramco, for its part, argues oil and gas will remain at the heart of the energy mix for decades, saying renewables and nuclear cannot meet rising global demand, and that its crude production has lower greenhouse gas emissions than its rivals.
But with the company talking again to banks about an initial public offering (IPO), some investors and lawyers say the window to execute a sale at a juicy price is shrinking and Aramco will need to explain to prospective shareholders how it plans to profit in a lower-carbon world.
""Saudi Aramco is a really interesting test as to whether the market is getting serious about pricing in energy transition risk,"" said Natasha Landell-Mills, in charge of integrating environment, social and governance (ESG) considerations into investing at London-based asset manager Sarasin & Partners.
""The longer that (the IPO) gets delayed, the less willing the market will be to price it favorably because gradually investors are going to need to ask questions about how valuable those reserves are in a world that is trying to get down to net zero emissions by 2050.""
Reuters reported on Aug. 8 that Prince Mohammed was insisting on a $2 trillion valuation even though some bankers and company insiders say the kingdom should trim its target to around $1.5 trillion.
A valuation gap could hinder any share sale. The IPO was previously slated for 2017 or 2018 and, when that deadline slipped, to 2020-2021.
Aramco told Reuters it was ready for a listing and the timing would be decided by the government.
The company also said it was investing in research to make cars more efficient, and working on new technologies to use hydrogen in cars, convert more crude to chemicals and capture CO2 which can be injected in its reservoirs to improve extraction of oil.
SELLING THE STORY
Some would argue this is not enough.
A growing number of investors across the world are factoring ESG risk into their decision-making, although the degree to which that would stop them investing in Aramco varies wildly.
Some would exclude the company on principle because of its carbon output, while others would be prepared to buy if the price was cheap enough to outweigh the perceived ESG risk - especially given oil companies often pay healthy dividends.
Graphic: Oil still keeping income investors sweet - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/ARAMCO-IPO-ESG/0H001QEPF7T7/index.html
At a $1.5 trillion valuation, Aramco would be the world's largest public company. If it were included in major equity indices it would automatically be bought by passive investment funds that track them, regardless of their ESG credentials.
And as the world's most profitable company, Aramco shares would be snapped up by many active investors.
Talks about a share sale were revived this year after Aramco attracted huge investor demand for its first international bond issue. In its bond prospectus, it said climate change could potentially have a ""material adverse effect"" on its business.
When it comes to an IPO, equity investors require more information about potential risks and how companies plan to deal with them, as they are more exposed than bondholders if a business runs into trouble.
""Companies need to lead with the answers in the prospectus, rather than have two or three paragraphs describing potential risks from environmental issues,"" said Nick O'Donnell, partner in the corporate department at law firm Baker McKenzie.
""An oil and gas company needs to be thinking about how to explain the story over the next 20 years and bring it out into a separate section rather than hiding it away in the prospectus, it needs to use it as a selling tool. And also, once the IPO is done, every annual report should have a standalone ESG section.""
Unlike other major oil companies, Aramco doesn't have a separate report laying out how it addresses ESG issues such as labor practices and resource scarcity, while it does not publish the carbon emissions from products it sells. Until this year's bond issue, it also kept its finances under wraps.
The company does however have an Environmental Protection Department, sponsors sustainability initiatives and is a founding member of the Oil and Gas Climate Initiative, which is led by 13 top energy companies and aims to cut emissions of methane, a potent greenhouse gas.
On Aug. 12 Aramco published information on the intensity of its hydrocarbon mix for the first time. It disclosed the amount of greenhouse gases from each barrel it produces.
Aramco's senior vice president of finance Khalid al-Dabbagh said during an earnings call this month that its carbon emissions from ""upstream"" exploration and production were the lowest among its peers.
A study published by Science magazine last year found carbon emissions from Saudi Arabia's crude production were the world's second lowest after Denmark, as a result of having a small number of highly productive oilfields.
THE OIL PRICE
Aramco says that, with the global economy forecast to double in size by 2050, oil and gas will remain essential.
""Saudi Aramco is determined to not only meet the world's growing demand for ample, reliable and affordable energy but to meet the world's growing demand for much cleaner fuel,"" it told Reuters.
""Alternatives are still facing significant technological, economic and infrastructure hurdles, and the history of past energy transitions shows that these developments take time.""
The company has also moved to diversify into gas and chemicals and is using renewable energy in its facilities.
But Aramco still, ultimately, represents a bet on the price of oil.
It generated net income of $111 billion in 2018, over a third more than the combined total of the five ""super-majors"" ExxonMobil (N:XOM), Royal Dutch Shell (AS:RDSa),  BP  (L:BP),  Chevron  (N:CVX) and  Total  (PA:TOTF).
In 2016, when the oil price hit 13-year lows, Aramco's net income was only $13 billion, according to its bond prospectus where it unveiled its finances for the first time, based on current exchange rates. Its earnings fell 12% in the first half of 2019, mainly on lower oil prices.
Concerns about future demand for fossil fuels have weighed on the sector. Since 2016, when Prince Mohammed first flagged an IPO, the 12-months forward price to earnings ratio of five of the world's top listed oil companies has fallen to 12 from 21 on average, according to Reuters calculations, lagging the FTSE 100 and the STOXX Europe 600 Oil & Gas index averages.

AN INFLUX OF CAPITAL
Using a broad measure, there was global sustainable investment of $30.1 trillion across the world's five major markets at the end of 2018, according to the Global Sustainable Investment Review http://www.gsi-alliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/GSIR_Review2018F.pdf, more than a quarter of all assets under management globally. That compares with $22.8 trillion in 2016.

GRAPHIC: 'Sustainable' investing fund launches - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/ARAMCO-IPO-ESG/0H001QEPB7SV/index.html
""Given the influx of capital into the ESG space, Aramco's IPO would have been better off going public 5-10 years ago,"" said Joseph di Virgilio, global equities portfolio manager at New York-based Romulus Asset Management, which has $900 million in assets under management.
""An IPO today would still be the largest of its kind, but many asset managers focusing solely on ESG may not participate.""
The world's top listed oil and gas companies have come under heavy pressure from investors and climate groups in recent years to outline strategies to reduce their carbon footprint.
Shell, BP and others have agreed, together with shareholders, on carbon reduction targets for some of operations and to increase spending on renewable energies. U.S. major ExxonMobil, the world's top publicly traded oil and gas company, has resisted adopting targets.
Britain's biggest asset manager LGIM removed Exxon from its 5 billion pounds ($6.3 billion) Future World funds for what it said was a failure to confront threats posed by climate change. LGIM did not respond to a request for comment on whether it would buy shares in Aramco's potential IPO.
Sarasin & Partners said in July it had sold nearly 20% of its holdings in Shell, saying its spending plans were out of sync with international targets to battle climate change. The rest of the stake is under review.
The asset manager, which has nearly 14 billion pounds in assets under management, didn't participate in Aramco's bond offering and Landell-Mills said they would be unlikely to invest in any IPO."

1666,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 19, 2019 09:44PM ET</span>",Judge dismisses turnaround guru's racketeering case vs McKinsey,"By Tom Hals
WILMINGTON, Del. (Reuters) - A federal judge dismissed claims on Monday by turnaround pioneer Jay Alix that McKinsey & Co violated racketeering laws when the consulting firm expanded into advising bankrupt U.S. companies.
Alix accused the consulting firm, known for its secrecy, of improperly concealing potential conflicts when it sought bankruptcy court approval to advise companies in Chapter 11. 
The decision is part of a larger battle between McKinsey and Alix that has been waged since at least 2016 across multiple courts. Alix has said he is fighting for the integrity of the bankruptcy system, while McKinsey has said Alix is using the courts to try to stifle competition. 
Alix said that McKinsey's bankruptcy work was a ""criminal enterprise"" that generated an unlawful profit of at least $101 million, at the expense of AlixPartners, the firm Alix founded.
In Monday's ruling, U.S. Judge Jesse Furman of Manhattan dismissed claims brought under a racketeering law known as RICO that McKinsey had harmed AlixPartners.
""In sum, the link between McKinsey’s allegedly unlawful conduct and AlixPartners’ alleged injury is too remote, contingent, and indirect to sustain a RICO claim,"" wrote Furman. 
The judge asked for further briefing on three other claims brought under state law, including allegations that McKinsey failed to exit the restructuring business as promised by the head of the firm in a private meeting with Alix.
While Alix has retired from AlixPartners, he still held a 35% stake when he sued McKinsey in May 2018, according to court documents.
Jay Alix noted in a statement that Furman did not rule on the merits and said he would continue to pursue similar allegations in the bankruptcy case of Westmoreland Coal Co. ""McKinsey’s contention that its disclosures in bankruptcy cases always have complied with the law is not credible,"" Alix said.
A McKinsey spokesman said in a statement that ""we are pleased that a court has yet again found Alix’s use of the court system to further his own agenda to be legally invalid.""
McKinsey expanded in 2010 into bankruptcy consulting, which had been dominated by AlixPartners, Alvarez & Marsal and FTI Consulting.
Lawyers and other professionals seeking to work for a bankrupt company are required to disclose their connections to the company, its creditors and any other party in interest in a Chapter 11 case. 
Their application is reviewed by the U.S. Trustee, a bankruptcy watchdog within the Department of Justice, and must be approved by a bankruptcy judge.
In the federal lawsuit, Alix alleged that McKinsey, the world's largest consulting firm, hid ties to lenders and competitors in numerous bankruptcy cases, including those of American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) and coal producer Alpha Natural Resources [ALPHR.UL].

Furman said the U.S. Trustee was better placed to pursue Alix's allegations and noted that the watchdog has done so - reaching a $15 million settlement with McKinsey earlier this year to resolve incomplete disclosures.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Co reinforced its defense of its accounting practices on Monday after investors asked more questions about an unusual research report last week that accused the jet engine and power plant maker of financial fraud.
The 175-page report https://www.gefraud.com, published on Thursday by Harry Markopolos, who blew the whistle on Bernard Madoff's Ponzi scheme, renewed concern about GE's finances and sent its stock tumbling.
""Some of (the) questions I've been receiving go straight to the heart of GE's culture, so let me be clear: we operate with absolute integrity and stand behind our financial reporting,"" Steve Winoker, GE's investor relations chief, said in a statement on Monday.
Investors are nervous about GE because the Boston-based conglomerate is expected to lose as much as $1 billion in cash this year, has slashed its dividend and profit forecast and taken more than $40 billion in charges and write-offs in recent years.
Among the biggest shocks to investors, GE said in 2017 that it would set aside $15 billion for long-term care insurance payouts, one of the largest such amounts ever.
GRAPHIC: GE's Long-Term Plan - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/GE-INSURANCE/0H001PBFP52D/index.html
Markopolos said GE would need to put aside an additional $29 billion for insurance losses, and that it had improperly counted profit from oil and gas services subsidiary Baker Hughes.
A Reuters article in March found that GE's reserves were then in line with other insurers, but some experts said GE would need to set aside $12 billion more because its estimates relied on optimistic assumptions.
GE's shares fell as much as 15% after Markopolos' report came out, recouping much of the decline on Friday. On Monday, GE shares were down 1.4% at $8.67 in afternoon trading.
In response to the concerns about insurance, Winoker said on Monday that the amount of GE's long-term care payouts would be determined ""over decades, not years,"" and that GE uses ""rigorous testing,"" ""sound actuarial analysis"" and follows ""regulatory and accounting"" rules.
Addressing the Baker Hughes questions, Winoker said accounting rules require GE to include the subsidiary's results in its earnings reports because it is the majority shareholder.
GE disclosed in 2018 that its accounting was being investigated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the Department of Justice. It also is the subject of a class-action shareholder lawsuit that alleges fraud in GE's insurance and other accounting.
Winoker, who covered GE as an analyst at UBS before taking his current job in January, said investors' questions about Markopolos' report prompted GE to comment on Monday, but did not say how many questions GE received or characterize them.
SHORT PROFITS
Markopolos said in the report that he stood to share in profits from a hedge fund that sold GE shares short before the report came out, a bet that the share price would fall.
Short sales of GE shares rose by about $995 million in the month before Markopolos' report came out, according to S3 Partners, a New York financial analytics firm.
GE Chief Executive Officer Larry Culp said last week that Markopolos' report was ""market manipulation - pure and simple"" - a reference to Markopolos' potential to profit from short-selling timed to the report.
Culp and Leslie Seidman, chair of GE's audit committee, said Markopolos did not talk with GE before issuing his report. GE said Culp, Seidman and other GE directors and executives bought shares after the report came out.
GE said in the statement on Monday that it has not under-provisioned for long-term care insurance, which pays for assisted living and nursing home care for policy holders. Such policies have pushed some insurers into financial trouble, and even bankruptcy, because the costs have turned out to be much higher than were assumed when the policies were written in the late 1990s and early 2000s.
GE is now only a reinsurer of such coverage and says it has not written new long-term care policies since 2006.
Markopolos' report said GE needs to add $18.5 billion to reserves now because it has underestimated its potential claims, and will need to add a further $10.5 billion when new accounting rules take effect in 2021 or 2022.
Regarding Baker Hughes, GE said on Monday that the company's assets and income are correctly included in GE's financial reports because GE owns 50.2%, down from 50.4% last year.
Markopolos said GE is double-counting because it does not in practice direct activities at Baker Hughes."
1668,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 19, 2019 07:11PM ET</span>",Japan Inc backs Abe's tough trade stance vs South Korea amid row: Reuters poll,"By Tetsushi Kajimoto
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese companies broadly support Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's tough trade stance against South Korea, a Reuters poll found.
Three-quarters of companies in the monthly Reuters Corporate Survey approved of Abe's explanations for curbing exports to South Korea of materials used to make computer chips.
More than nine in 10 predicted Japan would win if Seoul takes its complaints to the World Trade Organisation (WTO).
The acrimonious trade dispute between the Japan and South Korea, two U.S. allies, grew out of a row over wartime forced labor.
Abe last month tightened curbs on exports to South Korea of three high-tech materials needed to make memory chips and display panels. The government this month canceled South Korea's fast-track trade status.
Removing South Korea from a ""white-list"" of favored export destinations means some Japanese exporters face more paperwork and on-site inspections before they can win permits, which could slow Korea-bound exports for a wide range of goods.
In the survey, companies were split on whether the trade curbs will affect the Japanese economy. Some companies said they won't be affected as they don't directly engage in business with South Korea.
Those seeing an impact from the export curbs expressed concerns including the global slowdown and spreading trade frictions, worsening Japan-South Korea ties, weaker corporate profits and long-term competitiveness of their firms.
""As we stand on the brink of a recession amid U.S.-China trade frictions, it's undesirable to take such steps that could accelerate the downtrend,"" a manager at a wholesale firm wrote in a survey response.
Others disagreed.
""It's obvious that the Moon (Jae-in) administration is putting its utmost priority on reconciliation with North Korea at a time when North Korea proceeds with nuclear development,"" wrote a manger at an electric machinery maker. ""It's only natural to deprive South Korea of most-favored-nation status.""
In opinion polls last month, the liberal Asahi newspaper found 56% of the public felt Abe's trade moves were ""reasonable"", while the conservative Yomiuri found 71% supported the measures.
Seoul sees the export curbs as retaliation over a dispute about wartime forced labor, while Tokyo cited unspecified security reasons.
Asked how they evaluate Japanese government's explanation for its export curbs against South Korea, about three-quarters of companies in the Reuters poll said it has been explained fully or to a degree.
The survey, conducted July 31-Aug. 14 for Reuters by Nikkei Research, canvassed 504 midsize and large Japanese manufacturers and non-manufacturers. Managers respond to the survey on condition of anonymity to voice their opinions more freely.
FORCED LABOR DISPUTE
A fresh dispute over wartime forced labor was triggered last year when a South Korean court ordered Japanese firms to compensate some of their former laborers. The dispute brought bilateral ties to their lowest point in decades.
Japan argues the issue was settled by a 1965 treaty normalizing bilateral ties. South Korean President Moon said on Friday that Seoul would be open to dialogue with Tokyo as needed, in a carefully choreographed message at his address marking Korea's independence from Japan's 1910-45 colonial rule.
If South Korea brings its complaints against Japan's export curbs to the WTO, an overwhelming 94% of companies in the Reuters poll said Japan would win.
""Japan's argument stands to reason. No other country including the United States is siding with South Korea,"" one manager wrote.
""Still, Japan needs to lobby hard to win the backing of other countries,"" the manager said, given that South Korea in April won the bulk of its appeal in a dispute at the WTO over import bans and testing requirements it imposed on Japanese seafood."
1669,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 19, 2019 05:34PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch,"Investing.com – Here’s a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow.
1. Home Depot to Hammer out Earnings
  Home Depot   (NYSE:HD) is set to release earnings before the opening bell Tuesday. 
Ahead of the report, analysts have weighed the impact of tariffs, which has increased raw materials costs such as lumber, against supportive factors such as lower mortgage rates and a healthy consumer. 
“(W)e are concerned somewhat that seemingly transitory factors might have impacted modestly sales trends, particularly early in the period (second quarter),” Oppenheimer said. 
But the underlying drivers “appear to remain in place, and could re-strengthen, given a recent plunge in mortgage rates, moderating, albeit still climbing home values, and overall healthy consumer indicators,” it added, 
Home Depot is expected to report earnings of $3.09 per share on revenue of $31.06 billion.
As well as earnings, guidance will also draw close scrutiny after the home-improvement retailer’s previous outlook in the first quarter fell short of expectations.
 Home Depot  (NYSE:HD) shares are up 2.75% in August and 21% on the year.
Rival Lowe’s (NYSE:LOW) reports earnings a day later on Wednesday.
2. Fed Vice Chairman Quarles in Spotlight 
The economic data slate for Tuesday is light, with a speech from Federal Reserve Vice Chairman Randal Quarles due at 1 PM ET (17:00 GMT). 
Quarles speaks Tuesday at an event in Utah on community development. 
The speech comes ahead of the minutes of the July 30-31 Federal Open Market Committee meeting scheduled for Wednesday and Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell speech in Jackson Hole, Wyo., on Friday.
The minutes, due Wednesday, will likely be parsed for signs that Fed members are increasingly leaning more dovish, raising the odds of a rate cut at their meeting next month.
3. API Crude Inventories 
The American Petroleum Institute's petroleum data, due Tuesday afternoon, will be viewed with interest after the previous report, which often serves as an indicator of the contents of the U.S. Energy Department’s report due Wednesday, showed a draw in crude stockpiles for the eighth-straight week. 
U.S. Crude started the week on the front foot on Monday, with the September contract rising 2.4% to settle at $56.21. The rally was based expectations that central banks stand ready to deploy further stimulus in an effort to avert a global recession, which would hurt oil-demand growth."
1670,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 19, 2019 05:26PM ET</span>",Wall Street rallies on hopes of global economic stimulus,"By April Joyner
NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks climbed on Monday as reports of stimulus efforts in China and Germany calmed fears of a severe downturn in the global economy that were stoked last week as bond yields fell.
The benchmark S&P 500 has recovered most of its losses following Wednesday's brief inversion of the yield curve between 2-year and 10-year Treasuries, commonly viewed as an indicator of a recession within the next two years. After falling nearly 3% on Wednesday, the S&P 500 has risen for the last three sessions.
China's central bank unveiled a key interest rate reform on Saturday to help steer borrowing costs lower for companies. On Sunday, German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz suggested that Berlin could make available up to 50 billion euros ($55 billion) of extra spending.
""Those are positive stories, and it's fostered a risk-on environment that has persisted throughout the day,"" said Michael O'Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading in Greenwich, Connecticut. ""Investors are glad to see that countries are recognizing the risks out there.""
After the market close, the Washington Post reported that White House officials have discussed the possibility of a temporary payroll tax cut to spur the U.S. economy, joining other global economic stimulus efforts.
Stocks also received a boost as Washington extended by 90 days the window during which China's Huawei Technologies, blacklisted by the U.S. government in May, can buy components from U.S. companies to supply existing customers.
Shares of Apple Inc (O:AAPL) rose 1.9% to provide the biggest boost to the Nasdaq and the second-largest boost to the S&P 500 and the Dow. President Donald Trump said on Sunday that he had spoken with Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook, who ""made a good case"" that tariffs could hurt Apple.
The S&P 500 technology index rose 1.6%, while the Philadelphia semiconductor index (SOX) rose 1.9%.
""You're really seeing some of the trade-sensitive names doing better,"" said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer of Independent Advisor Alliance in Charlotte, North Carolina. ""It's put a boost under risk assets today.""
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) rose 249.78 points, or 0.96%, to 26,135.79, the S&P 500 (SPX) gained 34.97 points, or 1.21%, to 2,923.65 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) added 106.82 points, or 1.35%, to 8,002.81.
All of the 11 major S&P sectors were higher. Energy shares (SPNY), which rose 2.1% as oil prices advanced, led S&P sectors in percentage gains. Reflecting Monday's risk-on sentiment, defensive sectors such as real estate <.SPLRCR> and utilities (SPLRCU) lagged the broader index in percentage gains.
Given concerns about economic growth, investors have looked closely for cues from the Federal Reserve on monetary policy. In July, the U.S. central bank cut interest rates for the first time in more than a decade.
Wednesday's release of minutes from the Fed's July policy meeting, as well as Chair Jerome Powell's speech at the Jackson Hole symposium on Friday, might provide indications on whether the central bank will cut rates further, investors said.
Shares of  Estee Lauder  Cos Inc (N:EL) jumped 12.5% to a record high as the beauty company forecast full-year revenue and profit above estimates, bolstered by booming demand for its premium skincare products in the Asia-Pacific region.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 2.81-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.45-to-1 ratio favored advancers.
The S&P 500 posted 57 new 52-week highs and one new low; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 78 new highs and 60 new lows.

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 6.28 billion shares, compared to the 7.58 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

1673,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 19, 2019 05:25PM ET</span>",Stocks - S&P Surges as Trade Tensions and Recession Fears Fade,"Investing.com - Stocks surged for a third-straight day on optimism about a U.S.- China trade deal and fewer worries about a recession hitting any time soon.
With Monday's rally, the major averages have recovered most of the losses suffered in last week's wild gyrations.
The S&P 500 was up 1.2%, and the Dow Jones industrials rose nearly 1%. The Nasdaq Composite jumped 1.35% and moved above 8,000 for the first time in four sessions.
Chip stocks led technology shares higher after the Trump Administration extended its reprieve on penalties for doing business with Huawei, the Chinese telecommunications equipment company. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index rose nearly 1.9%. Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) were the leaders.
That was about the only real news on the China-U.S. trade fight, but it was good enough.
Twenty-eight of the 30 Dow stocks were higher, led by Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) and chemical maker Dow Inc (NYSE:DOW). At their highs in the morning, the blue chips were up as many as 336 points.
The tech-dominated Nasdaq 100 index, up 115 points, or 1.52%, was led by Chinese internet retailer Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU), Nvidia and Wynn Resorts (NASDAQ:WYNN), one of the biggest players in Macau. 
 
 
In addition, oil prices moved higher on hopes that any kind of deal could boost oil demand. West Texas Intermediate crude was up $1.33 to $56.14 a barrel on Monday. Brent  crude, the global benchmark, was up $1.10 to $59.74. WTI is still down more than 15% from its $66.30 peak in April. 
The demand for stocks pulled interest rates higher, with the 10-Year Treasury yield rising 4.4% to 1.608%, its highest level since Aug. 13. The 2-Year Treasury yield rose to 1.549%.
Since Wednesday's shocking selloff that saw the Dow fall about 800 points, the blue-chip index is up 2.6%. The S&P 500 has rebounded 2.92% and the Nasdaq Composite has risen 2.94%. 
Volatility has dominated markets as the worries have intensified about the economic impact of the U.S.-China trade battle. It has affected business in both countries. Electronics companies have become especially vulnerable to the shifting political winds. U.S. farmers have been stressed because China has been their largest export market. While the two sides are starting to communicate, no deal is expected until next year at the earliest. 
In the 14 trading days so far in August, the Dow has experienced nine days with gains or losses of at least 239 points. The S&P 500 has moved up or down 1% or more on eight occasions and the Nasdaq has seen eight days of 100-point gains or losses. 
There is plenty of opportunity for more volatility over the next four weeks with earnings reports expected from   Home Depot   (NYSE:HD), Kohl's (NYSE:KSS), Lowe’s (NYSE:LOW),   Target   (NYSE:TGT), Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN) and Dick’s Sporting Goods (NYSE:DKS).
There will also be minutes from the Federal Reserve's July meeting due Wednesday and every word uttered at the Fed's annual retreat in Jackson Hole. Wyo., will be scrutinized. All of this will lead up to the Fed's September meeting when the central bank is expected to trim its key federal funds rate.
While bond markets have been signaling the potential of a recession in the next year or two, it's not clear if consumers are paying much attention. 
Lastly, watch to see if the major averages can hit new highs. So far, new highs in the last two years have been met by near-immediate selloffs.
Winners and Losers in the S&P 500
  Estee Lauder   (NYSE:EL), Nvidia and Wynn were among the top S&P 500 performers on Monday.
  Alliance Data Systems   (NYSE:ADS), which organizes concepts like brand-centric bank credit card programs, health insurer DaVita HealthCare Partners (NYSE:DVA) and troubled conglomerate   General Electric   (NYSE:GE) were among the worst-performing stocks."
1674,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 19, 2019 04:55PM ET</span>",Nigerian President Asks Tax Agency to Explain Missed Targets,"(Bloomberg) -- Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari asked the Federal Inland Revenue Service to explain its failure to meet tax-collection targets since 2015, after persistent shortfalls.
Nigerian presidential spokesman Garba Shehu confirmed in an emailed statement that the government has sought explanations for the shortfalls from FIRS chairman Babatunde Fowler as reported by several news media on Monday.
“It would appear that the country might be heading for a fiscal crisis if urgent steps are not taken to halt the negative trends in target setting and target realization in tax revenue,” Shehu said.
The government has repeatedly missed its revenue targets since Buhari was first elected to office in 2015, as the output and price of crude, the country’s main export, declined. The administration has sought to boost tax revenue with limited success in a country of more than 200 million people with a tax-to-gross-domestic-product ratio of 6%. That compares with 24.7% for South Africa, with which it vies to be Africa’s biggest economy.
To make up for lost income, Nigeria increased its borrowing in recent years, leaving it with a debt-service burden that consumes more than 70% of its revenue, according to the Finance Ministry."
1675,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 19, 2019 03:26PM ET</span>",Who is next in big pharma's merger spree?,"(Reuters) - Consolidation in the U.S. healthcare industry, which has already witnessed a string of multi-billion dollar deals, is expected to remain a major theme for the rest of 2019.
Bristol-Myers Squibb's $74 billion acquisition of Celgene (NASDAQ:CELG) set the M&A ball rolling in January, and was followed by AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV) Inc's $63 billion bid for troubled smaller rival Allergan (NYSE:AGN) Plc.
Regulators are pressuring companies to cut drug costs and takeovers have become the preferred method of combating looming patent expiries on some of the top-selling medicines they have relied upon in recent years.
Following is a list of big healthcare companies and their recent deals and possible future acquisitions.
BIOGEN INC:
** Since the halt in its development of a promising Alzheimer's therapy wiped $18 billion off Biogen's stock in March, Wall Street has been calling on the company to beef up its drug development pipeline through acquisitions.
** Possible deals would give the company access to drugs for lucrative therapeutic areas such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy and depression.
** Recent deal was the $877 million buyout of gene therapy developer Nightstar Therapeutics, and as of June 30 the company still had cash reserves of almost $2 billion.
ELI LILLY AND CO :
** Lilly spun off its animal health unit earlier this year, and has reiterated its commitment to making bolt-on acquisitions to diversify its portfolio, as its long-term top-sellers Humalog and Cialis face intensifying competition.
** Company has also been focusing on cancer drug development and its $8 billion buyout of Loxo Oncology helped it delve deeper into the lucrative business.
** The company reported $2.29 billion in cash and cash equivalents as of June 30.
PFIZER INC:
** The world's largest drugmaker has repeatedly said it would steer clear of large scale M&A, citing confidence in its own drug pipeline. But in April it said it would look at bolt-on deals worth ""a few"" billion dollars to complement its pipeline
** The spin-off and merger of its consumer healthcare unit with GlaxoSmithKline Plc, as well as its off-patent branded drugs business has simplified the company's business structure.
** Analysts say that may still leave room for smaller deals like its $10.6 billion buy of Array Biopharma, which boosted its arsenal of oncology drugs and set the stage for the company to become a leader in colon cancer treatments.
** Shares of the company are down 20.6% so far this year.
AMGEN INC :
** A recent U.S. court ruling win on Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN) patents for rheumatoid arthritis drug Enbrel is seen as having left the company free to pursue business development plans, including M&A.
** The drugmaker said previously it would look for both big and small deals to push deeper into areas like cancer and metabolic disorders, where it already has a firm footing.
** Analysts have also suggested buying Celgene Corp's psoriasis drug Otezla, which Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY) Co is looking to sell in order to allay antitrust concerns.
** Amgen had $5.53 billion in cash and cash equivalents as of June 30. Shares of the company are up nearly 5% this year.
MERCK & CO INC:
** Investors have raised concerns about Merck's increasing dependence on blockbuster cancer drug Keytruda, highlighting the need for the drugmaker to engage in M&A.
** The company has said it would focus on bolt-on deals rather than a large, transformative acquisition.
** War chest stood at $6.7 billion in cash and cash equivalents, as of June 30 with shares up nearly 11.3% this year.
GILDEAD SCIENCES INC :
** CEO Daniel O'Day has raised expectations for consolidation since taking the helm in March, prioritizing pipeline diversification and announcing a $5.1 billion investment in Belgo-Dutch biotech Galapagos NV, which pushed deeper into areas such as fibrosis and arthritis.
** California-based Gilead (NASDAQ:GILD) had cash and cash equivalents of $11.24 billion as of June 30. Shares up about 1% this year.

1676,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 19, 2019 03:21PM ET</span>",Plant-based meat alternatives crowd U.S. grocery stores,"(Reuters) - Plant-based meat alternatives have seen booming interest from consumers, prompting a growing number of companies to enter the space in hopes of carving out a spot for their products in the competitive supermarket aisle.
Consumers increasingly want to reduce their meat consumption amid growing concerns over health risks, animal welfare and environmental hazards.
Spurred by the success of California-based Beyond Meat (DE:BYND), veteran meat companies have also entered the market.
Shoppers at U.S. grocery stores have many plant-based options, with several companies planning to roll out meat alternatives by the end of this year.
Here is a list of plant-based products available in U.S. grocery stores:
- Beyond Meat: burgers, sausages, ground meat and crumbles made of protein from peas, brown rice, sunflower seeds and mung beans are available at more than 53,000 retailers and restaurants worldwide. In the United States, the company's products are sold at most large chains, including Amazon's (O:AMZN) Whole Foods,  Kroger Co  (N:KR) and Albertsons Companies Inc (N:ABS).
- Impossible Foods: a ""bleeding"" burger made from soy protein, the patty was originally sold only to fast-food chains, including at Burger King, which begins selling the ""Impossible Whopper"" nationwide this month. The company on July 31 received approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to sell its burger in grocery stores. Impossible said it plans to sell in select supermarkets in September, but declined to provide details on its retail launch.
- Nestle SA (S:NESN): The world's largest packaged food group seeks to sell a pea-based veggie patty called Awesome Burger under its U.S. plant-based Sweet Earth brand in supermarkets and restaurants in September or October. The company is already selling the Awesome Burger at McDonald's (N:MCD) restaurants in Germany. 
-  Tyson Foods  Inc (N:TSN): The U.S. meat producer in June launched its first vegetarian and mixed protein line, including vegetarian nuggets, blended protein burgers made from beef and pea protein, and sausages and meatballs that combine chicken with plants. The nuggets entered U.S. grocery stores in the summer, with burgers expected in the fall.

1678,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 19, 2019 02:40PM ET</span>","StockBeat: Semis Flying High, Led by Micron, as Huawei Ban Gets Pushed Back","Investing.com - Micron (NASDAQ:MU) led semiconductor stocks higher on Monday, underpinning a broader rally in tech, as Washington decided to extended a reprieve given to Huawei that allowed the Chinese telecom to continue to do business with U.S. companies. 
Also giving the sector a boost was NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), up more than 6.7% on news that Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) will use Nvidia’s RTX video graphics units to spice up the visuals of its popular world-building game ""Minecraft.""
U.S. semi suppliers like Micron Technology) that count Huawei as an important customer were given a much-needed lifeline after the U.S. extended a license that lifts restrictions on U.S. companies from selling or transferring technology to Huawei. 
The ""temporary general license"" will be extended for Huawei for 90 days, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross confirmed. The extension would give U.S. companies more time to move away from Huawei products, Ross added. 
The ban was set to be reinstated on Monday and had raised feared that U.S. semiconductor companies may have to halt shipments to Huawei, a move that could not only hurt orders but exacerbate the chip inventory overhang that has plagued the sector.
The temporary reprieve added to investor hopes that the U.S. and China would increase efforts to engage in more constructive trade talks - following a recent uptick in threats by both nations - with President Donald Trump reportedly due to meet with U.S. Ambassador to China Terry Branstad on Monday. 
Micron), Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), Advanced Micro Devices Inc (NASDAQ:AMD) and Nvidia were all set to end the day in green, though the last was boosted by its Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) announcement. 
The announcement comes just a week after Nvidia released better-than-expected earnings, led by its gaming sector, which accounts for the bulk of revenue.

1684,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 19, 2019 01:05PM ET</span>",U.S. grants Huawei another 90 days to buy from American suppliers,"By David Shepardson and Karen Freifeld
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States will extend a reprieve that permits China's Huawei Technologies to buy components from U.S. companies to supply existing customers, the Commerce Department said on Monday, but it also moved to add more than 40 of Huawei's units to its economic blacklist.
The extension, dated Thursday and first reported by Reuters on Friday, was announced by U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, even though President Donald Trump suggested on Sunday that no such reprieve would be granted. 
Shares of U.S. chip makers that sell to Huawei rose, including those of Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) , Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU). 
The 90-day extension ""is intended to afford consumers across America the necessary time to transition away from Huawei equipment, given the persistent national security and foreign policy threat,"" the department said in a statement.
""As we continue to urge consumers to transition away from Huawei’s products, we recognize that more time is necessary to prevent any disruption,"" said Ross.
Huawei said in a statement that the temporary extension ""does not change the fact that Huawei has been treated unjustly. Today's decision won't have a substantial impact on Huawei's business either way.""
Trump had indicated over the weekend that there would be no extension, saying what would happen would be the ""opposite"" of what was reported on Friday. ""We're actually open not to doing business with them,"" Trump said on Sunday.
The U.S. government blacklisted Huawei in May, alleging the Chinese company is involved in activities contrary to U.S. national security or foreign policy interests.
Shortly after the blacklisting, the Commerce Department allowed Huawei to purchase some American-made goods in a move designed to minimize disruption for its customers, including rural U.S. telecommunications firms that use Huawei equipment in their networks. Ross said the latest extension also was aimed at aiding those same customers.
At the same time, he said he was adding 46 Huawei affiliates to the so-called ""Entity List"" - a list of companies effectively banned from doing businesses with U.S. firms - raising the total number to more than 100 Huawei entities covered by the restrictions.
The list includes Huawei affiliates in Argentina, Australia, Belarus, China, Costa Rica, France, India, Italy, Mexico and numerous other countries.
Huawei said it opposes the decision to add another 46 affiliates to the Entity List. ""It's clear that this decision, made at this particular time, is politically motivated and has nothing to do with national security,"" the company said.
'PLENTY OF NOTICE' 
The extension, through Nov. 18, renews an agreement continuing the Chinese company's ability to maintain existing telecommunications networks and provide software updates to Huawei handsets. 
The Commerce Department also said on Monday it is requiring the exporter, re-exporter, or transferor to obtain a certification statement from any Huawei entity prior to using the temporary general license.
Asked what will happen in November to U.S. customers of Huawei, Ross said: ""Everybody has had plenty of notice of it, there have been plenty of discussions with the president.""
The semiconductor industry has lobbied to sell non-sensitive items that Huawei could easily buy abroad, arguing that a blanket ban harms American companies.
When the Commerce Department blocked Huawei from buying U.S. goods earlier this year, it was seen as a major escalation in the Sino-U.S. trade war.
As an example, the blacklisting order cited a pending federal criminal case concerning allegations that Huawei violated U.S. sanctions against Iran. Huawei has pleaded not guilty in the case.
The order noted that the indictment also accused Huawei of “deceptive and obstructive acts.” 
At the same time, the United States says Huawei's smartphones and network equipment could be used by China to spy on Americans, allegations the company has repeatedly denied.
Huawei, the world's largest telecommunications equipment maker, is still prohibited from buying American parts and components to manufacture new products without additional special licenses.
Many Huawei suppliers have requested the special licenses to sell to the firm. Ross told reporters late last month he had received more than 50 applications, and that he expected to receive more. He said on Monday that there were no ""specific licenses being granted for anything.""
Washington trade lawyer Doug Jacobson said it is not surprising the extension was granted: ""It takes time for telecom providers to find alternative equipment suppliers.""

Of $70 billion that Huawei spent buying components in 2018, about $11 billion went to U.S. companies.

1689,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 19, 2019 12:51PM ET</span>",Factbox: Rescue plan for Italian bank Carige,"MILAN (Reuters) - Italian banks have agreed a rescue plan for Carige (MI:CRGI) led by the country's depositor protection fund (FITD), which will shoulder the bulk of a 900 million euro ($999 million) cash injection.
Aimed at avoiding a liquidation or resolution of the bank, the plan requires the backing of Carige's shareholders, who will meet on Sept. 20 to approve the proposed capital increase.
Following is a summary of the bank's situation and the rescue plan:
WHY DOES CARIGE NEED RESCUING?
Weakened by decades of mismanagement, Carige was placed under temporary administration by the European Central Bank on Jan. 2 after its top investor - the Malacalza family of steel entrepreneurs - in December blocked a 400 million euro cash call.
Carige's administrators have been trying to attract interest from potential bidders but negotiations have proved difficult. A rescue led by BlackRock (N:BLK) collapsed in May.
Rome has sought to stave off a liquidation while avoiding an injection of taxpayer funds, as the previous government did with both Monte dei Paschi di Siena (MI:BMPS) and two Veneto-based lenders in 2017.
This has left the burden of rescuing Carige with Italian banks, which already in November bought a 320 million euro convertible bond through the FITD fund to prop up Carige.
WHAT ARE THE MAIN ELEMENTS OF THE PLAN?
The plan envisages a 700 million euros share issue and 200 million euros of new Tier2 capital.
Carige said on Monday it would issue 700 billion new shares at 0.001 euros each.
The FITD fund, financed by the country's banks, will cover almost two thirds of the capital strengthening by converting into equity 313 million euros of the bond it bought from Carige in late 2018 and by buying new shares for 239 million euros.
The FITD has also pledged to take on any shares left unsubscribed by Carige's current shareholders, who can buy into the cash call for up to 85 million euros.
Carige has said it has received binding commitments by several investors for its 200 million euro Tier 2 issue.
ROLE OF CASSA CENTRALE BANCA
The FITD cannot be a long-term investor in Carige and unlisted cooperative banking group Cassa Centrale Banca (CCB) has an option to buy the FITD's stake at a deep discount between mid-2020 and the end of 2021.
CCB has emerged as the only Italian bank willing to make a direct investment in Carige after others said they were not interested unless the state bankrolled the deal. CCB will initially invest 63 million euros for a stake of just under 10% in Carige.
SOURED LOANS
Under the plan, Italy's state-owned bad loan specialist SGA will purchase almost all of Carige's impaired loans for a total of 3.1 billion euros, lowering their share of total lending to below 5%.
WHAT WILL THE MALACALZAS DO?
It is not yet clear whether the plan has the backing of the Malcalzas, who own 27.5 percent of Carige and could sink the proposed rescue as they blocked the previous capital raising.

1694,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 19, 2019 10:09AM ET</span>",Stocks: Wall Street Surges as U.S. Extends Huawei Leniency,"Investing.com -- U.S. stocks surged at the start of the new week, with the Dow Jones rising nearly 300 points as the federal government signaled more soft-pedaling on the trade war with China for the time being.
The Commerce Department said it will extend for another 90 days the “temporary and limited” exemptions for U.S. companies doing business with Chinese telecoms giant Huawei, citing the need to avoid disruption to local U.S. phone services.
“As we continue to urge consumers to transition away from Huawei’s products, we recognize that more time is necessary to prevent any disruption,” Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross said in a statement.
The news helped push fears of an imminent recession back to the back burner, recouping more of last week’s losses.
By 9:45 AM ET, the Dow was up 283 points or 1.1% at 26,169 points, while the S&P 500 was up 34 points, a gain of 1.2%, and the Nasdaq Composite was up 115 points, or 1.5%.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) led the market higher with a 2.8% rise, boosted by hints from President Donald Trump that he could tweak his proposed sanctions on China, where Apple makes its iPhones, so as to shore up its competitive position vis-à-vis Samsung (KS:005930).
Chipmakers Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) and Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) – all of them sensitive to trade-related concerns - also outperformed.
Another big gainer was   Estee Lauder   (NYSE:EL), which rose 9.1% after reporting underlying earnings 20% ahead of consensus and forecasting a much stronger end to its fiscal year than analysts expected, thanks to buoyant demand for premium skin care products, especially in Asia.
The return of risk appetite to stocks also helped to unwind the ugly-looking technicals of the bond market, which had provoked such unease among investors last week. The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note touched 1.62%, its highest since Wednesday, and nine basis points above the benchmark two-year note.
That gave analysts more confidence to downplay the inversion of two- and 10-year yields last week. While every recession in recent times has been preceded by such a pattern, not every inversion has led to a recession.
“The curve inversion might be more an indicator of extreme market nervousness at present, of increasing central banks action, skewed bond ownership, and of global search for yield, rather than a sure sign that the U.S. is about to enter a recession,” JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) analysts led by Mislav Matejka wrote in a note to clients.
Elsewhere, U.S. crude oil futures traded briefly above $56 for the first time since Wednesday before retreating to $55.72, up 1.6% on the day. Gold futures went in the opposite direction, losing 1.1% to $1506.09 a troy ounce."
1695,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 19, 2019 09:56AM ET</span>","Equinor, Gazprom lose European gas market share as LNG surges","By Ekaterina Kravtsova
LONDON (Reuters) - Europe's two biggest suppliers of pipeline gas, Norway's Equinor and Russia's Gazprom (MCX:GAZP), have lost market share for the first time in at least four years amid a tripling in liquefied natural gas (LNG) imports into the region over the past 10 months.
LNG imports into Europe have jumped amid lower than expected spot demand from Asia, which has helped to send European gas prices to 10-year lows and filled European storages to multi-year highs.
Data compiled by Refinitiv showing changes in the market share of gas from Norway, Russia and LNG sources is the latest example of how LNG is transforming Europe's gas market.
Graphic: Gas flows to Europe - Market share — https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/ce/7/5988/5971/Pasted%20Image.jpg
The share of LNG in gas supplied to western and central Europe increased to 14% between October 2018 and August 2019 from 5% in the same period of 2017-18.
The share of Norwegian gas dropped to 33% from 38%, a multi-year low, calculations by Refinitiv show.
Gazprom's share was around the average of the past three years, edging down by 1% from the previous year to 32%. But it was the first year-on-year drop since 2014-2015, when it was hit by low gas demand in Europe.
LNG from the United States into northwest Europe accounted for 2% of total gas supply into the region, contributing to the strong increase in LNG in Europe.
Despite its market share loss, Gazprom's total gas exports to Europe rose as the region imported 9% more gas from October to August, compared with the same period in 2017-2018.

""Most of the increase which we see in Russian supply this year came to Slovakia and the Czech Republic - countries which do not have direct access to LNG and which need to prepare their storages in case transit via Ukraine stops from January 2020,"" said Marina Tsygankova, gas market analyst at Refinitiv.
The gas transit agreement between Russia and Ukraine is due to expire at the end of this year. The lack of progress in talks has spurred Europe to stockpile gas to prevent possible supply disruption in winter.
In countries with LNG terminals, Russian flows have given some ground to LNG volumes, an LNG market source said.
The drop in Norwegian flows, meanwhile, was seller-driven, with Equinor conducting extensive maintenance on its production and also reducing output, probably for commercial reasons.
In contrast, a drop in Russian gas flows to some western European countries, such as Germany, was buyer-driven.
""If I have a long-term contract and some flexibility left, I would run the contract low now and ramp it up again in September or later,"" a gas trader in Europe said, pointing to current low spot prices.
A drop in Dutch production has also helped to create room for LNG arrivals.
The analysis was based on gas volumes for Germany, France, Austria, the Netherlands, Britain, Belgium, the Czech Republic and Slovakia from October to August over the past six years."

1698,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 19, 2019 09:24AM ET</span>","U.S. to Ease Huawei Sanctions for Another 90 Days, Wilbur Ross Says","(Bloomberg) -- The U.S. will delay for 90 days restrictions the Trump administration has imposed on some business operations of China’s Huawei Technologies Co., Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said Monday.
Some telecom companies in the U.S. are ""dependent"" on Huawei, and thus a 90-day reprieve was deemed appropriate, Ross said in an interview with Fox Business’s Maria Bartiromo.
""We’re giving them a little more time to wean themselves off,"" he added. Ross said the next deadline will be around Nov. 19. He added that Commerce decided to place 46 more Huawei subsidiaries on its entity list.
The announcement followed an upbeat tweet from President Donald Trump over the weekend indicating the U.S. was “doing very well with China, and talking.”
Huawei, China’s largest technology company by sales, has been at the heart of worsening tensions and been called a bargaining chip in thorny trade negotiations between Washington and Beijing. Trump had said he anticipated talking with Chinese President Xi Jinping “very soon” and the Huawei move may sweeten the tone of those discussions.
Huawei, for its part, has been trying to carry on operations in face of U.S. sanctions on the sale of the vital technology. The company this month announced its in-house HarmonyOS, an open-source operating system that could one day serve as a replacement for  Google Inc  (NASDAQ:GOOGL).’s Android if its access to that software is curtailed.
Without Android or the numerous American silicon, technology and consultancy suppliers that Huawei does business with, many of its most promising product lines would either cease their rapid growth or be thwarted entirely.
The U.S. Commerce Department previously granted a three-month temporary license to Huawei’s U.S. customers shortly after the Trump administration blacklisted the Chinese company. That allowed telecom carriers in rural areas to continue using Huawei equipment and Google to provide only key Android security updates to Huawei phones."
1699,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 19, 2019 09:06AM ET</span>",Juul raises $325 million in equity and debt financing for global expansion,"(Reuters) - U.S. e-cigarette maker Juul Labs Inc has raised $325 million in an equity and debt offering to speed up its global reach at a time of intense regulatory scrutiny in its home market.
The company did not break out the ratio of equity and debt offered, but a source familiar with the matter told Reuters that Juul sold convertible debt in a bridge financing to bolster its balance sheet.
Juul, 35% owned by Marlboro maker  Altria Group  (NYSE:MO) Inc, has over the past year focused its efforts on growing outside the United States, as American regulators increase oversight of e-cigarette products that are wildly popular among teenagers.
The company launched its products in South Korea, Philippines and Indonesia at around the same time the city of San Francisco, where Juul is headquartered, approved an ordinance to ban the sale and distribution of e-cigarettes until manufacturers get approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. 
In July, a U.S. federal court ordered e-cigarette companies to submit applications to the FDA within 10 months to remain in the market, instead of in 2022. 
The latest funding round comes a year after Juul, which launched its products in 2015, raised about $1.25 billion to fund its explosive growth. Last December, it received about $12.5 billion from Altria for a stake in the company.
